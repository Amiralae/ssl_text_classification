2	  I love it . I lost the original one I purchased from Best Buy at $ 59.00 . This was a great deal . Thanks Amazon .  
2	  Sony KDL-40V2500 40 " Bravia V-Series 1080p LCD HDTVI recieved the Item very promptly , It was easy to set up and has a very good picture , especially with HDTV reception .  
1	  Never worked right from the start it has a short in the audio plugs I was very disappointed in this buy I would not recommend this product to anyone  
2	  I 've been using this product for over one year now and find it to be fantastic . I 've had only minor issues installing , works fine on win XP . After developing wrist strain using a traditional mouse which forces you to position your wrist to hold the mouse , I 've had great improvements while using the touchpad . It didn't take very long to get used to the action , a light touch is all it takes . Scrolling is great - just move your finger along the edge of the pad . Clicks can be performed right on the pad , or using the buttons . It allows you to position your wrist any way you 'd like and use a light touch from any finger desired to guide the pointer . Can't say enough good , will never go back to a mouse .  
1	  This one kind of .. It has these rubberized protectors molded over the end clip levers that are very difficult to release when the cable is installed . I finally removed it and bought one at Staples which works great .  
1	  tinny sound - big mistake to have purchased it - invest in a couple of auxiliary speakers instead  
2	  Yeah , I 've owned some pretty awful printers , and some very good ones . About 6 years ago , I had a printer that cost over three times what this one cost me , and now it pales in comparison . This thing is FAST , no kidding . About a year ago , I bought a panaphobic ( sic ) multi-function that [ was horrible ] . It was about 1/3 the advertised speed and got super hot . Not to mention the fact that it stopped working with my computer and I had to relegate it to coppier / fax status . After that experience , this printer is a dream . It was truly plug and play through my USB port . I only had to install a driver , unlike other comp ( hp ) anies that make you install an entire , and useless , print package . As statd above , it starts and prints FAST , even while " sleeping . " The print quality is exactly what I expected . I almost never print graphics and didn't want anything to do with an inkjet . When I saw this printer , I could hardly believe a laser printer could be had at this price , especially one built like an office printer . I read some other reviews about the printer getting dirty and printing dirty . I haven't had that problem , and there are cleaning tips right on the printer . The single sheet feeder works well when printing envelopes , and I haven't had opportunity to feed a sheet so I can't comment . Go to a store and check it out . It feels and looks solid . I am happy with it and hope you will be too ! Of course , I have to mention that this printer would benefit from an Infared port , even at an increased price .  
1	  I have developed pain in my hands , mostly my thumbs from excessive keyboarding and probably some arthritis . I ordered this keyboard with hopes of improving my condition . I wish I had read the negative reviews closer . While there are many features that are good and the general feel of the keyboard is comfortable , the space bar was a deal breaker for me . My thumbs are already so sore , having to press the space bar so hard made my condition even worse ! Sorry , but I will be returning it .  
1	  This adapter does not work with Windows Me . Although it appears to have all the features you want at a really nice price , the D-link card is not a good value . In comparison to a premium card , such as Xircom or 3Com , the D-Link card uses 5 volts instead of 3.3 volts , which drains a portable PC 's battery much faster . Also , the D-Link card does not have cell phone hookups or a global modem , which limits its use even further . Finally , the company 's web site has sparse technical data and the phone technical support department operates on a ' call-back ' system that very rarely returns calls .  
2	  We use this as a home copier / printerGood points : Instant on - it 's great not to have to waitHigh quality printingReasonably fast print speed2-in-1 button copies two 8x11 pages , reduced , onto one sheetBad points : Can't be connected to wireless network with Windows Vista or 7 - main reason we 're replacing itPaper jams are inconvenient to fix - no matter how simple the jam , you have to nearly take the machine apartLED screen is often hard to see in poor light conditionsNo count of prints in progress - this is surprisingly annoyingNo easy interrupt - there 's a two-or-three - step process involving that dim LED screenNo two-sided printingNo auto-sense for manual paper feed , so half the time I forget and it copies from the main tray  
2	  The cable works pretty good . Connecting my old desktop to my Sony 1080P works well enough . Not amazing rez .. but that 's expected considering its no HDMI . The only problem i have with it , is the weird smell .. Might just be the seller i bought it from though . Either way its gross . If you 've ever purchased car air freshener , you 've probably encountered bottled " New Car Smell " before . Well , the cable smells like someone dumped the whole bottle on it , then peed on it for extra measure . If they are all like this , you may also have to wash it off with a wet rag like i did .  
1	  My 3 / win2k systems do not see or work with this unit . My NT4.0 sp6 does see it and works fine . Dlinks tech support had me add Netwre Client and NWLink Protocols to my Win2k systems , would still not work , they then told me to update the printservers firmware to 1,38 , but this is not available on their site anywhere . This thing was made in 1997 ! and has not been updated to work with newer OS 's . If you only have NT 4 systems go ahead and get it . But if you have any NEW systems ( OS ) then pass it by .  
1	  TThe product I received does not have a standard Laptop USB connector on it but rather some more narrow but thicker connector to which I have not found a USB Port of any standard computer that it fits nor is it the same as the unit you purchase directly from APPLE . As such the units I have are on no value . Make certain you see the size and get written demonsions of unit when ordering . If you have to spend the money to return it to the Manufacucter it will most likely cost more than you paid for the unit in the first place . My recommendation is do not buy . Thus the rating of zero stars . the unit shipped does not even plug into the ciggaret lighter adaptor that they ship . It is correct and works with my factory product . If anyone in the companies quality control had tried even to put the peice together they would find that they are not correct .  
2	  No , it doesn't look exactly like the picture , like others noted . But it works fine and I got it in two days . Very satisfied .  
1	  I bought this router and a Linksys wireless card 1-1/2 years ago . The router crapped out at the end of its 1-year warranty and they sent me a replacement . It lasted 6 months and crapped out , but since my total warranty period was 1-year , I have to buy a new router . The wireless card lasted until a month ago and I replaced it with a Belkin card with a " lifetime " warranty . Linksys Tech support was exported to India and they try but the language problem is there . I will not buy Linksys products again .  
2	  This is a great cable at a fantastic low price . I would certainly order cables from here again .  
2	  I purchased these after losing a pair of Sony MDR-G32s ( which were incredible headphones , albeit uncomfortable ) . I decided to purchase these to see what the competition with Sony sounded like . Plus , they were $ 10 less than the comparable Sony set . When I got the package in the mail , I was excited to try them out . After initially plugging them in , I was treated to a very rich , clear , and undistorted sound right out of the package . I 'd definitely say that the bass was not nearly as much as I got out of the previous pair of Sony 's I owned , but the sound was much clearer . The other thing I quickly realized , playing around with these , is that they can get to ear-shattering volume levels , without any noticeable distortion . Now , I am no true audiophile , and so there may have been some minor distortion , but I definitely didn't notice . This pair is also much more comfortable than my previous pair . They feel very light on the head , and after awhile you just kind of forget about them being there . The old Sony 's I had had these funny rubber guides on them to fit over my ears , and after an extended period of wearing them , they would becomes exceedingly uncomfortable . Not a problem with the PMX-60 . I do have a couple minor gripes I had after using them for awhile . First off , they do leak sound , as some had said , moreso than most headphones . Granted , these are designed to be open air phones , and so naturally they would be expected to leak some , but the amount that is leaked ( even at very low volume levels ) was more than I initially imagined . At max volume levels , these things can be used as mini speakers , which I suppose is interesting , but for most uses , you don't want a whole lot of sound leakage . So no libraries ( or other extremely quiet places ) for the PMX-60 . If you 're in one of those situations , the guy sitting next to you will definitely be able to hear what you 're listening to . Moderately loud areas shouldn't be an issue , though . One more minor thing is that these don't fold up . My old pair did , and I liked being able to stick them in smaller places where I was confident that they wouldn't be crushed . With these , I usually leave them around my neck , as I fear for their safety anywhere else . Overall , I think Sennheiser put together a solid product , and if you don't mind some sound leakage that slightly above the norm , this product is definitely for you . Rich , clean , undistorted sound from a lightweight and comfortable package . - Jared  
1	  I think maybe I 'm having a bad experience with WRT54GS because I 'm using both XP and OS X. Every other day , the router stop responding , then I can't even connect to the router until I reset it . I upgraded the firmware to the latest , 1.50.9 released 10/1/06 . It worked fine for a couple of weeks , then my mac mini couldn't get any DHCP assigned , even it was connected with Ethernet . This is a known problem , but Linksys hasn't been updated their firmware , and the user can't download older version of firmware from their site . I didn't see Apple OS X as one of supported OS , so I guess it 's not a Linksys ' fault . But if you 're using an OS X , you should avoid this router .  
1	  This piece of hardware is nice and small . It would be good if you didn't have to keep up with a cord in addition to the unit , but the only other option is having a big wart on the side of your laptop . As a card reader this one is decent , however , I regret buying it and feel mislead by the marketing on the packaging . I bought this unit because of it 's claim to support micro-SD cards ; however , it doesn't seem to support them directly , but instead through a separate mini-SD to SD adapter . The whole reason that I got this was because I didn't want to have to deal with the adapter .. grr .  
1	  My son and I bought this item from JC Penney - twice . We returned it both times . Neither one worked . Okay , the blue light came on , but no radio , nothing else . We cranked and cranked and cranked and it didn't help . We were disappointed , and I am now looking for a much , much better weather radio .  
1	  Two months ago , I bought the Stylus 750 to replace an aging Kodak digital . Unlike the Kodak , the Olympus has no " delete all phots " feature , so the only way to delete all the photos from the camera after transfering to the computer is to look at each photo separately on the camera 's LCD display , push the delete button on the back of the camera , confirm that I really want to delete it , then it 's gone . One photo gone and 235 to go . It takes about 10 minutes to delete every hundred photos ( each deletion requires 3 button pushes , one picture at a time ) . I 've now bought a replacement camera ( a Canon ) that has a " delete all photos " option . I never would have guessed that a camera would be sold that made it so hard to delete the photos . It 's a flaw that makes the camera functionally so clunky that I 'd advise looking to another manufacturer for your digital camera purchase .  
2	  This was an upgrade for me from an 8.0MP Digital Rebel XT-which was my first DSLR camera-so I will compare my experiences with the two . Digital Rebel XT 8.0MP : Pros : price , weight , ease of use . Cons : very noisy focusing and shooting . feels cheaply put together and mass produced ( the latter is certainly true ) ; feels and looks like an entry level DSLR camera ( which , granted , is what it is ) . tends to overexpose pictures outdoors , and underexpose pictures indoors . ease of use comes at the sacrifice of desirable controls that just aren't there . D80 10.2MP : Pros : Solid look and feel . The 11-area autofocus system makes a HUGE difference , at least to me , and enables much better control and less wasted time trying to focus how I want to than the Rebel XT . Looks and feels serious and solid , like it means business . far more features and controls than the Rebel XT ( which does make it harder to use , however ) much quieter focusing and shooting . Excellent low light exposure , far better than the XT ( using their respective kit lenses ) . Colors seem more rich and vibrant than the XT , and bright colors seem to " pop " more . This kit lens is of FAR better quality than the horrible kit lens that came with the Rebel XT . This kit lens does not live up to the usual kit lens reputation . It far exceeds it . Cons : price ( still near impossible to find one of these for a steal ) , weight ( it feels solid and well constructed , but you pay for that with the weight . my hand never got tired with the Rebel XT , it gets tired with this . I don't mind it though because I know it is more solidly built ) , seems to underexpose outdoors , but the detail and colors seem richer . ( I 'm sure once I get more familiar with the controls I will be able to tweak this ) , uses SD cards instead of CF . While the kit lens is far better than the Rebel XT kit lens , it does show more of a pincushion effect than the kit lens of the Rebel XT . Now , I realize that to be fair the D80 should be compared side by side to the Rebel XTi , not the Rebel XT , but again I don't have the experience to do that . I can only speak from my own personal experience based on what I have owned and used . Bottom line , to me this seems like a great midway point between entry-level DSLR and true professional DSLR . It seems to straddle the two ends of that spectrum very nicely in terms of picture quality , price , controls , and features . I can tell that this camera is going to make me a better photographer . I am still very happy that I started out with the Rebel XT , however , and if a friend of mine asked me for advice on buying their first DSLR I would probably recommend the Digital Rebel XT because it is so easy to use . I mean the Rebel is basically a glorified point and shoot camera with a mechanical shutter , ability to change lenses , and much better picture quality . Please pardon my slight hyperbole there , but hopefully you get the point . The Rebel XT takes zero know-how to use . For a beginner this is perfect if you ask me . Someone who knows how to use a point and shoot will quickly be able to master the Rebel XT . The D80 takes much more know-how to use but so far as I can tell that is a good thing if you are serious about photography . It is going to push me to be a better and more knowledgeable photographer , and it enables me to fine tune my pictures for better results . In one sentence : Digital Rebel XT : instant gratification . Nikon D80 : better gratification , but not instant .  
2	  Nice photos for a very good price , a big bargain for a 2,1 Mpixel camara - Some troubles with the lens that can easy to get grooves . This is a very reliable equipment with fast and close-up captures .  
1	  The camera case is worthless - it doesn't seal at all so pieces can easily fall out and dust can go in . Of course , the battery and charger are very useful , so simply buy the charger individually and then purchase a REAL camera case and a lens cleaner . You won't miss those 5 pieces of paper .  
1	  I was really excited to get my hands on a quality B + W filter to see what it could do compared to my 20 + year old Vivitar c-pol and man was I disappointed . Pictures look desaturated and the effect of the polarizer isn't right . Skies became more gray and reflections weren't reduced in the same fashion as before . Some colors shifted pretty badly in pictures . Overall I feel like this was a bad purchased and I 'm looking for another filter . I bought the slim version to reduce vignetting , but not at the expense of picture quality .  
1	  If you don't care about WOL the card works fine . My system requires a 3-pin WOL cable to connect the LAN card to the system board . The LNE100TX item description says it has one , but the card that came ( version 5 ) does not have this type of interface . Check for compatibility before you buy it ! I ended up returning mine .  
2	  Product was exactly what i expected and shipped fast . Maybe it 's because i live in the next city but i got my product the next day .  
1	  Tried using this on 2 machines ( 1 mac , 1 pc ) with 2 different monitors each . This cable caused ghosting no matter what machine or monitor was used . It was a good deal for a cable , but I got what I paid for . Not even worth paying to ship it back because the price was so good !  
2	  I bought this card on the basis that I had a sorround sound system to use and my old card couldn't do it . If you hook up SPDIF via the Digital I / O Module your receiver will actually change to the sound format that best fits the movie your playing and will switch back to the regular PCM sound afte the movie . The card is great . I have no complaints . I highly recommend it .  
1	  worst . camera . EVER !  
2	  I had previously bought the Garmin StreetPilot c330 . After using it for a week , I returned it because it 's didn't have Text to Speech , so it didn't tell me street names while I was driving . It was so hard to look down and see what street I was to turn onto . I am SO happy about my new Nuvi 360 . The TTS ( Text to Speech ) is indispensable . Now I don't have to look at the device while driving , just listen . And I don't miss the side volume knob at all , just a simple click of the power button brings up the volume / brightness feature . However , I don't use the bluetooth feature . Synching it up with my phone is a waste of time because it 's hard to be heard when I use hands free calling . It 's not a big deal , I love the other features so much it 's worth it . Another great feature is the size . I didn't think it mattered , but I just slip the GPS in my pocket or jacket pocket when I get out of the car . Overall , I highly recommend this unit . Maybe don't bother with the bluetooth feature , but it 's not much more expensive so whichever you choose . Enjoy . UPDATE MARCH ! 8 , 2008 : This thing is still great . We love it !  
2	  i love this device you can store100 cd 's and also if you have more than one you can stack them . the software that comes with it is pretty good but it could be better or updated . other than that it is great i love it .  
1	  Despite linux support being explicitly stated on the packaging , there is no official linux support for this device . I called TrippLite , and they told me that they no longer have these drivers anywhere , despite advertising linux support . They also seemed surprised when I told them that it was clearly on the box , and I had to send them a picture to prove it . If you want support for linux , DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE . That being said , it worked just fine in Windows 7 .  
2	  You must read the reference manual thoroughly located in CDROM to have best picture quality . Tip : It is useful to utilize half-pressed shutter button mode before taking pictures . Press shutter button very lightly and hold . ( see manual for details ) Use high current-hour capacity battery for outdoor pictures . Make yourself familiar with battery life cycle trends . Battery may die more quickly in continuous monitor mode and flash light . I think D-510zoom is best buy for the price , but do not expect highend quality . Sorry for bad english .  
1	  The memory card would never format in my camera , although several others could . Good news .. I sent it back !  
2	  With both options Firewire or USB 2.0 You can use all the drives that have files on them . This on was able get some files off an old maxtor and The Drive is fried but I got the files off of it useing this unit  
1	  This is the worst headphone I have ever bought . It 's actually quite sad . The sound is great . Problem is - on your ears , the little ' phones stick <i & gt ; away < / i & gt ; from your ears . So there is : - NO MUSIC THAT U HEAR - NO ISOLATION - LOTS OF AMBIENT NOISE - NOT HIGHLY EFFICIENTAll in all , great headphones that refuse to let u listen . QUITE ANNOYING . And I shelled out $ 10 for these . Oh , well .. IF YOU HAVE A HUGE HEAD - the problem of the speakers jumpin away from your ears at an akward angle is non-existent . My sister uses these phones , and she loves em . If you 're like me , and have an average-sized head , or have an average-to-small sized head without any hair hanging down , these probably won't fit on you very well .  
1	  A waste of time and not worth the frustration . Not sturdy or adjustable enough to hold the crappy projector it came with . Waste of money .  
1	  This is a great scanner , BUT I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE WHO MIGHT WANT TO HAVE ACCESS TO A HARD COPY OF THE DETAILED USER MANUAL / GUIDE . So if you have 24/7 internet access to the HTML only guide then fine , as long as you have the time to drill down / through it for what you want . Called Epson support and they confirmed that such a guide does not exist for this $ 750 scanner . Not even a pdf version , so now I have to download every page , print to pdf , and compile one - that I will publish to the internet when done so others can benefit from Epson 's weird documentation support philosophy .  
2	  It 's been almost 4 years since I bought the Zen Xtra and it 's still the only HD based mp3 player I 've used ( I have a Sansa m230 that I use when I run ) . I 've never had to return it or get it repaired and it still works great . The ONLY flaw I 've had with this player is if I jostle it too hard it will shut itself off and upon powering it on it will display the " Reorganizing the music library " message ( I forget exactly what it says ) and when its finished ( takes about 3 minutes for having 25gb + music ) doing that it will resume where it left off . So that 's my long-term experience with this player . It was also way cheaper than the Ipod at the same capacity when I bought it so I 'm one satisfied customer . ;)  
2	  # - # - # - [ Why this rating ? ] - # - # - # Some 2 years ago , when I bought my HV20 , I did a lot of research on tapes , and the consensus overwhelmingly pointed to the Panasonic AMQ family . So far , with over 50 tapes used , I am a happy camper indeed - no dropouts , and great quality . I am a true believer now , and hence the 5-star " I Love It ! " rating . # - # - # - [ Tape Types ] - # - # - # Irrespective of the tape you decide to use , I learned that it was more important to be loyal to the type of lubricant used - referred to by my friends as wet or dry tapes . The Panasonic belongs to the dry type family , whereas Sony tapes use a wet lubricant . For instance , Panasonic claims that this tape uses a " .. dry type lubricant [ that ] causes less video head wear ( - 4m after 500H ) . It also prevents head clogs and extends head life . " While some on the ' net argue that this distinction is an urban myth - I decided to trust my professional friends on this issue . This difference is not material until you switch between the two types - which can lead to clogged video heads . # - # - # - [ Archival ] - # - # - # I rely very heavily on tape as an archival mechanism for all my HD masters . Hence my decision to go with the AMQ series over the PQ series ( which are a bit cheaper ) . Happy Recording ! - Damodar  
1	  I spent several days on making it work on my notebook , but I failed . It worked well on my friends'notebook . I didn't know why it was not fit to mine . I enquried the manufactuer , but they could not provide any help . So I returned it .  
1	  i got this expctng a 2 way splitter but only one slot worked on it , any other cable splitter would work but this cheap piece of crap !  
1	  My first GPS . It was pretty expensive and had lots of nice features ( ability to save many tracks ) . The software is very US-centric . It worked very well on the flat and in unwooded conditions . However don't use one of these things to navigate in the bush ( use a compass ) . The technology is just not there to cope with either valleys or an overhead canopy . It was handy to confrm where I was when I found a clearing on top of a hill . Finally although the battery life is better than most it is still abysmal . In summary these things are still a toy for a tramper rather than an essential tool .  
2	  I bought a 4 pack of MAHA batteries and the charger which came with them . I was tired of buying new batteries periodically and the hazards of disposing of used alkaline batteries never crossed my mind . I later bought another 4pack of batteries without a charger . I have several remote controls for various pieces of electronic equipment and always want to be sure that everything is working properly . There is nothing worse than having flat batteries in your remote control while trying to make a recording . When the batteries arrived with the charger , they were individually wrapped in polyethylene . I made the mistake of only removing the plastic over the terminals . This way , the batteries are difficult to get into the charger and seldom make good contact once in the charger . The instruction sheet which came with my charger was on a small piece of paper folded over twice . I couldn't read it without a magnifying glass . Before I learned what the smart charger does , I worried about memory developing in the batteries and carefully timed the charging . If only I had known about the indicator lights on the charger ! The trouble was with the instructions being too small to read , even the best - intentioned user probably won't have read them . Thankfully , I found the instructions here in . pdf format . The tiny instruction sheet had a table of charging times versus the number of cells in the charger . As I recall it takes four hours to charge four new cells and less time for fewer . and even less time depending on the charge of the batteries . Both from an economic as well as an environmental standpoint , these batteries are a wise purchase .  
2	  I researched HDMI cables before buying my first set . I did not want pay 30.00 or 40.00 bucks for these things when less expensive ones worked just as well . I would recommend these DVI HDMI cables to anyone .  
1	  I bought this equipment less than a year ago for one of the bedrooms of our new Bed and Breakfast . The machine has been used no more than 10 times and was never able to read most of the DVD of our collection . I called customer support and was able to speak with a real American ( Congratulations to Go Video for this ) . He told me to clean the lenzes with a special disk that could be bought at Radio Shack which I did . But the reader kept skipping tracks randomely even after the cleaning . I called Customer Support again and the told me that they would exchange the machine for $ 59.99 plus shipping charges . What a highway robbery . I 'll just take it to our dump , write off the cost of the machine and will buy a Panasonic .  
2	  I got this HDMI cable for my ps3 and LCD tv and it works just as good as a $ 20 dollar cable i bought . I ended up returning it so i saved $ 19 bucks . AWESOME .  
2	  The cheapest I could get the HDMI cablesFrom other stores was $ 30.00 , I got 5 forUnder $ 2.00 ea . Life is good ! & # 128077 ;  
1	  Top of the video screen slurs . Battery barely lasts for 1 movieScreen active for music CD play . Over all , the product should beavoided .  
1	  I was excited and even bought two ( one for me and one for my sister out of state ) . Then , I had weird pop ups and after looking around on the Internet , it looks like there might be a virus with the software . Unfortunately , I still don't have the issue resolved and the webcam is in the " techie dead pile . " Additionally , my sister has been having " registry " problems , which I think is due to the camera . DONT BUY .  
1	  Despite the description stating its for 96-02 Cadillacs , it does not work with my 97 Seville . After I started to assemble the wiring , I happened to notice that on the package , it did not note it was compatible with my car . Being the optimistic guy that I try to be , I still wired everything together only to notice that sound only came out of my front driver door . I did some research on this , and on my car . It turns out , that my car has an amp for the speakers , which this harness did not support .  
1	  The vertical steam is useless , the cordless functions is convenient , however the ironing potential is very short it will iron an area no longer that the size of a sheet of paper before it cools again needing to be place back in the charging base . Therefore ironing with this iron takes longer , the great feature is that it goes off by itself when idol , making it great for seniors like myself .  
2	  I purchased this D-Link ADSL2/2 + modem / router to replace a very old Westell DSL modem that was no longer performing well . The D-Link product provided a very easy " out of the box " installation and the UI for further configuration after connectivity was established automatically was clear and easy to use . I 'm very pleased with my purchase and believe this modem / router will keep things working well until VZ finally makes FiOS available in my neighborhood later this year .  
2	  This was a great portable flashdrive for storage of data to be taken from my home computer to school for projects . Lots of storage space and a great price . I ordered two for my kids . Easier than burning CDs and much less fragile . Thanks !  
2	  This is a great little recording device . It is very small , easy to operate , and the clarity is quite good .. better than what I expected from something this small .  
1	  I used this device for several months . It would randomly drop its connection back to the wireless router it was connecting with . Sure the signal was stronger after i installed the Range Expander , but it was less reliable do to all the dropped connections . And yes , I was using latest firmwarebit the bullet and ran wire directly to the room with the week signal and do not regret the effort . This product is not worth the time or money  
1	  This will be a perfect product for linking two of the similar products are to be links . Good for Office to Office connection . We have a few telecomuters who are using Mac and Windows XP and this was the worst purchase I have ever made . If any of the mobile users are using VoIP then just add a ton of issues to this . I am able to connect to my older LinkSys router with Linux , Mac , Windows ( all types )  
1	  The picture and title says 90 minute tape - but the description says 60 minute tape ! No wonder the price is so cheap - you were warned  
1	  I have only had this modem for a month . Now i have to unplug it and connot use the fax . It decided to start answering my phone without the receive fax option turned on . When plugged in i can't use my phone .  
1	  The picture quality is very bad and the camera feels cheap compared to Canon and Fuji brands . This is a camera for poor people who can't afford a good brand . I would stick with a Japanese brand camera .  
1	  I ordered two of these hoping to use them in tandem . One mic out of the box was doa . The other one did work , but had horrible hum and distortion when in use . Had to yell into the mic to get any output . I have other Pyle products and have been pleased with their performance . Not this one . Contacted Amazon for return and refund . Quick , easy , painless , no hassles . UPS came the next day with a return sticker . Got refund notice that day . I find Amazon has great customer interaction . I wish more companies took the time and and effort to please their customer base . Probably why I shop here instead of with those jokers .  
2	  The DV4500 is hands down the best money I have ever spent ! It has been trouble free and easy to use . Recording video and taking pictures is a one touch operation , and I love being able to take my MP3 's with me without a separate player . Using it on Windows XP is also as simple . I can even transfer the pics and video to my Mac . I read the review from the Guest in Norfolk . I beg to differ . Aiptek does not need to USB 1.1 Drivers on XP ! Windows provides the drivers . You only need drivers for the webcam mode to work . Check out $U$ for some help if you need it . Thanks for another sensational gadget Aiptek !  
2	  This is a top of the line point'n shoot camera . Without any doubt the 12x optical zoom with image stabilizing and fast 2.8f aperture along the whole zoom range of 35-420 mm ( 35mm equiv . ) are the icing on the cake . Nevertheless I 'm slightly dissapointed about this camera because the specs read like my dream camera and the engineers from Panasonic just couldn't keep it together . Why ? - I will cover this later . I was so anxious about getting my set together that I bought a bag first going by the size of the FZ1 - big mistake . The FZ10 is about double the size . Definitly no camera to slip in your pocket . Battery are pretty expensive , about 50 $ a piece . A good replacement , not from Panasonic but way cheaper and even higher in the mAh rating is AC-CGAS002 ( the barn were you get ` em from is great ) . Charge and running time equal almost 1hr . The Tripod adapter blocks access to the battery and memory compartment . In dcresource the macro is described to work only in the automatic macro mode . So you couldn ` t go by your own settings ( manual ) . Good news - not true - . What is also not described in the manual , the camera does the same macro in manual mode . Literally up to the lense , almost touching it , with super sharp images . Personally , I do prefer the manual mode for several reasons and this is where my dissapointment starts . In a dim light situation , still enough to take a decent picture , the LCD is pitch black . It is not broken , that 's just the way it is . The techs from Panasonic told me something about achery techniques and how to shoot over the body . I call it a " Misconception " . Also the brightness of the flash is not displayed , saying the LCD should get brighter when flash is activated . Still you get nice pictures - with dim light focusing slightly advanced to some other digital pointers - just you don't see the composition and focusing . I consider this the major drawback of this camera . Surprisingly enough though , if you switch to Automatic mode the LCD display in the very same dim light situation with exactly the same setting , is fine . Aperture - or Shutter priority are also good in this respect . I say it again , this applies only to dim light situations in manual mode . In standard light situations you won't notice . Talking about low light situations , the flash is quite impressiv . Gives you also the option to compensate ( -2 / + 2 ) . This is very helpful if you don't wanna compensate the flash by shutter / aperture . Lense cap has no string to hold it to the body - risk of losing it . I am an avid Photoshop user . So I like the auto braket function to take 3 consecutive shots with different esposures for different layers in the software . Still after every shot you have to kick the bracket in again . There is no button to enable this function permanently like cameras for only a fraction of the price do . I wouldn't mind that if it were not so long winded to get to that function . Between changing the shutter / aperture in Manual mode , engaging the bracket to -1 / + 1 and back again , it is necessary to push 9 buttons . ( Wanna count ? exposure / dial up / 3x dial right / 3xdial up / exposure . ) And this after every shot , huhh . Most people won't mind , but it takes only jpeg format . No non-compression formats available . This camera lets me take considerably more pictures ( about 165 ) with 256mb than my Dimage s414 ( about 125 ) , which also happens to be a 4 MP camera - each camera in the best jpeg settings . With best settings this camera takes file sizes wich average about 1,5MB ( Dimage S414 about 2MB ) . OK not every manufacture uses compression to the same extend , and in this setting Panasonic has surely found a nice compromise between quality and compression . Still I would be happier if Panasonic had tweaked its compession less aggressively , in order to achieve higher quality ( but lager file size ) . Expecially since non-compression is missing and this camera is supposingly more oriented towards the prosumer section . Nevertheless the picture quality is superb across the whole zoom range ( the lense seems to make up for it ) . I read reviews were people complained about noise . I figure they chose the wrong ISO ( Auto ISO ? ) . Try to use 100 , 50 if possible . Everything from ISO 200 on gets indeed noisy , so is it with other cameras . And the fast lense 2.8f over the whole zoom range together with the Image Stabilizer give you quite some options here . The image stabilizer works great . I think this feature should become as much of an standard as it is for camcorders . This from Panasonic should be a wake up call for the other manufactures to install it in there ultrazooms . Very positive is the overall speed of the camera . SD memory might help it . Run-up , Burst mode and time between shots is very fast . High Burst gets you 4-5 shots in 2sec . After that you are ready again after about 4 sec . I consider this to be very fast . The only issue in the Burst mode is that it freezes the picture in the LCD screen . Burst makes sense for moving objects . And that is were you find it almost impossible to keep your object in focus when you just see a series of taken pictures with a delay of about 0.5 seconds . The purple fringing , which often comes along with extreme zoom lenses seems to be moderate . I haven't seen any so far with taken lots of pictures in situations where this is supposed to be most present , like against the sun with darker objects in front . Still it is mentioned in some of the reviews . Verdict : Even thought I wrote critically this shouldn ` t distract from the fact that this is a state of the art point'n shoot camera with a great Leica lense and a stabilazation system you won't find in any other model of this category . So giving away some of my high expectations this is still an excellent camera which will epeal to the advanced photographer with a need for an extreme zoom .  
2	  I like this receiver very much . It has back panel conveniece outlets ( 100 watt unswitched ) , a tape monitor loop switch , and mutes the sound briefly when switching inputs for reliability . I believe other comments concerning reliability and hiss are just unfortunate occurances in an otherwise well built reliable unit , and are not typical of the unit that you would probably receive . Its ' best feature is the sound which is very listenable and musical allowing one to enjoy the sound for hours without interruption . It is a bit bass-shy in the lower octives when compared to receivers fron Onkyo and Yamaha and does not have a low inpedance design . I can't comment on the competition in this price range but do feel it is an excellent value and that you really wouldn't go amiss purchasing this unit . Overall , 5 stars .  
1	  Like another reviewer mine went bad in far too short of a time . There 's really no excuse for it . Of course there is only a one year warranty , and the folks at lynksys wouldn't even give me a price break on a replacement . So I think I 'll be going elsewhere this time .  
1	  I bought my A75 to replace my aging Espon PhotoPC650 , which has served me well for the last four years . The camera 's pretty good , but .. Six weeks later , halfway through our family vacation , the A75 died with the e18 error . I changed the CF card in our hotel room , turned it on to check how many photos were available , turned the camera off . Ten minutes later at the restaurant , the camera wouldn't turn on . E18 on the display . Returned from vacation , sent it back . First warning sign - be suspicious of any company that doesn't have a Return Number Policy . When I called the factory service center to check on my status five days after they received it ( according to FedEx ) , it wasn't checked in . I asked to speak to a supervisor , was told she was busy and would call me back . Three hours later , no call back , so I tried again . Not only was my unit not checked in yet , I was told that they had 24 hours to call me back . Now that they 've finally checked it in , it 's going to be up to 14 business days before they send it back to me . As someone who used to run a warranty service center for a national company , I find Canon 's repair and return policies disturbing , and their turn-around time laughable . Returns should be checked in same day they are received , customers should have their calls returned the same day , and barring unusual circumstances , no repair should be in house for more than 10 days . This was my first , and now probably my last Canon product .  
2	  Stereo , works , hasn't broken yet after a couple months like others usually do . What else can I say ? I need eleven words .  
1	  The reviews statistically tell how this product is - useless . I think the designers and manufacturer need to recall every single unit in the market and realize it doesn't work . Strangely enough , they still claim it works . How that is possible is beyond me . I purchased this due to curiosity but turned out 99 % of the reviewers are right . Splitting signal from my PS3 to 2 HDTV screens did not work . I then purchased a powered HDMI splitter from Game Infinity ( $U$ and was extremely satisfied with it . I can have my PS3 display on 2 or 1 screen beautifully and it 's about the size of my HTC Fuze . The splitting is done automatically by detecting the signal from the source .  
1	  This is a cheap version of something better . It took hours to recharge the battery even a little . We went back to using the chord that came with the iPod that plugged into the computer ( via USB ) . I believe this to be a cheap foreign imitation . Spend the extra littel bit of money and buy the proper chord .  
2	  When buying a laptop sleeve I was deciding between hand made original sleeve made of fabric and neoprene sleeve and this one won . I liked the looks and nature of hand made sleeve better but this is better fit for the purpose - protection for occasional travels . It is robust , especially the area around the zip . Sometimes I miss a handle or adapter compartment but otherwise I 've been satisfied . One thing to be aware of - this sleeve will not protect the laptop from sharp objects since it can be easily punctured .  
2	  This product has realy good sound , great non skip technology , especially when driving in a car or truck over rough terrain or even while walking or jogging . I don't recommend the car kit cassette adaptor , so don't buy this with the car kit included . Use the SONY adaptor , much .. more reliable .  
1	  Good sound quality , but I found them very cumbersome to put on and were somewhat uncomfortable while wearing . Discontinued using them and bought another pair .  
1	  I purchased this system several years ago and have enjoyed viewing DVD 's on this system . Until recently I never bothered to run my cable box ( HDTV ) through it , mostly due to the fact that I thought I was doing something wrong when trying configure the system . I could never get it to work . I have now learned that my sytem will not play ANY external devices . Now , I 'm going to have to pay for service on this system that probably never worked correctly out of the box .  
2	  This little i-pod has on it the entirity of my i-tunes library WITH space to spare .. and that is about 60 full length opera 's ! The amount of music that fits on this device is unbelievable , and the quality of sound is immeasurable . The video capabilities are also incredible . I highly recommend this product ..  
2	  I have a Canon Digital Rebel EOS . The XSi one . I have the standard kit lense - EFS 18-55mm , ) . 25m / 0.8ft , 58mm . I lost the lens cap on a hike and so purchased this as a replacement . It fits perfect , no problem .  
1	  Everything worked fine for about a week , then it stopped playing burned CDs , then all CDs , then the radio stopped picking up stations . Works great as an alarm clock , but then why not just buy a ceap alarm clock ? Definitely wouldn't recommend this product to anyone .  
2	  Simple to setup , and very simple to use . It provides a good & # 34 ; typing & # 34 ; angle , and it keeps the laptop cooler temperature wise . No user issues .  
1	  This is not a multi coated filter . Using this on your lens makes the picture quality come down by 2 notches . If any direct sunlight hits the glass ( even if the sun is not withing the picture frame ) , the whole picture appears washed out . I only bought this because I got this free with my lens purchase . I always buy the sigma multicoated filters for my lenses . They are truely multi coated and reflect a dim green just like the expensive camera lenses . Unfortunately tiffen does not make any true multi coated lenses .

1	  It was a great camera .. it took great quality photos . the the flash sometimes dosent work to well . After a few weeks it stoped working all together - it wouldnt turn on or anything . my advise - get a different camera even if costs a little more .  
2	  When THE LITTLE FRIEND opens , Harriet Dufresnes , the heroine of this large novel , is only six months old . It is then that her nine year old brother Robin is found murdered in the family yard . After this disturbing introduction , we flash forward twelve years . Robin 's murder has never been solved . Harriet 's family is fractured beyond repair , with a mother almost constantly tranquilized and an older sister who does her best to make herself invisible . Although Harriet may not have known her older brother and may not even realize what a normally functioning family would be like , she recognizes that her family is not it . And so , at the age of twelve , Harriet decides to track down Robin 's killer . Her suspicion falls upon one Danny Ratliff , even though there is no real reason to suspect him other than the fact that he is generally not the nicest person around and comes from a family even more rotten . Of course it is unrealistic to expect Harriet to be successful in her endeavor . She is , after all , a kid on a murder trail long since gone cold and looking for the killer that trained lawmen could not find . Rather , Harriet 's hunt is the plot device by which the author Donna Tarrt explores Southern life circa the 1970s in an extremely well written and wonderfully drawn narrative . THE LITTLE FRIEND can be construed as being what Tom Wolfe refers to as the realistic novel , in which a fictitious tale is used to illuminate an accurate slice of American life . That Americana covers some interesting ground . A grossly fractured and dysfunctional family , race relations between white employers and their black employees , poor white Southern culture , the unique religiosity of the South , all provide fertile ground for Tarrt 's wonderful writing . The best aspect of the book , however , is Tarrt 's portrait of Harriet herself , who is one of the best drawn and most interesting characters in fiction one is likely to come across . Tartt captures a twelve year old 's thoughts and emotions as her view of the world becomes less nave to certain realities with near perfect pitch . And Harriet has just the right amount of precociousness to make her ideal . As one example , Harriet is mischievous enough to forge the hand writing of her goody-two-shoes classmate into a love letter to the Sunday school teacher , but mature enough not to actually send it . Such a proper balancing of characters ' personalities is evident throughout the novel . Some may complain that the ending of THE LITTLE FRIEND is not only unresolved but too empty to be satisfying . I think , though , that such an interpretation misses the point . This is Harriet 's journey through a certain point in her life . Not all of life 's adventures end with a proper and clear resolution and the book 's ending reflects this . Readers had to wait ten years after publication of Donna Tartt 's first novel for this follow up . In my opinion , it was worth the wait .  
2	  Nice ! Item shipped right away . It works really well . Doesnt work with all dj softwares though . overall pretty good . great item .  
1	  I love the keyboard , the design is great and the battery life is exceptional . Its sleek and modern looking and has been very sturdy and reliable ( owned about 5 months ) . I would have thought customer support from a giant like logitech would have been on par with the great product - Not so . I recently moved and the power adapter for the keyboard dock was misplaced / lost in the process leaving no way to recharge the keyboard . I contacted logitech support and after some delay they replied to me .. They cant offer me a way to buy a replacement power pack , but hey they will give me a discount if I want to buy another keyboard .. WTF ? Below is the email I received Logitech , I replied telling them that did not help me and requesting further assitance so I didnt have a 160 $ paper weight .. - Thats was over a month ago with no word back from them . Dear John , Thank you for contacting Logitech Customer Care . My name is Arl , and I 'm happy to assist you with your concern . This is your case number : 110817-0xx . I noticed that you had submitted your email to us on 08/16/11 . I want to take a moment to apologize for the wait in receiving my response and thank you for your patience . John , as I understand , you need a new power cable for your keyboard . Apparently , we don't have the spare power cable . I apologize for the inconvenience . Logitech values you as a loyal customer and as a gesture of goodwill , I can provide you with a Loyalty Discount code . The Loyalty Discount code will allow you to place one order on the Logitech . com online store ( [ .. ] ) with a discount of 35 % .

Would you be interested in receiving a Loyalty Discount code ?  
2	  My first impresion was that the amplifier / receiver unit is very well built ; it is heavy and has the kind of design that you get for an expensive system . The speakers do not look as elegant but not disappointing . But the subwoofer begs for a major improvement for its aesthetic appearance ; it looked just big and unpolished . For movies and pop music , it offers excellent sound from the speakers . Again , the subwoofer did not quite meet my expectation . It lacks the punch as it 's not a powered unit . The low frequency sound was loud but loose . I heard much ' mumbling ' but not enough ' boom ' . For classical music , it'a a mixed bag . Solo instrument performance such as the violin , cello or piano , sounds good . But for symphonic works , the system simply can not handle the complex mixture of sound . My feeling is that there is not enough ' bandwidth ' to accommodate the sound . Picture quality is great . The only problems were with SVCD at the last few minutes on the disc . Perhaps the laser can not pick up overburnt region . Overall , I would say the system is worth the money , $ 250 . You get a lot of functions for this compact system .  
2	  I bought this years ago and back when i needed this it worked pretty well . Only problem was that sometimes I had to restart my laptop when I popped it out in order for it to work again . But overall , it worked well .  
1	  I originally bought this camcorder because I liked the idea of mini-DVD storage and I liked my old analog Sony camcorder . It is not the same Sony . First of all , the camera is terrible at focusing on anything closer than 10 ' away .. if the target is moving , forget about it . Second , you get a message on the screen if you dare use a non-Sony mini-DVD disk . Third , I bought a ' compatable ' Energizer battery and it will not charge it . Why must Sony try and wring every nickel out of its customers ? My biggest beef is the way they try and disguise the fact that you CAN edit the image using non-Sony software , but it took me a couple of hours of surfing and another hour of experimentation to find out how . You can format the disk one of two ways , and you need to use VR formatting to get to the program . Do NOT finalize the disk first , or you will never be able to access it . Sony then disguises the fact that one of the files in an mpeg by simply changing the extension .. so change it back . Then you can bring it into any editor that has an mpeg codec . Hey Sony , am I giving away your trade secrets ? Well , take me to court !  
2	  I am very pleased with the 670 . It is working great with all my devices which includeCox Cable DCT-6400 PVRSamsung 61 " DLPYamaha receiverSamsung DVD playerJVC VCRRoku Music ServerLike it says , it is really made for PVR devices . I haven't found a function it doesn't support . Keys are laid out nice and easy to use .  
1	  I found that the SD500 fits snugly in the original Pentax PTX-L40 case , as offered by J & R. On the Pentax site they show a different case for the L40 , maybe they changed it , but the one shown at J & R is the one I tried - and it has a small pocket for an extra battery and memory card .  
2	  I 've had bad luck with mouse purchases over the past few years . My husband ( who is an IT person , not me ) would do adjustments to the drivers , but even so my mouse would tend to still feel " sticky " in its action , and the roller that allows you to scroll down the page would sometimes jam up , too . Not so with this mouse . It 's smooth and easy to use .  
1	  I love the way you can easily access / change DVDs with the flip-top style of player . And we hooked up my daughter 's V-Smile with no problem . HOWEVER , within 30 days of purchase , the little tab that holds the cover shut had broken . I contacted customer service and sent it back for repair . Within 2 weeks , the OTHER player began to malfunction . A few emails were sent back and forth , and finally I discovered that if I used masking tape to hold the cover shut , the machine would play . I called to check on the other unit as I was told it would take 4-6 weeks for repair , and it had been at least 6 weeks at that point . The agent had no record of my unit being returned . When I gave him the tracking number I sent the package with , he said that it had made it to one location , but that location had not forwarded it to their repair location , and that he would ship me a new unit , which would arrive in about a week . It 's been almost 3 weeks and I still don't have anything back from the company . When I try to call , the number stays busy . They are no longer answering my emails . I never sent in the second unit for repair , and I 'm glad I didn't . When it worked , the machine was nice , but it didn't work long enough for the price . I still have my Coby unit , and though it 's a pain to change DVDs , at least it still works more than a year later ! I will NEVER buy ANYTHING from Venturer EVER again !  
1	  The first couple of months we loved this player and loaded our whole CD collection onto it . In month eight , the player battery would no longer charge with an AC or car adapter . We drained the first battery and bought a new battery . While trying the various suggestions from the Creative Help Lab , the second battery also failed to charge . I haven't found the help lab all that " helpful , " either .. mainly an overall lack of understanding the problem we stated and the troubleshooting measures we had already taken .  
1	  I purchased the camcorder for family events etc . The video quality is good , get what you pay for , but the still picture quality is / was horrible ( @ . 39 ) ! I took the camcorder back to Best Buy and will continue to look for a good zoom , high quality still & video CCD .  
1	  If the author of the above blurb would indicate the I / F ( USB , parallel or SCSI ) that this thing uses it would sure help making a purchase decision !  
2	  Like so many others that use it ; I love this stuff ! Used it for a new cooler I bought ( Zalman 9900MAX ) on a phenom II Hex-core over clocked to 4.0ghz with other variables over clocked to a far reaching extent . Cool temperatures idle and full load . I have reviewed the 9900MAX so feel free to look up my review of it as it goes into depth on temp and such with my setup . Pro 's : competitively pricedEffective heat desperationGood for more than one useCon 's : NoneOther thought 's : I used the dot method with the application  
1	  I needed a replacement for a stock 5.25 inch mid-bass speaker for the front kick panel enclosure , nothing fancy . I am using my stock head unit , pushing no more than 30watts . This Pyramid speaker was absolutely horrible ! The specs for the frequency response ( down to 60Hz ) and sensitivity ( 92db ) were a joke . The volume from this speaker was non-existant until I cranked it up to about 1/2 way , at which time I could barely hear muddy bass and hollow mid-range . Crank it up to about 3/4 just to get it moderately loud , and everything was completely distorted .. The other stock speakers sounded loud and undistorted , but this Pyramid was so distorted and distracting that it made my 16yr old stock speakers sound like champs ! Just out of curiosity , I then hooked this speaker up to an old bookshelf system I have lying around and I ran some frequency tests on it using a DVD audio input . Sure enough , anything below 120Hz sounded like I was murdering it . The 1KHz-5KHz range seemed relatively clean , just needed to be louder . Bottom line - cheap speaker made in China with fudged specifications . It has good apparent external quality , and nice heft to the magnet , but that 's about it . May be a adequate replacement for a dedicated mid-range as long as you use cross-overs to keep out the frequencies it has no business even attempting ..  
1	  I purchased a ' renewed ' television from Philips Outlet . The purchase came with a 90 day warranty . Shortly after one month , the television began spontaneously turning off . I took the unit to an authorized repair shop as Philips directed . After 45 days and many phone calls , the repair shop returned the television and said it was fixed ; however , when I brought the TV home , it was not fixed and I experienced the same problems . I contacted Philips and the repair shop immediately . Following another month of the repair shop waiting on Philips for direction ( wondering if they should attempt a second repair or replace the unit ) and many more phone calls , I was recently told by Philips that my warranty had expired and they would no longer fix the problem ( even though the problem that occurred when it was under warranty was never fixed ) . When the TV works , it 's nice . But I want to warn others about Philips customer service . I 'll never buy from Philips again ..  
2	  I 'm almost positive I could have used a less intense form of SD card for my digital camera and been quite happy , but with the great reputation of SanDisk , the quick write time , and the unbelievable price ( $ 30 ) , buying this card was an easy choice .  
2	  Ok , so recently I stepped on my Earhugger A1000 Action Wrap Headphones . Unfortunately , they sounded good and fit really well . When I went back to BL they were all out . So I tried a pair of RPHS34 headphones by Panasonic ( my review didn't go through and don't feel like writing another one ) . They sound good and fit well but leaked way too much sound . So I ordered a pair of JVC earbuds on Amazon which I will review when they arrive . So on to these Koss P3 earbuds . I didn't buy them . These came with a set of big Koss headphones and since my friend can't stand earbuds , they passed these up to me . Hey , how can I pass down something that 's free ? Since they were really cheap and the reviews for these were bad I expected these to suck but really these are some good earbuds given the low price . I tried these on some of my music and sounded pretty good , not great but much better than others claim . Just with the EQ off these sounded good . The bass is actually pretty rich to me comparing the Sony MDRE828LP and the Earhugger A1000 . These don't provide near as much bass as those that cost much more but do sound good enough for their purchase . Mids sounded fine , But as with most of the cheaper earbuds I noticed a bit much in the 200-500k range . These also provide a good lcean sound to them , you don't hear fantastic detail but you can hear most of which comes out of your tunes . Overall , above average sound quality . Not excelling in anything but not failing in anything . I 've also heard that these are too big . Yes , they are larger than most , but with the provided pads on them they fit my rather SMALL ears just fine . These aren't for running or excercising , if you are looking for something on that matter you may want to pick up the Koss KSC22 or the Sony MDRJ10 . These don't fall out when walking but any vigorous activity will just not work with these headphones . One thing you MUST know is about the lifetime warranty . Yes , they come with the lifetime warranty . But unless you bought these in the pack with the big headphones , the warranty is pretty useless since you have ot send in five bucks to get them repair . Somewhat a ripoff if you look at the price listing for these seperately . Overall , a good middle of the road chose for those looking for somethnig with good sound and are comfortable and don't want to spend a ton . They are no where near the best headphones you can buy , nor are they the best sub ten , but for a cheap and well suitable replacement for your iPod or other portable player , these are it . 4 stars .  
1	  We know what they are and what they are for . I wish it was dollar for dollar instead of mind games with points . If you get burned buying content you are told to contact the company the released the content . When you contact the company they tell you to contact Microsoft for a credit because you paid them .. It 's all a trick ! But we sure do love our XBOX to take those chances . Enjoy !

1	  Nothing but problems , poor tech support and software that is notfriendly . There are many fine multipurpose printers out there , this is NOT one of them .  
1	  This camera really is a waterproof pocket camera , and it removes worries of rain , sand , mud , or other substances getting into the camera and ruining it . Its very carefree in that way . Unfortunately , it does such a lousy job of exposing , focusing , and capturing that in place of your worry about rain damage is your new worry about capturing that special moment . I love virtually everything about this camera .. except the lousy picture quality . The camera looks great , feels nice , is easy to use , starts up quickly , and is of course waterproof . It fits easily in a pocket and the battery lasts for a reasonably long period of time . It even comes with a nice padded belt case . But after you have seen the results , all you will be thinking about as you frame that next shot is if you 'll get home and discover the picture you just took is so bad its unusable . Outside of bright , direct sunlight , I would guess that 50 % of the images from this camera are sub-standard . And half of those are so bad they are unusable . If you can live with those odds and you need a pocket camera that is waterproff , then you will like this camera . I honestly have had better , more consistent shots from a 2MP Fuji camera from 2001 than I have with the Optio .  
2	  If you transfer a lot of files between computers than a flash-memory drive is absolutely essential . Students and teacher in particular ( or anyone else who needs to transfer a lot of files or make frequent backups ) will find these drives absolutely indespensible . Why go through the hassle of burning cds all the time ? Why go through the trouble of linking two machines just to transfer a few files ? It is quite likely that drives like this one will replace floppies in the very near future . Fast , easy to use , reliable , durable , and infinitely re-writable . What more could anyone ask for ? And especially since the price keeps dropping lower and lower ..  
2	  Darn it . I jinxed myself as soon as I posted my first review . A few days later , the rubber coating on one of the ear cords got split . My bad , I was just porting them in my pocket , not case so one got torn as I was pulling them out of the pocket . So the copper wires were exposed in all their fine glory and looking shiny and so scarily exposed . Solution : Liquid Electrical Tape ( home repair section ) . Toothpick again to coat the exposed section in thin layers and at least my cables have integrity again and I don't need to worry about the wires getting damaged . Work in a well ventilated area and don't let the drips get anywhere else . This is way better than shrink tubes / wrap or tape . whew .. Btw , I also tried out the Sport Modas . I would recommend you save for a Vibe but if you just need an entry level Vmoda , the lite Sport version costs much less but is also less comfortable . Good for audio books , airline movies . For music , stick with the Vibes . * Got gunmetal Vmodas after getting tired of spending $ on $ 20 headphones . While I enjoy the volume control or noise reduction on the low end phones , these are worth spending 3 cheap phones worth in one nice package . I use these for my Palm TX . Like some users , I 'd like to have a right angle jack instead since it gets difficult to fit the palm with 1 long spike into a pocket . I 'll let you read the other audiophile reviews for quality . I 'm just addressing some issues and workarounds . From the cheap versions to these , it is an improvement in quality . MP3s at 256kbs form AMazon MP3 downloads sound great . I 've redone my other files to 256 provided the source was high quality to begin with . For YouTube rips , the quality depends on the original file ( taking audio only ) . My . wav files sound good . I record biaurally and it 's just nice to reproduce sound 360 . They did sound way better after the so-calle burn process so I think people should listen to them first and compare again after the burn before rendering judgment . Also , you cannot compare $ 200 dollar phones to these . That 's just apples and oranges . I 've had them close to a year now and would get another backup pair ( different color ) when there is another good sale . I would stay away from the sports model ( looks similar and runs much less ) since the wires are much thinner ( 1/2 size ) and don't seem to be the same quality . Pros : good sound , portable , noise reducing , super comfortable medium fit , rubber cords ( not for everyone ) Cons : ear fittings slip off easily , cords have memory no matter how I wind them , long jack instead of right angle , metal surfaces ( static buildup but this is common to many head phones ) Workarounds :* Slippery fittings : 1 ) Replacements : Hie thee to vmoda . com and order replacements for your ear size , get 2 packs while you 're at it once you know which size fits you best . S / H included but sometimes stock is out so you should wait until your size is in stock before ordering . You would not believe the whining customers do in ordering out of stock items and then wondering why it hasn't arrived . Neither could Vmoda so they eliminated comments from the peanut galleries . Backup fittings are like a flat tire kit ( once you have one , no flats ) . I kept losing them in a few months and when I had a ready backup , didn't lose any for 8 months . You can designate clear for one side and black for the other if you need to distinguish R / L. 2 ) Making them stick : You can try attaching with some adhesive . I used a toothpick to apply a gnat / fairy size amount of Gorilla Glue to the edges and slipped the fitting over it . I would say use only 1 or 2 sides to dab first . REmember Gorilla Glue expands to twice it 's size upon drying . Keep away from pets . The peanut butter smell is a huge pet wanna wolf / munch / swallow it down attractant . The last thing you need is your Vmoda 's in Wolfie 's stomach . Others have used Superglue ( read instructions and warnings on package ) . I was also experimenting with Silicone caulk ( commonly found in home repair supplies ) . Good news : It doesn't come off ! Bad news : It doesn't come off ! : + ; I figure I 'll cross that bridge when I come to replacing fittings in a year . Be very careful not to get any glue on the speaker portion . You do this at YOUR OWN RISK and can practice on something else first . * Rubber cords : tacky and good grip . When I need more control , a clip to a collar and another clip to control slippage does well to keep the length where i want it . Not a big fan of metal wrapped cords since I get a lot of static buildup in carpeted offices . Outdoors , static build up is not an issue . The metal tips still zap but one gets accustomed to discharging the zap . * Carry pouch : doesn't really matter . I lost mine and replacements every few months . There are way more attractive pouches at your local street fair and ethnic / WorldMarket store for just a few bucks . * Noise Reduction : I think reduction is safer than isolation in urban / office environments . These reduce ambient noise to manageable levels but let you still be aware of your environment . Do wish there was a direct volume / mute control like there are on cheap sets but you can't get everything .  
2	  all 5 of my lenses are covered by B & W. i have enjoyed German made products for their sheer quality and if that 's you , then you will appreciate this relatively expensive filter . it feels so good as the brass of this filter meshes with that lovely latest lens , that you won't care . tell you what , get the cheapy and screw it on , and then replace it with a B & W. buy it from Amazon and you can effortlessly return the one that you don't like or think too expensive . if you like the best , this is it .  
2	  I 've used Amazon to order various items before and was always satisfied with the result .. quality at low prices . I ordered a Sony Dsc G1 on Sunday June 24th and it arrived Thursday , June 28th . I 've taken about 50 photos under critical conditions , low light and using the automatic features of the camera . I 'm amazed at how well it performs . Big LCD screen , the camera is a nice size for my big hands , just a little bigger then the regular Cybershots . The resolution in the screen is excellent . I was considering the DSC T-100 but it got such bad ratings that I went with this camera .. sure glad I did ! When I figure out some of the more technical features I 'll post a more detailed review .  
1	  There was no indication that this product would not work with Vista . I wanted to use it to send audio to my BT headset or to my BT receiver connected to my stereo . I 'm sure it works great with some other operating systems . Jabra Tech Support said to keep checking their web site for an update . After 3 months , there is still no sign of a Vista driver , even though many other products have been upgraded to support Vista .  
1	  this thing [ is bad ] . it 's one of the worst printers i 've ever dealt with . the on / off switch does basically nothing . to " reboot " the printer you have to unplug it from the wall . this has to happen often because it doesn't play nice with the computer so there are often errors during printing . it will not print pdf files on 8.5 " x11 " correctly . for some reason it scales the page so that it 's bigger than the paper so a bunch of stuff gets cut off . after printing about 25 pages in a 30 page job , with brand new ink cartridges , it said - suddenly - i can't find the print heads . please install new print heads . we haven't even come close to 10000 pages ( which is supposed to be the life of the print head ) . the print heads are in there . i followed recommended cleaning techniques from the web - tap the print head 20-30 times on a wet towel . i removed and reinstalled the inkcartidges about 100 times . all to no avail . the printer just keeps flashing red ( " fast flashing " which means there is no ink or no print head installed which is completely false ) . i tried switching from mac to windows . no better . the windows driver software ( from Xerox ) doesn't know how to handle the printer in an error state , so when you try to get the status - hoping to run head cleaners or something - it just crashes - lowlevel windows crashes . ack . i hate it . i 'm going to throw the hunk of junk out the window into the street right now .  
2	  Just installed the router in a few minutes and has been working great since then . I would definitely buy it again .  
2	  Obviously a terrific price , but since you usually get what you pay for I was a bit skeptical . I was also eager for a good deal and I know that Amazon stands behind its third-party sellers with an excellent buyer protection program . So I placed an order . The shipment arrived several days EARLIER than expected , with the right number of items , in the right color mix . Good so far . I was expecting the packaging to look pretty much like " real " cartridges , or for it to list my printer model . While the black cartridges did this , the color cartridges listed lots of models , but NOT mine . Also , the protective plastic cap looked very different . I had several worried moments until I unwrapped one cartridge , prepped it for installation , and compared it to the Canon cartridge from my printer . They were IDENTICAL ! I popped the new cartridge into the printer and it worked beautifully . The inks mixed well , the color saturation was even , the hue was correct .. it 's a great cartridge , at a splendid price . I recommend these cartridges .. and this vendor .. with enthusiasm . Just don't be put off when the packages you get don't ( at first ) look like what you 've been using .  
2	  About 5 months ago my own Dell laptop up and died ( thank goodness for that ) so I finally had an excuse to buy a new computer . I had been seriously looking at the Mac for about a year , and now I had an excuse to get one . I bought the 15 " Powerbook G4 , and honestly , I don't think I 'll ever be going back . Perhaps the best place to start would be in terms of security . Macs are inherently more secure than Windows machines . You could say this is because no one uses the Mac , so all the hackers and script kiddies don't bother with them , or just because the Mac is better . It doesn't matter , because either way the statement is still true . Since I got a Mac , I completely forgot about viruses , worms , trojans , et al. I can check my email in peace , without worrying about the consequences . I don't have to put out extra money to pay for anti-virus software ( even though I did at first , just to be safe . I 've since found it to be unnecessary . ) I don't need to worry about emailing a killer virus to my entire address book and then having my credit card info mailed off to the Russian Mob . Or whatever . It 's just safer over here . Ease of use is the next big area . Once you get to know the Mac ( took me about one afternoon before I could comfortably move around it ) you find that everything is so much easier . The statement " Everything just works " is so true , although for a non-user , it is sort of hard to explain . I guess a good example of this would be my printer . For my Dell laptop , if I ever had to reinstall the drivers for the printer , I 'd have to go to HP 's website , download a 50MB file , then go through the whole installation process ( which seemed to screw up half the time anyway ) before I could print anything . With the Mac , I just had to plug the printer in , and OS X immediately recognized it and set it up for me . To add to the impressiveness of this , all the necessary utilities and controls were there , just as if I had gone to HP 's website and downloaded that stupid 50MB file . If you 're planning on getting the Powerbook specifically , I 'll give you some of the advantages of the mobile Mac over one of the various Windows bricks you could get . At only an inch thick and 5.7 pounds , it is incredibly light compared to a Windows laptop of similar screen size and processing power . I 'm a high school student right now , so carrying around a laptop in addition to the regular books and such can get make things pretty cumbersome . With the Dell laptop , it was like throwing a brick into my backpack . With the Powerbook , it 's definitely still there , but it also definitely weighs a lot less . The battery life on the Mac is also quite good , with 3 hours being about the average , and 4 hours if you really know how to conserve battery ( dim the screen , shut off Airport and Bluetooth , mute the sound . ) You should almost always have enough battery to watch a full length DVD . I don't know if this concerns you , but wireless range with Macs also seems to be considerably better . I have a wireless network at my home and at school , and the Powerbook gets a much better reception all around than the Dell Inspiron ever did . Lastly , there 's the coolness factor . I 've never met anyone who didn't stop to stare at a Powerbook , just to absorb the whole sight in . It 's a design marvel of sorts , there really isn't much to complain about . Aluminum is a very nice touch as well . The backlit keyboard rocks if you do anything in the dark .  
2	  There 's not much to say . It 's a battery . It works as you would expect . A great buy for the price .  
1	  Ok , so we got this camera about 3 years ago and paid $ 150-ish . We take pictures once maybe twice a year ( and NO more than a 100 total so far ) . Well I needed it for a school project tomorrow and guess what .. it 's dead ! It will let me look at the pictures I took three months ago , but nothing else .. it instantly shuts right back off . Better yet , after an hour of internet research , apparently several people have had this problem .. so I dug out my old SONY camera . It took two good pictures and then the picture / video card fried ! It literally started trembling in my hand . I 'm done with Sony .. last month our two year old Sony DVD player died too . This used to be the best quality company around , now they 've obviously turned to crap .  
1	  My choice of this item was my fault . I knew the product was no long being widely sold and the model I selected was out of date and technical assistance was no longer being offered by the company , which is now HP . Also , I had not noticed that the product was primarily for PCs and I have a MAC . The sellers were very gracious about accepting my return , fortunately .  
2	  Product was as described and worked fine . Company was nice to work with . I would buy from them again . Shipping was fast and the price was good .  
2	  The 190XPROB tripod are great simple aluminum sticks . Light enough for me . Strong , steady and firm . The best part of this tripod and what sets it apart from the rest is the ability to pull out the center column and fix it in a horizontal position enable many more tripod positions include straight down or over a wall . With this horizontal pole position , I will find a way to mount my neat little , but abled Lumix camera on the bar , along with my main camera on the Manfrotto ballhead .  
2	  I bought a pair of these for myself and later another pair for my wife . These headphones are of excellent quality and sound great . The noise canceling feature is perfect for listening to music on long plane trips . Although a little big , they are quite comfortable and I think the over-the-ear design cuts out more noise than other headphones . I highly recommend these for anyone looking for some peace and quiet .  
1	  1 ) I need to buy heatsink retention2 ) Why motherboard on the picture is not the same as delivered motherboard ? ( less socket on the board for other boards )  
2	  Pleased with both Amazon and the TV . Delivery was prompt , professional and free ! Television is great . Nicest thing about it is that the engineers clearly put some thought into the user interface . It 's simple , intuitive , and elegant . Picture is wonderful , basic sound is a little better than expected . I looked at plasmas for about 2 months - this was the right choice .  
1	  i bought one of these dvd players and fell in love with letterbox eliminator and the excellent picture and sound it played several dvds well but then about aweek after owning it it started to severly skip on every dvd old or new so i had amazon send another once again after a few days it started skipping and theres no reason to pay more for a sony and thier ( [ precision drive 3 ) the sonys skipped even more ! i recently bought a zenith thin line dvd player for $ 50 bucks and so far so good its picture and sound is great and it hasnt skipped so aslong as it doesnt severly skip in the future im going to keep it but beware panasonic samsung sony all have 1 thing in common regardless of price they skip the sonys also are very loud and load slowly like an old pc you can count to 10 after hitting play on a sony before it loads then halfway through a movie it skips just like the others shame on sony for selling overpriced dvd players that work no better than a noname brand and shame on samsung for not correcting known problems and continuing to sell defective players on amazon and i wont even shame cybertron they make such awful dvd players i actually pity them lmao i guess when you work for 50 cents a year youre not exactly happy at the factory and the result is a dvd player thats reliable as a square tire ok even at 10 dollars i couldnt recommend the cybertron cause you would have a 10 dollar non working metal box and trying to find customer support for cybertron is like trying to freakin find hoffa ok now lets hope the zenith keeps working well  
2	  This dual deck recorder makes nice recordings . It is far easier to use than most dual decks because of the " easy guider system " thus making copying a snap . A real bargin at a very fair price .  
2	  This is a nice little product . It pretty much does what it says it does and gives you a significant range boost over a standard wireless card . It will frequently expose networks that you can't even see with your normal card , and it will allow you to achieve a stable connections to networks that your normal card can see but not connect to . The software it came with performs fine , although there is no reason you can't just install the driver and use Windows to connect . I prefer the Hawking software since it shows a network 's connection strength as a percent rather than just bars . My only real complaint with this product and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that its not easily transportable . As other reviewers have mentioned the dish does not fold down so it would be pretty easy to break during transport . Your best bet is to keep the original box which will pack it securely , but thats takes up a lot of room in a suitcase so its not very practicle for trips . Bottom line , if you want something for stationary / local use this is a great product , but if you 're looking for something you can travel with you would be better off with something a little more compact .  
2	  Works great ! Sometimes I don't even have to hit the " connect " button to link it up . It even works on my Asus Eee Linux based PC .  
1	  Well I spent too much time doing this to be quite disappointed . I decided an online purchase would be quicker than the 5 minute drive to wal-mart . Then after I made my purchase they decided to tell me , Oh .. well this may take up to 4 hours to process . BOO !  
1	  I got this based on the high marks but I 'm not impressed with its ' performance . I think that some of the reviews are off-base . The application software is not that well designed ; it is not intuitive to navigate ( at least for me ) . Simple features you would expect from an application don't work like copy ( using ctl + c ) and paste ( using ctl + v ) . I 'm surprised that no label templates are provided for Microsoft word . The hardware is also not well-designed . It fails to print for no obvious reason with no debug information . It also mangles labels that do print by pulling up label separators during the printing process . Dymo technical support was not helpful ; I used their website chat support and they were not able to help me make the printer work . I 'd like to think that as an engineer , I 'm fairly savvy about how things work , but I have not able to get the printer to perform well . I would not recommend this label printer .  
1	  I returned the item within 5 minutes after I opened the box . It 's such a defect item that the glass is almost falling off from the unit . This is a very very poor quality product . It 's obvious that neither the manufacture nor the seller ( in this case amazon . com ) cares about their brand and reputation . I 'm very disappointed in amazon . com .  
2	  I bought this over 1/2 year ago & it still looks like new , even with almost daily use . Construction is sturdy & compact-the perfect size for any earbuds . As quality a product as Jlab 's Jbud 's , which also work flawlessly after a 1/2 year of tugs , pulls & usage .  
2	  The box has shown itself to work well for photos taken with my 5MP digital snapshot camera ( nothing fancy ) using a combination of the provided lights and the built-in flash . It took some playing around with light position to make sure no shadows . But , once I did , the pictures were really clean with night color and light balance . An extra light would help for some bigger items , but I used a task light for that , and it worked fine ( the color is not the same as the halogens , but since I was using for behind the object , it made no difference ) . The whole thing folds up and the lights fit into a pouch . This is useful for storage and carrying . The backdrop can be reversed to get two possible colors . The backdrop cloth is heavy duty and looks good in the picture ( no blotches ) . It drapes well , which is important . I think this works as well as the far more expensive ones of the same size . Only word of advice : check the size and what you will be photographing . I found some items were too big .  
1	  I expected better sound quality . I expected simple and easy . The sound quality is okay . I rate it fair . Simple and easy . It is simple to put the ipod in the docking station and it is easy to insert the cord into the ipod . However , the picture does not show this little cord that goes into the top of the ipod . Makes one think that you just sit the ipod in the docking station and it is done . The volume control doesn't work well . I have to turn up th volume on the ipod , then turn the volume up on the docking station . Its okay . I use it in my bedroom . Its not that attractive and it plays songs . I would not recommend it and I will not buy another one .  
2	  Solid construction and all the basics . Easy set up for the most part ( I had trouble only with setting up the safety stop ) . The optics are fine for home use , and it 's easy to use . The small set of prepared slides was a very nice surprise . Only two things would make it a little more user-friendly : coarse and fine focus adjustments on the same dial ( similar to the stage adjustment ) , and a switch on the light source . Overall I would definitely recommend this for the hobbyist ; it 's a great value for the price .  
2	  Great quality positive and negative scans . Very speedy . Very well built . Only draw back is you have to exchange the top everytime you want to scan slides .  
2	  I was so mad at myself when i scratched the face of my iphone with my engagement ring . It was a pretty deep scratch that was about 1/3 of an inch wide . I thought I would never get it out ! I searched online for ipod scratch remover and found idrops , I thought I would give it a try but had no big expectations . I started with an old cotton shirt and followed the directions exactly . After an hour , I started seeing some results but my thumb was starting to blister - then I switched to Q-tips . Best idea ever ! After about another 60 minutes ( and a few dozen Q-tips ) the scratch was just about gone . I worked on it a little bit over the next few days with Q-tips and the scratch is now gone ! My boyfriend thought I got a new phone ! It took a lot of work , and a lot of Q-tips - but my idrops purchase was well worth it !  
2	  This remote is great . Setting it up on the computer is much easier than making it learn via IR signals , and it has worked great . There are only two problems : 1 . My roommates don't quite seem to understand how to use it , and they keep going to the " Devices " menu and choosing the individual components of the system to control - effectively picking up another remote . 2 . It seems to set the wrong input on the TV when switching between activities . This could be my fault , and I 'm going to try to fix it by reprogramming it . For reference , the TV is a Samsung and only allows you to cycle through the inputs .  
1	  As others mentioned , this item may not work for you . It didn't work for me , though I have fairly modern equipment on both ends that I hooked this up to . It doesn't come with an explanation of the six toggle pins on it , either .  
1	  My boss and I both purchased this keyboard about 5 months ago and I am already on here shopping for a new keyboard .. I loved the design of this keyboard and have enjoyed using it , but some of the keys have quit working for no apparent reason .. We popped the keys off to see if something had fallen under the key and to see if something had been spilt on it , but nothing was apparent .. My boss has also had problems with hers .. After about 3 months of use the lettering on the keys started wearing off .. To sum up , the design of the keyboard is awesome , but the quality of this product is pathetic ..  
1	  Beware of this product . I used this with their Pec-Pad on my Kodak VC400 120 film . It was just regular film but left a streak when it dried . I try to wipe it off with the cleaner but every time it dries , it leaves a streak so its pretty much on there permanently .  
1	  To be fair , I haven't relentlessly pursued this vendor to force them to provide a solution . But that 's not my responsibility or job , its just my problem now that the vendor has both the product and the money . The email from Amazon requesting a review of the product was what triggered this review . I was going to investigate the situation next week , but this request for review arrived first . I thought this would be easier . I 'm sure it 's just a simple breakdown in communications that can easily be fixed . Here 's what 's happened so far .. 1 . Product arrived , but it was wrong product . 2 . Called vendor about problem and they asked I return product and then they 'd ship correct one after receiving this one . 3 . Returned product as per vendor 's instructions using their UPS label . 4 . According to UPS trace , product arrived at vendor destination . 5 . Silence . 6 . Silence . 7 . Silence . 8 . Emailed vendor 4 nights ago to ask when the correct product is going to ship . 9 . Silence . 9 . Silence . 10 . Silence . 11 . Amazon sends me a link to review the product . 12 . I write the review . 13 . Then I wait .. Amazon : If you could have the vendor verify that they are shipping the correct product and provide a tracking number , I would be grateful . ThanksBill  
2	  These do sound good , but not better than I expecter for $ 90 . I had to get 2 rca extentions for my L shaped desk , 5ft each . and I thought it had a plug for an ipod connection , but it does not . It could be hooked to one , but not without disconnecting it from the computer .  
2	  Perfect fit for the Canon G7 digital camera .. but then again .. it was created for it .. You should get one !  
2	  This keyboard combo actually works better than most other wireless keyboard / mouse combos I have tried at any price . At the low price I paid , an amazing value . Highly recommended .  
2	  It works , it 's fast . It was delivered on time . What else can I say ?  
2	  I got this for my fiance for work because other thermos never seemed to keep his coffee warm during a 16 hr day this one keeps coffee hot / warm for almost 2 days . He absolutely loves it thank you !  
1	  I wish I would of done a bit of research on external hard drives before this purchase . My drive would not light or startup after 4 days of use . Don't take my word for it .. Just look at the hundreds of posts on forums and bogs regarding the " My Book " line of WD drives and you will see how widespread the issues / failures are . It 's ridiculous .  
1	  As a previous poster already stated this unit only supports up to 2GB SD cards . Unless Philips releases a firmware update for SDHC cards or you have a large supply of 2GB or less SD cards stay away from this unit . Other than this major shortcoming , it 's a pretty good device .  
1	  Waste of money . Put what you would spend on this coverage and put it into a savings account for 2 years and only spend it if whatever you are covering breaks outside of the 1-year manufacturer 's warranty . Chances are you 'll never spend that money because most major electronics will last longer than the coverage period .  
2	  Great stand for the price , works very well with my ipad 2 . I am suggesting it to all my friends .  
2	  Got these to replace the sad stock speakers in my sound bar for my ' 97 Wrangler . They 're holding up so far but I didn't notice any improvement from the stock system at all . It would probably be worth it to spend a little more for something that will make a difference . I got another pair of the 4x6 pyle speakers and one of them was crackling within 2 days .  
2	  I just love this little camera . I 've always loved things in miniature and this lovely little thing takes wonderful pics .  
2	  Holy smokes I only paid $ 49 for this thing after rebates and it was worth a lot more . It is quiet , fast , prints on both sides of the paper , has two paper trays , and seperate less expensive ink tanks . I like the screen monitor that pops up showing the print progress and graphic representations of the ink remaining in each tank . I also have two HP printers in the house but the single color cartridges are SO expensive and if you run out of one color you have to replace the whole color cartridge . This has now become our primary printer and it just does a great job . It sure is handy to have 8 x 10 sheets in the top feeder and 4 x 6 glossy photo stock in the lower cassette feeder . I can print without changing paper type from anywhere in the house . I use this printer for normal 8 x 10 hardcopy , and for quick access photos . However my bulk photo printouts still go to CostCo where the quality is still better than the printer , and the cost is less . CostCo only charges $ 0.17 for 4 x 6 prints and by my calculation they cost over $ 0.22 on the PIXMA ip3000 .  
1	  I bought it to listen to audio books and it is so full of noise you can barely understand the words . It is also so distorted that the narrator sounds like a completely different person . It may just be my particular one , but it is not worth trying another .  
1	  D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigbit Wireless Router does not provide any better performance than an entry level Linksys ; do not waste your money on this product .  
1	  The battery works fine however , everyday I get a message that lets me know this is not a genuine Lenovo battery . When I purchased this product I thought it was a genuine Lenovo product . If the battery that I already had wasn't totally dead I would have tried to return it .  
2	  This cord works perfectly . It is a great deal for the price . It provides great data transfer speed for a low cost .  
2	  I bought this cartridge because black was the first to deplete in my 5 cartridge system . The swap was easy and fast and the printer immediately responded with better quality black printing .  
2	  This is one of my favorite books by one of my favorite authors . Coupled with " the Paladin of Souls " it makes a duet of mystical fantasy .  
1	  I bought this and the WE102 to , of course , extend the range of my quite happy , WEP-protected wireless network . The computer to be added belonged to my wife . I have a series of addresses in the 192.168.1 . x range , but the Netgear stuff demands that the network be disabled , and that at least one computer become a 192.168.0 . x in order to put a SECOND WEP on the WGX102 . This , as everyone probably knows , is completely dependent on whether Microsoft feels up to it . I went through 100,000 ipconfigs , etc . I spoke literally for hours to a gentleman in India who was nice but whose accent was so difficult for me to understand I wished I hadn't waited on hold for an hour to talk to him . Yesterday it worked for a while , but today , it doesn't any more . I 'm not a rank amateur , neither am I a geek with all the time in the world . I 'd avoid this like the plague , unlike the other reviewers , none of whom , if I remember correctly , mentioned network security concerns . Long story short-you can't run this setup with a secure network . There is a whole consortium of people out there working to develop standardized home powerline networking . They 've been at it for some time . I don't think they 've gotten anywhere , I 'm sad to say . I gave one star because Amazon doesn't have a lower rank .  
2	  This is a very good case . Everything worked as advertised . I found it easy to install the components .  
2	  This is a great DVD player . I highly recommend . I have had this player now for 4 to 5 years without a problem . I love it . not sure if it is still available . But if it is this is the one to buy .  
1	  Your records may indicate that i never received the above item . Luckily , it wasn't an expensive item . It 's the first time Amazon has ever let me down . Ah Well , Larry  
1	  The only thing that worked was the USB port . Not what I bought it for . All i wanted was the card reader and none of the slots worked , minisd , sd , xd , nothing worked . Junk ! You get what you pay for .  
2	  Although I was sent the wrong item at first , Amazon and the company the product was coming from quickly identified it and immediately shipped out the correct item , even before I had a chance to notify them of the mistake . The cable works well for it 's intended purpose , connecting my upscaling dvd player to my epson projector and the image is clear without any visible interference . Satisfied with the product and the seller !  
2	  I set it up in a few minutes and use it with a home theather / dvd system . It 's loud enough for use in my townhome and I don't see why anyone would want to spend 4 times as much for what I consider the same effect . Great product .  
1	  Product comes coiled and Never seems to uncoil . The double stick tape helps , but product is 6 ft and only 3 ft tape provided .  
2	  This is a really good GPS for outdoors ( hiking / camping ) use . It is very quick to aquire satellites and is capable of displaying MGRS coordinates for those of you in the military . Very very rugged construction . I 've dropped this thing countless times , and kept it in a lower ammo pouch on my body armor while crawling around / dropping into the prone with my full weight on it with no problems . The menu system isn't bad but definitely not the most intuitive , and entering labeling information with the on screen keyboard can be a pain . My only real complaint though is the map set it comes with is bare bones , and that 's being generous . You 'll definitely need to buy a map set micro sd card for your area and they don't come cheap .  
2	  Great features and flexibility , takes great pictures - it 's a wonderful camera for the money .  
1	  I originally gave this TV a one star yesterday because of the poor picture quality . I called Samsung Tech support and they told me to try inserting the HDMI cable to another port , as the port it was in is probably defective . When I plugged in the HDMI cable to another port .. boy .. the picture just came to life . I guess the other port was defective . Take note that this TV has 3 HDMI ports ! The picture is simply amazing ! The default picture settings suck , and you have to calibrate everything in order to get the clearest and sharpest pictures . I am now keeping this T.V. I got this for 943.00 on April 3 , and now it 's up to $ 1,099 ! I lucked out ! Great TV for a great price !  
1	  I 'm a faithful fan of Marantz and have been using them for almost 15 years now for my home stereo equipment ( - speakers ) . The Marantz DV6500 Universal Player for years before upgrading to the newer DV 6001 one for the HDMI technology since I purchased the Marantz SR7002 THE Best Reciever they make . Or HIGHEST GRADE with THX , HDCD , DolbyTrue HD , SRS , and of course DTS among other features . The receiver sounds better than the last but the Player has drop outs when watching TV shows ! It was In the shop 3 times , so for weeks no player . They lost my replacement In the mail and took Into the eigth week to finally get a replacement . IN THE MEANTIME I WAS LUCKY TO ROB MY BEDROOM OF A SONY $ 99.99 player upconverter to use so for 8 weeks the Sony played perfectly . So It 's not my HDMI cable or any other trouble . It 's just not . But now the replacement player IS having DROP OUTS ! Now what do I do ? Yes when working It blows away any competition by far has a phenominal picture ABSOLUTELY AS GOOD AS THE SONY UPCONVERTER ! AND SOUND like you never thought It was going to be . NOTHING COMPARES ! BUT WHAT GOOD IS IT WITH DROP OUTS . Note Drop Outs never with music CD 's only DVD 's . IS THIS GOING TO BE THE START OF 3 MORE REPAIR TRIPS ? NOW THEY WANT TO SEE THE DISCS I 'M PLAYING ? IF I HAD ANY DOUBT IT MAY BE THE DISK don't think I tried that ? But I can tell them they won't get through 2 episodes without a drop out . Who knows If they got that kind of time . Or will they try tell me to go away this time ? 2 lemons unlikely . So I say a design flaw . Don't want to leave marantz maybe get the 5001 . But the store has to give me some kind of credit for mine . I will be going with lower priced models from now on ! As long as it has DTS It 's fine . I have the Marantz SR4002 receiver In my bedroom and It Is fantastic . With DTS . MY ADVICE STICK WITH THE DV 4001 or 3001 and save some money ! This Is a edit addition on 7/10/09I had to hook this up using an optical cable & a tri color cable for picture and sound , to get this to play with no drop outs . Now I have the Marantz SR4002 Receiver In my other room and a Marantz DV4001 for use with It . I 'm having more connection problems . The players remote will not work until warmed up 15 to 20 minutes . I had the PLAYER REPLACED and the new one does the same thing ! Marantz what 's up ? 2 Different Receivers and 2 different players ALL MARANTZ yet each set hasbig connection problems . Your own receivers are having trouble playing your players . Each time I tried a new player but the problems stay the same ? Never thought I 'd think of leaving . I 'd change players before receivers . In fact I hooked a Blu Ray up and that plays fine . Just the Marantz through Marantz has problems .  
1	  August 28th , 2000 I called HP and upon hearing all of the wonderful news about the all " NEW " HP Pavillion , 6730 with an HP Office Jet , model 710 , I could hardly resist buying it ! I was told over the phone that I would receive EVERYTHING that I would need in order to hook it up and be " computing " in minutes , in addition I was told that I would have free 24/7 tech . support WRONG ! I received a USED computer .. some .. I did not receive EVERYTHING that I needed .. My office jet remains [ messed ] up and if that isn't enough ..  
2	  Over several decades , have purchased printers from Brother company . Each has been trouble-free , and all remain in operatonal condition . Other brands have good products , but none better than Brother . Only slight negative for this latest purchase is that instructions seem rather limited relevant to initial installation . However , installation and operational features worked perfectly from initial installation .  
2	  I have been using my PAP3K virtually every day at the gym for the last 18 months and it has always worked reliably . The belt clip sucks , but I just took a lanyard from a trade show badge and clipped it to that . I can walk / jog / run , bike , row , use the nautilus equipment , and a whole variety of other equipment without fear of the thing getting damaged . Heck , it 's even water resitant enough to take out to the local water park during the summer and float around the tube pool . I added an extra 64Meg when I bought mine and used it this past summer for a 15K walk-a-thon . Using WMAs at 96KBit , I loaded enough music to see me through the walk without any repeats . It is really ashamed that Intel decided to get out of the end-consumer products . If this is an example of what they could do the first time out , I 'd really love to see what they could have done given time to improve upon it .  
1	  I purchased this unit after considering alternative such as linksys and hearing that it was the best product in terms of reach for wireless devices . I tried to get the unit going and after running into some random errors ( one of the systems connected via ethernet cable kept getting knocked offline ) i decided to upgrade the firmware w / the patch on the sight . Oops . Once i did that the system went into a state in which it was unreachable ( flashing lights ) . Second unit was sent out to me . Wireless was working great , still having a problem w / a ( different ) connection that kept getting knocked offline . OK , let 's try the firmware upgrade again . Upgraded , 100 % , successful ( so the software said ) . Then , slowly , each machine lost its connection to the web . I looked at the unit and noticed the system lights were not on - the firmware upgrade seemed to put this SECOND system into an unusable state - couldn't reach it in any way , resets didn't work . dead unit # 2 . ( and pls . believe me , this was not user error -i 've been pretty meticulous about it ) . No idea what i 'm going to do next -i suppose i 'll see if 3 's a charm and let you know . After that , i 'm taking suggestions on another brand for this wireless thing !  
1	  An inferior product , period . Cheap pastic flip-lid that is loose , about 1 " play after only 1 day of use . The LED 's that supposedly find your hotspots don't . They flash real neat like , but display no meaningful information . Just all flash together . The software clobbered my wire-line conneciton on XP . The unit did manage to find some rogue access points here and there , but there were no diagnostics like encryption type used , etc . When I managed to get it connected to an AP sitting right next to me , it gave moderate performance . It 's going back . Looked good on paper ..  
2	  Over all I think this pruduct is wonderful ! I can take songs of the internet or rip songs of my cds and burn them onto a cd or cd-rw . I love not having to burn cd day after day and with this I can just burn the songs once and have plenty of music to listen too ( 10 HOURS ! ) . The anti - shock is GREAT and it never seems to skip , not even if i bang it around . When I am playing my mp3 's it never skips because of the almost 100 seconds of protection when playing mp3s . I greatly think that this product is the right thing if u love music .  
2	  Unlike * all * the other manufacturers out there who seem to have been blind-sided by the advent of Windows Vista , this Bluetooth transceiver works right out of the box . Just be aware that their in-box installation documentation needs to be updated and download their latest drivers from their web site . ( Trust me , I have done a lot of research , and none of the other manufacturers have so much as Vista drivers ! )  
1	  where do i start ? we had so many problems with this product and this company . first of all , " 40-hour " is an outright lie , unless you record programs on the lowest quality , which has totally unacceptable video and audio quality . we set it up to record " first-run " episodes of some recurring programs and it never listened to that and recorded ALL episodes , thereby filling up it 's memory with programs we didn't ask for . we needed to return the unit because the sound wouldn't work 90 % of the time . when we called the company , they said they charge a $ 60 " exchange fee " .. to return their own faulty product ! at best that 's very , very shifty and at worst it 's probably against consumer-protection law in 38 states . after being on the phone with them for 15 minutes , they agreed to take the product back if we paid for the shipping . again , costing the consumer at least $ 20 for something that is the fault of the company . they know how much the shipping costs and they had my credit card information . how hard is it to do the right thing and credit my account for the return shipping ? we bought a wireless adaptor that was listed as compatible by linksys , but TiVo didn't have the driver required for the upgraded model . we had to return the adaptor and find the outdated model elsewhere . so basically , TiVo doesn't sell the components required to run their own product and when it comes to TiVo components , the word " compatible " means " nope . " all the way around , the TiVo product and the TiVo company are jokes . I give it a year and the TiVo service will only be found in other manufacturers ' DV-Rs .  
1	  I bought the Apex AD1500 for a great price , and nine months later , it won't play any disks . Apex says it will fix the machine for [ price ] plus shipping . I can't get it fixed locally because Apex won't sell parts or service information to others . While it worked , it produced good entry level sound and picture . After all , digital is digital , but I 'll never buy another Apex product again .  
1	  After reading several reviews , I was so excited to try my new headphones . I thought the price was good for the quality of ` phones . My old headphones were 3x 's as much and only lasted about 2 years , that maybe 23 months longer then these . For some reason I keep losing power on the base unit which results in total static in my ears ! I rechecked the connection , everything was fine . It works when I disconnect and reconnect everything , which is a pain in the middle of the night with my spouse asleep in bed . This has happened 4 times in less then a month . Last night I was too tired to mess with it so I unplugged the ' phones and just made my husband sleep to the sounds of my movie . Tonight I 'll go home and see if I have a bad connection , one more try . I have a feeling these will be returned very soon . Also the phones don't come with the metal storage rack as pictured . Contacted the retailer , the retailer said they would contact the manufacturer and ship out the missing piece . Got a follow up email from the retailer saying the " Hook " is not supplied in this model . Then why is it pictured ? Oh , and already had to replace the batteries in the headphones . Not rechargeable like my last phones . Again I think I will send these back and pay a little bit more for a better quality pair .  
1	  While i hear all teh best about this camera my very first impression is that upon opening its its already missing Parts Mainly the stereo headset . if i cmpany cant get it correct at the plant than im not interested it .  
2	  Not much to say here except that it works right out of the box . No software installation necessary . Small in size and does just what you think a flash drive should do .  
2	  This was my first GPS and overall I am very happy with the Nuvi 360 . I do have two small complaints : 1 . The volume is not loud enough to here clearly over the engine and road noise . 2 . The screen is not bright enough in bright sunlight .  
1	  Never fire up unit . Placed an order for a new unit , received refabricated unit . Returned unit paying for return postage at ANTOnline 's instructions . No attempt by ANTOnline to correct mistake or pay for return postage . Amazon made me financially well . Cost about four more days before computer repaired .  
1	  I was very disappointed that this Ipod which I gave to my husband as a birthday gift came without a book of directions for use .  
2	  It sounds pretty good through the supplied headphones , but it 's not 5-star sound . It doesn't skip in my normal use ( daily commute ) , it 's lightweight , so far ( not quite 3 months ) it 's reliable . The remote is easyo use and has all the functions I need - including a " hold " button that works independently of the hold button on the main unit . I use the AC adapter ( included ) when I listen to it at work , so the batteries only get used for about 5-10 hours / week . I 'm still using the last of the three pairs of batteries that are also included - this player really does run a long time on 2 AAs . My only nit is that the controls on the main unit are arranged in small clusters , and require a little care to use . I like it enough , especially for the price , that I bought a second one , for my wife .  
1	  No review or terrible review - because I am not sure how this sysytem of extended service plan works with this seller . Was this supposed to be an email document or something more solid that I am supposed to get in the mail ? I am unsure because I have not received anything in the mail so please clarify asap .  
1	  My Batteris are dead , I put them in my camera and they didnot work . I want to return them . I bought them in May , 2005 I just open them August 14 , 2005 . I rate them a " 0 " Betty J McDonald701 Oats St # 309Texarkana AR 71854shebj @ aol . com  
1	  The drive ran fine for 6 months , then failed without warning . A disaster ! Do not buy this drive !  
2	  decent okay not bad does the job sometimes doesnt connect sometimes sAYS it cant be connect sometimes its half way and it says its fully charged but over all a majority of the time its good  
2	  Recently bought this unit as an upgrade . I really prefer a multi-disc changer with a random function , versus a single disc player , as a way to mix up some favorite discs . The audio is simply excellent . I am hearing all the detail I would expect in a high-end single disc player . I note very little noise from the unit as the discs change , and silence through the speakers as this occurs . As others have mentioned , check the dimensions on this one relative to your cabinet , because it 's a legit 17 " x 17 " .  
1	  dont you hate when they put a picture up of something they are selling and when you get the item it looks nothing like the picture ? this item is not the one in the picture . i bought this cause my strap broke and wanted the replacement . at panisonic they wanted 25 plus shipping for the strap .. well I would have been better paying it than falling for the sucker buy on this misadvertised item . cheers !  
1	  Paid $ 20 for this . Code is invalid . What else can I say ? Amazon should back up what they sell . Now I have to dispute . Brutal . Don't buy .  
1	  When I purchased this item , I was in a tiny college dorm single . I picked this product out of the lineup because : 1 . It is a Sony ( You can't deny that Sony has a great run of products ) 2 . Compact design and clever handle3 . Despite its size , it still includes a cassette if ever the mood strikes to make a mix tapeAdmittedly , I had BIG expectations for such a small product . My problems with the product were : 1 . Bass only has an " On " or " Off " setting . I am a firm advocate for manual controls . The sound you get out of this unit is pretty shallow . You need the ability to find a good balance of both treble and bass for optimum music output . Just not possible with this unit . 2 . Jogger skips tracks , not volume ? ! It 's just counter-intuitive . How often do you need to jog through tracks quickly , back and forth ? At least for me , I only occasionally skip a song or two . I 'd much rather have the jogger control the volume - especially when I need to quickly turn down the volume . 3 . Digital display is only visible from a higher angle at a close range . Sometimes I just want to know what track is playing without having to get up and walk across the room . Don't get me wrong , there are some good parts about this boombox too : 1 . Its petite design was perfect for my cramped living situation . Fits in my milk-crate ! 2 . It produces a high volume for such a tiny design . Like I said , not too great in sound-quality , but pumps up the volume ! 3 . Old school recordable cassette feature . I know a lot of youngsters today may not need it , but being able to make a mix tape is still charming < 3Be sure you know what you 're looking for in a boombox . At the time of my purchase , this boxette was just fine . Its convenience was more valuable to me than its capabilities . Now that I 'm living in a larger space , this little bugger just won't cut it . I 'd rather be stashing away my $ 60 towards somthing with a deeper , crisper sound and better functionality .  
1	  I was happy with the noise canceling features , not the best but definitely works . Great for airplane rides - really helps cut out that background engine noise . My problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design - the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by Targus ( cheers to them ) . the second set broke too in a different place - the deisgn of these just isn't very sturdy . I 'm gentle with my stuff too , so either I had bad luck w / two defective units or they 're just not made well .  
2	  Great FireWire cable . Really , really , really , really , really , really really really really really really really really really really really really cool .  
2	  The 8 Pin Mini DIN was perfect for my application . I used an ethernet cable to extend the control of a Sony HD camera to 400 ' . Worked for what i needed and shipped in a matter of days .  
2	  Purchased this as a gift for our son . Item came on time and is exactly as pictured and described . Compartments are roomy and well organized . Lap Top compartment is decently padded . Zippers look sturdy as does the overall construction of the bag . We 're very satisfied with this purchase .  
1	  This invasive monster slowed my system and has permanently removed the change / remove programs icon from control panel . I uninstalled it and reset my system back a day and am still having problems . I did try to install it without software , but then the mic didn't work . STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAMERA . IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL !  
2	  I have used this 50 ft . cable now for a few months and have not notice any type of interference or lack of speed . It seems to be performing as specified .. now if it only survives the heat of a Texas summer , as it 's run thru the attic !  
2	  This is my second pair of these DJ headphones . My first lasted 7 years and I 'm looking forward to the next 7 . I can't say enough good things about them , so I 'll stick with " they rock ! " .  
1	  When I first bought this in summer 2007 , I was very happy with this little camera . But soon after , I started to struggle with uploading the videos onto my computer . Nine tries out of ten , the PC just didn't seem to " see " the device , so the Flip software failed to initiate . It took me multiple attempts to save my video files onto my PC . Finally today , after spending a maddening two hours trying to retrieve updated firmware from the Flip webside and trying every USB port on my PC without being able to save my videos , I called customer support . A very nice and patient man spent 3 hours on the phone with me and we still couldn't figure it out . After all else failed , he finally suggested I take it to a nearby CVS Pharmacy that happens to have a Pure Digital machine that could make a DVD from the videos on the Flip recorder . It didn't work . The CVS machine didn't " see " my Flip either . So , six hours later , my videos are still trapped on my Flip and I am no closer to a solution . The nice young man in customer support said he would escalate my case to higher level technical support and I should expect a call back in a few days . I 'm so sorry I bought this product . What a sad waste of time and money !  
2	  Mount secures well to the bike and the new battery door attaches firmly to the garmin . Works just as it should .  
1	  It 's quite disappointing that the black pack which carries the manuals , cleaning cloth and the MacOS DVD 's doesn't have the DVD 's in it on my new Macbook Pro purchased :( Amazon , please send me the original DVD 's ASAP  
1	  I 've had 3 ATI TV cards and none has worked out for me . This is across 3 computers and endless driver updates spanning 5 years . Here is a list of problems :* The software is difficult to install . Particular files need to be installed in a particular order . Even then it may not work . * Picture and sound often get out of sync . * Even scrolling through a web page can cause the picture and sound to become choppy . * It can't handle static ( it crashes my system ) , whether it be from a disconnected cable box or from the use of old-school rabbit ears . * It crashes randomly . * The software tells me that there is no signal even though the message itself is on top of a good signal where I can even change the channel and record the program . To get around it , since I 'm using a cable box , I open the tv program , turn it off , disable the TV Tuner from Device Manager , and restart the TV program . Hopefully a fix is on the way . * ATI 's own website has dead links in the troubleshooting section and doesn't always post the right files for your TV card . For some reason , I recently had to hunt down the capture driver by looking up a different product . I would 've appreciated support from ATI , but that 's practically non-existent . I 've also had Hauppauge products that have worked smoothly . Perhaps I 'll go back to that .  
2	  It fits my 15.4 " gateway notebook , but barely ! It 's a little too snug for my taste . If you have a thin 15.4 " notebook this sleeve should be fine . I have a thick laptop and the sleeve is very tight on it . Again , it works best for thin laptops .  
2	  I just received my NIC yesterday , installed it today in my computer which did have Windows 98 but I replaced with Unbuntu 8.10 . The network card connected me to my cable network without my having to even download the drivers from the CD . Wow , that was easy !  
1	  I used the micro SD in my new cell phone and it worked once but then it got fried or something cause it stopped working . The larger one didn't work at all . Not happy with it at all .  
1	  If you are a pc gamer then you should not get this cpu . This thing came with my new pc and i have made many upgrades to my computer but the cpu was the latest one . No matter how many ultra powerful parts i put in my new pc i noticed there was still major slowdown in a lot of games , well i found out that this cpu was to blame . You get what you pay for with this processor and thats a single core running at 3.3Ghz , 533Mhz front side bus , and a low memory Cache . Also i noticed that this cpu heats up very quickly and thats just in idle mode ! If you are not a pc gamer and are looking for a low priced cpu that will let you do word documents with no problem then you should get this , but if you intend to multitask then stay away from this one .  
1	  I read the reviews and felt it was worth a try . I will not purchase again . The black was fine but the color looks terrible . I had purchased 2 black and 2 color . The first color cartridge I tried would not print green very well . Colors looked more yellow than green . After using that cartridge for a while ( it lasted about 1/2 as long as cannon cartridges ) , I replaced it with the second color cartridge . That one would not print green or blue at all . I suggest that if you want color , either spend the extra money and buy from cannon or try another replacement cartridge company .  
2	  Long story short , I removed the old compound and used the Arctic Silver 5 and it works like a charm . I never had a slowdown when I play games on my laptop , and it always tends to heat up . I highly recommend it to people who need to replace their old compound with this .  
1	  When I received my product from the postman about 5 minutes ago , I immediately noticed that it was used ; to the point that a dark fingerprint was visible on the left mouse button . This is actually very hard to do considering the dark silver color of the mouse buttons . I quickly reviewed the comments section of the order slip that came with the product , and it said , " BRAND NEW , FACTORY SEALED . YOUR SATISFACTION IS GUARANTEED ! " Unless Logitech ' Factory Seals ' their products with plastic baggies , then I think that Buy Direct Corp just lied to me . And I guess it doesn't help that they failed on their guarantee of my satisfaction either . So 0/3 , and they even used CAPS LOCK.I called them up to get a refund , and they answered right away and after some haggling , they promised to email me a packing slip . They can't use caps lock on the phone , so maybe they are telling the truth . Conclusion : I will never buy from this company again , and I recommend you do the same ( unless you like paying shipping for products you didn't order ) .  
1	  SANDISK was destroyed by PostOffice sorting machine , because seller put item in a letter envelope and had the nerve to charge me $ 4.95 for a 64 cents mailing . His putting item in an ENVELOPE caused the post office to run it through their sorting machine , which then destroyed the SanDisk . How do I get my money back ?  
2	  I payed for the code and 2 minutes later .. BAM got my code .. now im playing marvel vs capcom 2  
1	  Not at all happy with this device . The claim " compatible with all serial devices " the reality is it is not . I wanted to connect my LaserWriter to my iMac ( serial to USB ) . After much frustration I called Belkin and was told that this product does not support LaserWriter printers . Belkin was not very helpful and returning the product means I am out the shipping . If you are considering this product call to get specific compatiblity specs .  
2	  Needed a new hard drive for my mom 's laptop as the old one was going out . This is the exact same model as the one that was originally in it , and it works just fine with Windows 7 running on it .  
1	  I have an 01 Chevy . The OEM radio has a smaller connector than on this product . When I called Circuit City ( where I eventually purchased , and paid more $ 29 ) about this , they told me there was not any other model and that I 'd have to pay $ 15 .. times 2 .. for converters . That 's $ 50-60 total for this feature . So , I hooked up the antenna extender included in the box and guess what - it worked fine . No static . Even in Houston , I found a station ( 95.3 ) that worked just fine without this expensive feature . I haven't looked for a version that 's made to work with my car without needing adapters , but it seems I don't need this device or CC 's overpriced connectors . Make sure you check the return policy if buying . I will certainly be returning mine to the store . I don't need it or it 's overpriced conversion connectors .  
2	  This is my second identical headset . I use one in my home office 1-4 hrs a day and the first headset lasted about 4-5 years . For a $ 10 headset I think that 's outstanding . It has no volume control but my phone does so it is not an issue .  
1	  Please do not buy this ink . My printer head is gone bad and i had to buy new a printer .  
2	  I got this camera as a replacement for my Kodak DC 280 , which is a very good and reliable camera . I am really pleased with it , although you have to get familiarized with the buttons and setting up the features . Things I like : Different resolutions that fit to your needs , whether it 's quality or memory space . It includes a 1024X768 resolution enabling you to display your pictures in full size as your wall papers . Flash modes include elimination of red eye . Self Timer 2 or 10 secs . The second option is best if you want to be in the picture . Can connect to your TV so you can share the pictures with friends who don't have a computer and with out the need of printing them . You can record video clips , but I rather use my camcorder for that . Up to 3.2 megapixelsOptical Zoom , beacuse digital zooms affect the image . Includes USB for computer and AV cables for TV or VCR to record your picture slideshows on videotape . PRICE : NOW IT IS UNDER 200 DOLLARSCompact Flash Cards are the cheaper memory cards in the market , and also my fomer camera uses this media so I save in getting more flash memory . 32 MB COMPACT FLASH CARD INCLUDED other cameras include only 16 MB media cardsRecommendations : Battery Charger and rechargable Batteries . It is better to use rechargable batteries with this cameras , they last longer and don't need to be buying often . You should have two sets for when one runs dry you change them . Card Reader . Nowadays computers include them . If you can buy a Compact Flash Reader or Universal one . It will help you save battery life and time , because you don't have to set up camera drivers to connect the camera to your computer or install the software included with the camera . This is definitely a great deal , considering you can only get 3.2 MP cameras under 200 dollars if the have a digital zoom instead of an optical one , and use more expensive memory cards , and by the way you also get a 32 MB card instead of the usual 16 MB included in the box . And I have forgotten to mention is not any camera is a Canon , a leader in the market . Whether you are starting in the digital camera world or have more experience this is a great deal .  
1	  The VCR arrived carefully packed in bubble wrap in a box that had not been dropped . I could hear pieces rattling loose in the box as I unpacked it . Once opened , I could see that the unit had been dropped on the left front corner before packing . I knew this because the packing was not damaged , and there was big dent and break on the left front corner . The front panel had been pushed to the right by the damage so that the dvd drawer could not open and VCR tapes could not go in . I opened the unit , poured out the broken pieces , and bent the metal frame back into its rectangular shape so that I could line up the front panel with the inner works . The unit worked , but looks pretty bad . I told Discount Jungle . They answered that there was nothing they could do . They suggested that I contact the manufacturer . If they got a broken unit from Sylvania , why did they ship it out ? This is by far the worst experience and lack of service that I have had in buying though Amazon .  
1	  Beware of trying to use this card with Windows 95 operating systems . It does not work . And Linksys ' technical support is as bad as other people have said - non responsive ! Try the Netgear FA410 instead , it may have a dongle cord but at least it works !  
1	  I 've had one of these for about a year now and I wouldn't do it again . It still sounds good , but the remote is awful and the dvd player is buggy . On mine , it will occasionally lose the picture for no apparent reason , and the only way to get it back is to turn it off and restart the disc .  
2	  I purchased this Velocity cable to patch my Dish Network receiver to a SDTV card in my computer . The picture is excellent and so is the sound . Perfect cable for the job , I watch TV in a window on the PC monitor while using the computer .  
2	  I needed a polarizer for my 18-35 mm lens , looked over what was available and bought the Tiffen . Works great easy on and of the lens , full coverage with no vignetting  
1	  I don't understand the good reviews of this headset even if they were given when the product first came out . They are cheaply made and very difficult to connect to any standard bluetooth driver . The sound quality is poor as well .  
1	  I did some research and read a lot of reviews at many sites and online retailers for this FM transmitter . I decided to buy it since I was planning a road trip around New England and some Canadian cities , and thought this would be the greatest companion for my MP3 player during the trip . I has very dissapointed by it 's weak signal . When there is no static , and the device is able to fully transmit to the selected station , the sound is no better than a AM radio station . It sounds very low quality . But most of the time , in both cities and the open road , I got static . I was so frustrated by it , that I stopped at a W @ llm @ rt store and bought a cassette adapter for $ 9 which was way better than this device . I realize not all cars have a cassette player these days , but if your car does , without a doubt they are better than any FM transmitter . After the trip was over , I returned the rental car I had , and tested it on my wife 's SUV and also in my own car and the results were exactly the same . On a positive note , it kept my MP3 player charged the whole trip .  
1	  I would have returned this product if I didnt spend so much time and effort putting it together , THEN finding out that one of the metal pieces was bent . My husband had to put a shim in there to make the stationary side level . It doesn't roll too well and is rickety . Worth half what I paid ..  
2	  I use my Zen for music and for listening to audio books I download from the libary . I also like the Line In feature which is great for converting old tapes to digital format . You play an audio book from a tape player and use the Line In cable to convert it . Works great . Here 's a nice trick for removing Windows DRM protection from audio files . Play them on your computer and record them immediately to disk by using a $ 4 cable from RadioShack to connect the microphone jack to the headphone jack on your computer . Bingo , you 've got an mp3 file . Then just copy it to your Zen player . The Zen V Plus stores photos and acts as a voice recorder . I especially like the BOOKMARK feature . You can set up to 10 bookmarks - this is important for listening to audio books and long podcasts . 2GB is plenty of storage space for several audio books and enough for 1000 songs . The sound quality is great on the Zen V Plus and the menus are easy to navigate . This is a nice player and you really can't go wrong . It 's a bit thicker than an Ipod but shorter . Nice feel to it .  
1	  I bought one . It died over the space of a few days . I replaced it w / another . It wouldn't even turn on . HP tech support cannot deal w / a hardware problem ( the machine could be spitting flames out the air vents and they 'd tell you to reinstall XP ) . Their checklist for every problem says reinstall first . The first thing you do for that is reformat the hard drive . That 's 3 hours w / this sytem . You have to hang up and call back when it 's done . This gives you a new tech support person , who talks you thru the reinstall from that point . If you 're having a hardware problem , the reinstall probably fails . They look up your new problem . The checklist says to reinstall . The first step is to reformat the hard drive , so call them back in 3 hours . Rince and repeat . I replaced it w / another brand that is working fine . HP sucks . One star is generous , but it 's the lowest I could go .  
1	  At $ 963.83 on May 25 , 2002 I bought this product , that now sells for less than half the price I paid . Since the very beginning , this diabolic machine gave us trouble with its tendency to perform in unusual ways ( as compared with the similar DVD players we own ) . Now , it has ceased to function entirely due to ( what the repair man confirms ) is a set of instructions programmed by Philips to render the machine useless to its very owner .. Great ! Don't buy this trash , which I 'm using as a test of amazon . com 's reliability and good will to its naive customers .  
1	  I 've owned mine about a year . So far , no durability issues , and the sound is excellent - with one caveat : you need a device that can crank it up a bit , since the native sound isn't all that loud . BUT .. I find it to be very uncomfortable when placed alongside the ear . The hard internal speaker is really easy to fit into the plush sleeve , but using it directly against your ear - rather than under the pillow - is anything but the " teddy-bear " like experience CCrane promises . You feel the hard speaker through the cover , and it isn't nice . Again , under the pillow works , but volume can be weak . With my bedside radio - a Logitech Squeezebook Radio - I can't get enough volume . I realized I already had a better solution : tune in to the radio via an internet radio app on my iphone and stick the phone itself , volume up , under the pillow . Very little ( if any ) chance of damage to the phone , and it works beautifully . Many of the radio apps have sleep functions , or you can play a podcast in iTunes and use the " sleep after current playlist is done " function in the iPhone 's native clock app . :  
2	  I 've been going through speaker systems left and right the past week and this Creative Labs T3000 is the only one that stays . The bass is clean and blends well . The midrange is a little too forward for some recordings but a simple equilizer adjustment smooths it right on out . ( If I could not make an E.Q. adjustment then I wouldn't want them . ) The highs are pleasant and not too gritty or harsh . There is a smoothness in the top end that the others lacked .. cymbals sound like cymbals . Hard to fault for $ 50.00 . Played softly to moderatly it has a very classy sort of sound . Push the bass or volume too hard and it sounds like crap . After all , 50 bucks is 50 bucks so don't expect too much .. but among it 's peers it 's head and shoulders above the rest . And I intensley dislike the sound quality in the rest of the Creative lineup . Spending more gets you less unless it 's more bass you want . My listening habits are piano , classical , classic rock and pop rock . If you are into bass heavy music pushed hard or a home theater thumper then this is not the one . If you want a speaker that can reasonably reproduce the music then this is worth a try . If you are really picky then go buy a nice amp and a high quality two way book shelf or perhaps a nice 2.1 . $ 50.00 will not buy a miracle . All I want is something that sounds pleasant without irritating . This T3000 and a simple Bose 2.0 are the only ones I 've heard that could pull that off in my opinion . I prefer the sound of these to the others I 've listened to at Circuit City and Best Buy in the $ 49.00 to $ 149.00 range . That does not mean I am right , only that I prefer the sound of these . Prefereance can't be agrued against , it 's what I like . You may not like what I like and that 's O.K. , so please listen for yourself .  
1	  Avoid these headphones at all costs , especially if you would buy these to listen with while you work out . Mine lasted for about a month and a half before the cord started decomposing . The material used is very poor , the white turns yellow and then disintegrates just through normal use . If you are considering these for working out , don't buy them , they will not stay in your ears . That is assuming you sweat when you workout , these will slip out and just become more of an annoyance than anything .  
2	  For a really cheap way to protect your gear - this is a great deal . I did not read the details , and the package actually comes with 2 bags - and I ordered 2 , so my Son got 2 bags for his gear as well . It rained almost the entire time in New York , England and France - and I am really glad I made this last minute purchase . I had been looking at the expensive rain gear but could not pull the trigger . I was able to change lenses repeatedly at Stonehenge in pouring rain without any rain getting on my lenses or camera body . NOTE : It is a little difficult to find a tiny hole in the bag that goes over your viewfinder - you might want to find it and mark it with a sharpie before you are attempting to use the bag for the first time in the rain . Update 10/4/2011 : I spent the week at Niagara Falls and Niagara on the Lake in rain , mist , and beneath the falls , on Maid of The Mist , Hurricane Deck and this is by far the best investment in my whole bag ( <$ 7.00 to protect thousands of dollars of gear ) . I would suggest that they put a bungie / elastic end rather than the rope - it would be cheaper to manufacture and easier to install / manage . Still 4.5 stars !  
1	  4 months old and off to the Service center . The sub shut off so I used my back up sub . Same problem . Major pops out the sub channel . I would stay away from this one . When it worked it sounded real good .  
1	  We received the TV and DVD Player as a gift for our daughter . At first it was great but after a few months , the dvd player stopped working . You just hear the disc spinning inside and nothing else happens . This does not appear to be a case of a few people getting lemons . The quality of this product is very poor and unreliable . Not worth the money , no matter how cute .  
1	  The reviews for this product are excellent and I was so excited to upgrade to HDMI switching . The first unit received had a loud hum in the audio and HDMI from my new Sony player through this unit created an extreme blue cast on the video . I returned the unit and another was sent to me . This unit had no hum in the audio but the blue cast was still there when using HDMI from the Sony DVD player . It was not the DVD player because when I hooked the HDMI from the DVD player directly to my TV everything was perfect . I am very disappointed in this unit . As for Amazon , they have been great in responding to my problems , getting a replacement unit to me and then refunding my purchase . I give Amazon 5 stars .  
1	  The JVC DF420AU D-VHS tape does exactly what it proposes : given a properly set up D-VHS VCR , it makes perfect pixel by pixel copies of HDTV . I cannot see any difference between live and recorded high definition TV when I use these and a firewire connection with my HM-DH40000 . You can also tape SVHS or VHS formats on this tape , and those formats come out quite nicely as well . However , the quiet secret here is that the formulation here is essentially identical to high quality S-VHS tape - at 4 times the price . The only difference is that rather than having a single hole in the chassis this tape has a second , allowing the VCR to read it as a D-VHS tape rather than a S-VHS tape . There is an obvious workaround to this that can be found fairly easily on the web ; search if you 're interested . From my experience S-VHS tapes with the workaround work just as well as this far more expensive tape , which is why I knock off two stars , and a third for a price gouging at 1.5 times the already outrageously expensive 150 minute D-VHS DF300AU . I can't guarantee S-VHS tapes will last as long , but then again , since there 's no warranty on the D-VHS tapes either there doesn't seem to be much risk . I also haven't been able to tell any difference between the JVC and Maxwell DVHS versions , which is unsurprising . Data recording - which is all D-VHS really is - either records data or it doesn't . Cheaper tapes definitely will have drop outs , but quality tapes won't . One further note . There are still a few 3 hour SVHS tapes available at half the cost of this from dealers , which would be my recommendation if you need to archive long sagas like the LOTR movies , Saving Private Ryan , or the Deer Hunter when they show up on premium cable HDTV . Short of archiving sports directly from a tuner instead of a PVR , there 's not much that can't fit on a 3 hour tape instead of the much more expensive 3.5 hour version sold here .  
2	  High quality , works great and the price also was very decent . Received the cables very quickly as well , very nice !  
1	  Similar to the review before mine . I bought this because i thought it records on both - / + formats . Even on the unit it says - and + but it only records to + which isn't compatible with a lot of players . i inserted a dvd-r , and it said please insert a dvd + r or + rw .. bummer i had high hopes for this thing . up on eBay it goes .  
1	  This is the worst product you can buy because you will lose it soon after you put it in your key chain . The cap is made of cheap plastic that will break extremely easily . I lost mine 2 weeks after I bought it - What a bunch of cheap engineers , it 's as if they designed to be lost - sad thing I will never buy a memorex product - they should stick to CDs !  
1	  This is not even close to the quality of the original battery . Barely holds a charge after using it for several months .  
1	  Installing the software for this thing caused my SQL Server instance to drop all its databases and reset the system administrator password . If that isn't enough , the videos it captured were full of snow and interferance . Over the last 15 years I 've bought a lot of computer stuff , but I gotta say that this thing is by far the worst . Its a discredit to Amazon that they even sell this item .  
2	  Update ! ( June 2009 ) After the digital conversion , this booster was boosting the signal too much . I removed it and now it all works well . I find this hard to believe since I am splitting my little antenna 8 ways and then two of the 8-way splits are split in half once more . Everything still works w / o this amp . now . Crazy ! Original posting ) I purchase this to use with my DTV antenna that I am installing on my roof . I have to split the signal 8-ways , so a signal booster is called for . This booster seemed like a good one since it did not have any gimmicky splitters built in like others I have seen . My house has a big central wiring panel and I have a very good splitter in the panel . I know that putting the booster when there is only one cable / TV unit in the line and the signal is already good is not going to help ; it actually can deteriorate the signal . This did exactly that . But , once I hooked up this amplifier to the exterior antenna and then to the house splitter ( I only have 3 TVs hooked up , but since the splitter is an 8-way splitter it is still dropping the signal ) everything worked much better than I expected ! I have no signal loss at my DTV receivers . I find this hard to believe , but that is what the meters say on the receivers . There is no difference between having the antenna cable hooked up directly to 1 TV and having the booster , the splitter and the three TVs / receivers . I should remove the booster and see what happens , but since everything is working so well I don't want to mess with it . I guess I lucked out .  
1	  Obviously the " subwoofer " is a tiny little vibrating element in the phones . And the result of that is it feels and sounds like you 're wearing vibrating headphones . It doesn't sound like bass at all , it sounds like noise . And it feels weird . They are very comfortable and block out a lot of ambient noise . But even at the $ 35 I paid for them , I could have gotten better for the money .  
1	  Length : 1:06 Mins  
1	  Chances are none of these will work . Don't waste your money on memorex like I did ! Try Verbatim instead , they work every time . Nothing more frustrating than watching discs fail one after another after another ! I will never buy memorex discs again !  
1	  There is no picture and specification for this product . I do not know if this product is a used workstation system or a piece of RAM . The product name sounds like a workstation system , but the price is close to other rams in the same search list . However , that price is reasonable for a used system which is selling in a store I stoped by one day . So it is confusing because there is no much information about this product . Sorry my rating is meant to the prodcut ad . , not the product itself .  
2	  These light stands barely do the job of holding up 24 " photoflood softboxes , and they do look pretty professional from a distance . But they are so lightweight and flexy that I would never trust anything that weighed more than a few pounds at full extension . I ordered some new Manfrotto 1004BAC $ 85 light stands to replace this , as I feel like I 'm young enough to get a full lifetime out of them , so why waste life with cheap gear .  
1	  Bought this item about 6 months ago . I had hell installing the drivrs . Finally had to download the software abandon the CD and got the software to work properly . Six months later the machine stopped working . The power adapter is fine but the machine itself is just dead . Waste of money . Cost of cartridges will send you into bankruptcy .  
2	  does this player come with a car adapter or is there a place to get one ?  
1	  Bought this for my wife for Christmas and spent time pre-loading photos only to have the keychain break and the frame got lost within 2 weeks ! The buttons are also very cheaply made and didn't work well from the beginning . The photos look good but this is made very cheaply and won't last long at all . I can't even return it because when it broke it got lost !  
2	  This wall Charger was in new condidtion , and it works fine . Unfortunately , now I have to order a replacement battery pack for the DS . The delivery time was fast and the price low .. So I will buy from this seller again .  
2	  I use the C100S with XP , so my opinion is based solely on that experience . Others have posted issues with Vista or other OS 's so take it for what it 's worth . I don't have a landline phone at home , I only use my cell phone . This worked out great until I started working from home a lot , and multi-hour conference calls for work were really eating up my cell minutes . Then I discovered Skype gives you FREE calls to toll free numbers ( like my company conference system ) . The C100S gives me a excellent quality , noise and echo cancelling speakerphone for making free conference calls of unlimited length .. exactly what I needed . Is it perfect ? No , not by a long shot : 1 . The USB cord is permanently attached and very thin . when it breaks ( and I 'm sure it will ) , the unit is toast . I wouldn't be winding and unwinding the cord any more than is absolutely necessary . 2 . The USB cord storage compartment will never close after the first time you take the cable out . You will not be able to rewind the cable in the exact meticulous fashion required for the cover to close completely . 3 . Nobody is going to use this device as the default audio speaker for your PC , but the Communicator software will pop up an error message warning you it 's not the default every time you use it . It 's like having a warning that you 're fly is up .. I know and that 's how it 's supposed to be . Other than those annoyances , it 's excellent . It 's nice to have a hard button for mute and volume control , the LED ring lights up green when you 're online and red when you 're muted .. just like the big Polycom units , and most importantly it sounds great on both ends of the conversation .  
2	  The product works great for a replacement power cord . The price is excellent and they have fast shipping . I would definitely recommend this product for people looking for a new power cord .  
2	  The external hard drive is everything I wanted and more . For a few more dollars than a Lexar ( or any other brand ) , I got another 4 GB of storage . The device practically runs itself-no hassles , it was up and running 30 seconds after it came out of the package . In fact , it took me more time to get it out of the package than it did to get it on my computer . Its size is about twice that of my Lexar Jump Drive , so it 's still tiny and will fit in the smallest shirt pocket . It also has its own built-in USB in an ingenious arrangement-simply coil it around the device itself and roll it shut . Why did I buy a Lexar when I could have bought another Seagate ?  
1	  If you like to take pictures with macro lense , it sucks . I 've had many canon cameras and this one takes the the prize for worst quality . If you get closer than five inches , the pictures messes up . I 've had no other problem with the hardware , though I hate carrying around that dock and it 's odd shaped charger . No other charger cable in the world is going to fit ! So loose it and you 're screwed . oh , and night photos also suck . BIG TIME , even with the flash on .  
2	  It 's an HDMI cable , exactly as stated , and it works . In other words , it is what it says it is , and does the job well . I 'm not enough of a techie to be able to report any more than that . I plugged it into my DVR , and the other end into my TV , and it works !  
1	  This is the second Sony we purchased . I received this last year for Mother 's Day eventhough it had a tape and wasn't digital . We wanted to be able to transfer our old tapes onto dvd 's but wanted to record also . To our surprise when we went on vacation and went to record we get a black screen , playback works , but you can't record . This is common with this camera , save your money and buy a different camera , this is the second sony we have had problems with . check this problem by doing a search and put in the model number , but please , if you want to use for special occasions , how would you like to get sound only ? and be faced with costly repairs ? Buy a different camera .  
2	  These HDMI Cables are fantastic ! I don't know why people buy those expensive cables at electronic stores for $ 30.00 to $ 80.00 when they are of no better quality that I can see .. Efforcity sent those cables to me in a very timely manner , I recommend them highly ..  
1	  This is a very bad bug zapper . Although it worked fine for a week , it the proceded to die . This happened with TWO new units . No rain , no bad weather , just a piece of junk .  
1	  We bought this dvd player in May of 2004 , used it 4 or 5 times . The sound is very low in the car so you must buy the ear phones . We pulled it out recently for a trip and the left hinge just broke ! We were very careful with this item and yet it broke and is out of warranty . Save your money and don't buy Polaroid DVD players .  
2	  My husband and I both got this bag for hauling our books and 17 " dell laptops to school . It is a really big bag , I thought it would look gaudy but it doesn't . It 's got ample room for my laptop and books for like 4-5 classes . I like the drink sleeve on the side , with a slide thingy to keep it locked in place , no matter what the size . One great feature is that the shoulder straps , on the top part , are space far enough apart for guys to have it on their backs . A guy friend of mine has a different laptop backpack cannot wear his because his shoulders are too broad , he 's got to wear it over the shoulder . Also , the straps are adjustable . While the pack is on , you can tighten the straps and when you need to take it off , one hand is all you need to loosen it up if you need too . There are compartments for your cell phone , pens , etc . You will not be disappointed . Amazon is also the cheapest I have found this for .  
2	  I initially bought the canon zr-70 but returned it after a few days because of its dismal and grainy indoor footage . Next went with the trv-19 , and i love it . It takes great footage outdoors and indoors , with no notice of any grain in the low light footage . I cant find anything to say bad about this camera !  
1	  I bought this mount because I wanted to be able to adjust both the vertical and horizontal alignment of my new HDTV panel . The product description says this item can handle up to 50 pounds . My panel is about 44 pounds and the vertical adjustment simply cannot handle the weight of the panel . I used the " heavy load " bolt that 's supposed to take care of this but it doesn't even come close . The TV doesn't just slip down a bit . It just sags against the wall . I can't imagine this mount could hold up a panel over 20 pounds without assistance . FWIW , the mount does feel sturdy and it can hold the panel securely . I 'm using a block of wood to offset the bottom of the panel from the wall . I 'll replace that with a V-shaped brace that acts as a cable guide and will let the horizontal swivel function of the wall mount to work properly . Also , the screws included with the mount were too small . They didn't fit my TV and the screw heads were so small , they slipped through the larger 100mm mounting holes . The lag bolts provided had little hex heads meant to be tightened with the included allen wrench . Terrible . Who wants to screw nearly 3 inches of bolt into a stud with an allen wrench ? ! ? I replaced them with 5/16x3 " lag bolts and used a socket wrench . I understand they 're trying to make a simple installation but there 's no way to get around the fact that the holes for the mount need to be drilled into the stud . Anyone who has a drill will have a proper set of wrenches for driving proper bolts . I only gave this two stars because , after a trip to the store for proper screws , and with the addition of a bracket to provide the proper offset , this mount seems like it will hold my TV off the floor and allow me to swivel it from side to side . However , I wouldn't recomment this product for any panel over 15 pounds . 20 tops .  
2	  I have owned this product for about two weeks or so . The first few times I was out in traffic , I really thought it was broken because it very rarely did anything ! . I called whistler about it because I thought it was broken . The very infomative support person I talked to said It sounds like it is working ok . and that I would be suprised how many patrol cars do not use there radar . so I should try it for awhile first then If I am not happy send it to them . Well this AM I got into my car and turned it on in my driveway . it started going off ! I turned down the road the beeping went to a higher and higher # on the scale . about a mile down the road was a patrol car sitting in a school zone it then regged a 9 on the scale . So I am so pleased to say I love this product It does not seem to give alot of false alerts like other products on the market .  
2	  What can you say about a cable ? I 've dragged mine all over the house , under , behind , and around furniture setting up a wireless network . The insulation has resisted nicks and tears and the connections are still good . No complaints .  
1	  I am a contractor who wears radio headphones all day when I work . When I received the headphones , I found them rather heavy and clunky , but the digital tuning and the presets were quite an improvement from what I had before and the sound quality was excellent . The next morning , I put them on and pushed the power button . Nothing . Nothing happened . I looked at the display and saw three battery icons blinking , telling me that the batteries were OK . I tried doing everything , pushing all buttons , removing and replacing the batteries , with no success . And the bloody battery icons kept blinking . So I changed the batteries , and the headset came to life . One hour later I turned off the headset to talk to someone . When pushed the power button .. nothing .. and there were the three battery icons blinking , blinking . Since then I have tried many times to make the thing come to life with no success .  
2	  I had been shopping for a new music player for a while ; I am a big fan of sony products , but I have a microsoft computer so after a lot of research I decided I would try this out . So far , so good ! Excellent price ( I purchased it refurbished ) and the seller sent new headphones which was very nice . The software took a little while to download but I think it works great . The only complaint I have for this device is that you have to search for the artist in the software or else it comes up as & # 34 ; Unknown Artist & # 34 ; on the player which is one of my pet peeves when it comes to mp3 players . It 's not hard to fix though ! And SO much music fits on this - it may not be the newest mp3 player available , but the sound quality and storage space make it totally worth it . One of the things that sold me on this product is that one of my friends told me she has had this exact same zune for 5 years with no problems ! So I would definitely recommend this to anyone who isn't too picky about style or wants to have the newest technology , and wants to have something that holds a lot of music and is easy to control .  
1	  As stated on the packaging , this " 3.5 to 3.5 Male Cable Extends to 2.5 feet of Cable Length " - NOT 6 feet . Buyer Beware !  
2	  This Mower is amazing . We only have a small , very small front yard to mow . This mower is lightweight , easy to push , and will not strain you . We enjoy it so much that we are going to take it over to a friends yard and use it on his and let him use it . If he likes it he is planning on purchasing one . This is a great start in going green !  
2	  After trying the Bose Triports ( and returning them within 24 hours ) I was thankful enough to come across these V-Moda earbuds . These have to be one of the best sets of headphones I have ever owned . The sound quality and durable design of this product speaks for itself . I have yet to find a pair of earbuds that can even come close to these .  
1	  Doesn't work . Tried using it with Real Player to play videos while I am on the treadmill . Would not work . Tried with iTunes .. same result .  
1	  well , let 's just says i didn't expect much and that is exactly what i got . the speakers arrived on time and in good condition . them sound like they are in a deep well ( it is almost frightening ) you get what you pay for so next time i 'll pay more for the polk audio rm7 . they do play sound however scratchy and muffled it maybe  
2	  This cable is fantastic . I used the entire box in 50-100 ft runs . It came out of the box smoothly ( the box uses a real abs / pvc spindle ) , and the pairs separated quite easily . The colors are bright and apparent . When un-twisted , they line up or stay in position just they way you want them . After a bad experience of copperclad cable , I did use my utility knife to scrape some of the copper , and it is indeed solid , through and through . The cable slid effortlessly through a typical snarled maze of potential snags in a drop ceiling environment . Every run was 100 % problem-free . Based on this experience - I will be purchasing a 1000ft roll of this same product .  
1	  I bought this toy last Christmas for my then 9 year old daughter . She loved it but was frustrated that its recording time / photo capacity is so small and the quality of the picture is sub-par . It eats batteries like crazy and inexplicably just stopped working after a few months . Much too expensive for the actual quality , especially when you can buy a real digital hand cam now for a few hundred dollars . If this toy had cost around $ 30.00 I would have given it a great review .  
1	  I picked up one of these before a road trip though the midwest along with a car and house adaptors . I was attracted to the programming choices and lack of commercials . The service is great on a road trip far away from any major cities . I find I listen to the docked unit all day at work too . First the good points . The display is excellent . Shows up well in any lighting conditions . A real plus in a moving vehicle . It 's easy to " program " and as I 've read in other reviews the service is real good about using the same artist and song titles on all of the streams . This means that if you program it to alert you when a song comes on it will find it spelled the same whenever it plays . The terrestrial repeaters are great around a city where buildings can block signals . I 'm able to leave the antenna on the dash instead of the roof . The so so points . The audio quality through the FM transmitter is not impressive . There are only four frequencies to choose from and it turns out that in my city all of them have strong broadcast stations which sometimes bleed through . The bad points . This thing runs hot and is not small , about the size of a large paper back book . So moving it between your car and house / office requires a bag . Also the display on mine got scratched right away . I found that this device trips off my radar detector and interferes with UHF two way radios such as ham / FRS / GMRS . I suspect that the antenna system is bleeding lots of RF . The cradle is difficult to set the unit into . Has a very vague feeling to it . After about five months of moving it between car and office the antenna connector on the back of the received got damaged by the cradle . Now whenever I move it I need to use a tool to bend the connector back into place otherwise it won't seat properly an the antenna won't make contact . The range on the remote is only about four feet . Not enough for the home user . I think in the future I 'll look for an audio system with a permanent built in satellite receiver . Then I can leave this one in the home dock and stop moving it .  
1	  We purchased the first PDR-M25 on 5/16 . It lasted for 31 days , and then it would not turn on . Toshiba exchanged it for another camera ( same model ) . When the replacement came , it would NOT take a picture when it first came out of the box . Then it took a few pictures , and then seized up again and the shutter button would not work . Toshiba sent another camera , same model , and it lasted 61 days before it refused to focus properly and the flash got out of sync with the shutter . I am awaiting camera # 4 , as Toshiba refused to send my money back .  
1	  The smell .. it was like poison .. went in the garbage ? .. do not recommend .. the smell burn your nostrils .. No goodThanks ! Had to buy a different lock wich was considerable much better  
1	  The filter cam in a open package and the filter was dirty needing to be cleaned before use . I actually decided to through it out .  
1	  They didn't send me 3.5mm Stereo Male To 2 RCA Male Cable 5 ft . I got 3.5mm Stereo Plug to 3.5mm Stereo Plug 12ft .  
1	  Prints well , when all the heads are clean , however , and it will burn through vast amounts of ink to clean . If you haven & # 8217 ; t smashed your 820 out of frustration yet , buy compatible ink off the Internet , not brand ink . It is just as good and a fraction of the price . You & # 8217 ; ll also sleep better knowing Epson & # 8217 ; s not sticking it to you a second time !  
1	  This is one of Logitech 's cheapest wireless desktop items , and the quality shows it . The keyboard is functional , but the keys sometimes feel a bit squishy and less than responsive . The media keys are cheaply-made , and some of mine are already loose even though I 've hardly used them . The mouse is by far the worst mouse I have ever used : it feels sluggish , is not particularly ergonomic , and worst of all , both buttons squeak with each click . I suspect this last part has to do with a badly designed battery holder , which seems to grind against the inside of the casing whenever the buttons are clicked . In terms of overall bang for your buck , it 's not much buck , but even less bang . I 'd suggest one of their higher-end products if you want to go with the wireless desktop .  
2	  No cradle , but uses a STANDARD miniusb cable .. same one as my Intel mp3 player and olympus digicam in fact . Even charges via usb ( though slower than witht the included ac adapter , ) not bad at all . Bye-bye to my cradles . Gorgeous screen , very high resolution is easy on my eyes . Still fits in my pocket like the M505 , with my wallet :) Comes with tons of great software , had no trouble with word , excel , powerpoint , videos , pictures , ( stuff beyond what I even want this organizer for . ) All my old info imported without a hitch , right from Outlook . Versamail works fine , even sees my exchange server , etc . Doesn't crash like some people said - as long as you spend the time to properly set it up ! The screen is ultra-sensitive .. barely needs a tap . Even comes with a screen protector ( that plastic film . ) Body is made of metallic plastic like the IPaq .. looks shiny like a mirror , and seems durable ( not like the cheap paint on phones . ) Very classy looking left-folding cover to protect the screen when it 's in your pocket . Down-button is a little hard to push . oh well . I use this for the calendar , appointments , contacts , and foreign dictionaries ( they run a lot faster on the internal memory now .. don't need the SD card . ) UPDATE : Just put in a ton of mp3s on an SD card and this thing is amazing . It can even drive my Sennheiser HD-580 headphones =) ( Yes it 's a STANDARD 3.5mm plug ! )  
1	  The brightness channel on the cable I recieved is malfunctioning . does not work ! do not buy .  
2	  This typewriter is used in a law office mostly for filling in forms and typing labels . It seems to do it 's job well and is very similar to one I owned previously . My secretary 's primary complaint is that it doesn't come with a daisy wheel that allows you to change the size of the print - you need to purchase a different daisy wheel in order to do this . Sometimes the size of the type doesn't easily fit into the forms she uses in the office . Other than that , she 's very pleased by the LCD display and 70,000 word dictionary . Though it 's not a rugged , heavy , metal typewriter like you might see from years ago , it 's plastic pieces are far outweighed by it 's bells and whistles . Recommended .  
2	  I have just read every review and comment on this product and I am a little worried . I spent my whole Friday night last night on Long Island ( I live in the Bronx , NY ) , replacing a Linksys BEFW11S4 v . 4 with an FM114P . I had to foot my own money for the replacement because I am the consultant who went with the Linksys in the first place . I also had to pay for my travel out there . I also have recommended similar Netgear units to other clients , namely the FR114P ( non-wireless ) . In effect I 've spent or gotten other people to spend a lot of money on Netgear hardware . I think I have something to say that Netgear needs to listen to . 1 ) There 's a hole in the ground where the natural resources for your product come from . If you are going to use steel , paper , plastic , and other metals to build something , don't squander those materials building junk . 2 ) Please respect people 's time . After all , it is time out of lives that we spend trying to get your products to do what we need . ( Research time counts too , so your website makes a huge difference . ) 3 ) Please note that there are a lot of people like me , who when time comes to spend our money or do our job , we want to get the most out of it . I genuinely like your routers because they are smarter than the rest of the stuff out there ( though built-in diagnostics and config backups are becoming more common ) . Linksys annoys the hell out me . They make routers that can't give me a heads up with a simple e-mailing of the log , they make routers that can't be mounted on a wall ( I do a lot of closet installations ) unless I drill a whole in the legs and void the warranty . Yes , I could * order * their mounting plate , but I am adamant about respecting natural resourses . The less junk and packaging the better . Now onto performance and other design comments . Your website is very helpful and easy to navigate . Your website helped me locate your products at a CompUSA where I could just walk in and it for that days work . No online ordering and no hassle waiting and scheduling . Thanks . The frequent firmware release online are a boon . It shows us that you support your product post purchase . The wireless funtion of this router does not let me see what machines are connected to * it * . I have another wireless access point and I 'd like to make sure which WAP is servicing which machine . I can get a little info with Netstumbler , but you should enable client management features . Troubleshooting a wireless connection or lack thereof needs this feauture desperately , as does the SECURITY aspect of knowing how many and what machines are on your wireless network . Thanks for the generous memory on the unit . But how much is used to process print jobs and how much is used for routing ? I imagine it is used for the task at hand as needed , but that 's my guess . Of course the print server is a great boon . I replaced an older external HP Jetdirect EX Plus ( J2591A ) , so I was a little worried about a clunky third party software printer port that would make WindeXP crop out . It worked fine on WindeXP Pro and Windows Meep machines . I did forget to go into the port properties and change the IP address of the Port * after * changing the default IP of the FM114P.Your newer units have auto MDI-MDX . Yes , we complain about wanting solid devices but we don't stop asking for features . But that little button can cause trouble if a user picks up the unit and toggles it inadvertently . I know not to do that , but the lady on Long Island does not . Dump the switch , please . If this thing is indeed burning out due to overheating , then you guys and gals have totally ignored one of the basic tenets of computer hardware design . Please put heatshinks or a fan in your units . Don't get your great product bad mouthed on Amazon because you got sloppy . The rule about heat is : if you can't keep your finger on a chip for 30 seconds , but a sink or a fan on it . Please . I don't want to go to Long Island , it 's too far . And I don't feel like opening up the unit and modding it . It 's not fair to me or respectful of my time .  
1	  I am only writing this review because anyone who buys this particular laptop do so at your own peril . I bought this laptop in 2005 . After a few months it ran so hot it melted my dsl connector . The plastic shriveled up around whatever was inside . I called tech service and they suggested it was somehow my dsl jack . However my power connector was hot enough that it would burn you if you touched it . I called again alerting tech service I considered it a fire hazard .. another oh well . The laptop itself was setting on a cooling pad otherwise it could not sit on your lap . Just after a year I started getting vertical lines on my screen . One at a time . I called again . Now the warranty was up and another OH WELL . Then I started a search only to find out this was a fairly common problem . The solution offered by HP Service was you could buy another monitor $ 200.00 but oh gosh since the problem apparently was the heating up problem those also went belly up because the real issue was not admitted to or ever resolved by HP . People with the problem determined it was the heat melting the chips loose on the video card which caused either the vertical or horizontal lines on the monitor . Had I not had the screen issue the computer itself was kick ass and I loved it . That was the last HP product I purchased because the service was so lousy . That computer when new cost me close to $ 2200 . I bought nothing but HP before that . To bad their loss . Dell is now my product of choice . Today I am connecting that laptop up to make my HDTV internet connected . Hooked to a 46 " HDTV that now will be a DVR back up as well allow me to watch internet programing on my TV . Nice to find something I can help recover the cost of a lousy HP product :)  
2	  I really don't know what those guys are talking about , I got this sub and I put it on my 600 watt kenwood surround sound amp with an rca cable . I turned that sucker on and i was amazed by how good the sound was coming from it . And it is ten inch you can't really beat that fot the price you would have to spend like 300 to 700 dollars for a ten inch anywhere else . plus it sounds as good if not better than half of the big names . I had a yamaha sub and this kills it for the sound part and looks . Plus the yamaha broke . So if you have a amp with a sub rca jack in the back i recommend this sub . but if you have a mini system don't get it . but i recomend this sub .  
1	  The screen is not visible if there is any sunlight or glare . A website just compared all GPS units on terms visibility , and this one came in dead last . The maps are the worst out there for the United States . Unlike their competition , TomTom does not use Navateq maps . Not nearly as many POIs , and the maps are incomplete and in error . The unit itself is simple to operate and gets the GPS signal quickly . However , this unit has a poor display and the worst maps on the market . And the mount isn't very good either .  
1	  Yeah , well at first I was excited about the keyoard , the way it looked and the fact that it was wireless , but I have had problems from day one . The batteries last ok , and the set up was not very difficult , but there is a sequence of keys that causes the Logitech website to pop up in the middle of your work causing you to lose EVERYTHING > I used to type really fast ans when I made a mistake I would go back and fix just as fast , but without knowing the sequence of keys that causes this problem , I have to be super careful and type at snails pace . It 's not the keys that are used to set up your internet keys , it 's soome other way .. It 's happende during long e-mails .. , gone .. buying products at checkout .. gone .. it really [ is frustrating ] .  
2	  This camera takes excellent photos at daylight and night . Its night mode is pretty Good but sometimes it gets a little fuzzy while taking indoor low light photos . IS is awesome and so are other options . But you cannot change settings such as aperture and other advanced settings ..  
1	  If you are looking for printer that is going to require a lot of maintaniance then buy this . So far I have owned this printer for 4 months and have spent approximately 20 hours on tech supporting this thing . When it works it is great but when it goes down be prepared .  
2	  The quality of the surge protector is good and the price is reasonable . It was shipped quickly too . The cord is not very long though .  
2	  I own these cables , they are perfect . People need to read the directions . Nobody seems to realize that each component tip loosens up if you twist it counter-clockwise . These component cables are threaded . Unscrew them , they slip right on to the connection , then tighten them back up by screwing them clockwise again . Ive used these for over a year now , and the quality is amazing .  
2	  Bought it from Eforcity at a cheap price . Got it within a week . Works great for capturing video from my camcorder to my laptop .  
2	  Very impressive 4x6 color photo prints ! They look even better than prints I get from standard film developers ( couldn't find any pixels off with magnification ) . It will be interesting to see how efficient it is on the use of 8 different ink tanks . The cost for the 8 pack of new ink isn't cheap , currently coming in at $ 75 . Data I have seen from test labs show the total cost per 4x6 color photo print at . 57 cents and that includes the paper ( ww . pcworld . com / reviews / article / 0 , aid , 119573 , pg , 6,00 . asp ) For basic every day printing you don't care about the quality on , it might make sense to keep another cheap printer around , but for home printing of photos you want to have a terrific memory of this printer does the job and so much more !  
1	  If you want to blast your neighbors out of their skulls , this is the system for you . The bass thumps even at the lowest setting . Play it at a reasonably mellow low volume , and you 'll notice how irritatingly tinny the satellite speakers are . People who complain , " no highs no lows , must be Bose " are dead wrong about this set . I say where is the mid range ? Where 's the mellow warm tones ? I hate what this does to my music ! Plus the speakers cut in and out . I 'm sending it back .  
2	  These are the best headphones I have owned . They stay in place and have clear sound as I run , my other type of headphones would fall out of my ears and I would have to constantly stop and put them back in , not with these I love them .  
2	  It 's fun to make your own greeting cards and this paper works great . I found the price to be very good , too !  
1	  If you have unlimited time to program or are willing to have someone do it for you ; If you have the patience to reboot at least once a week ; If you pay for an extended warranty ; If you understand that support is poor for the first year ; Then this is the remote for you . Fragile , frustrating , but works very well 90 % of the time . I 'll buy a 1100 to replace my 1000 , but I am not happy about it .  
1	  1 . Buttons are too small , some of which are not spaced apart very well ( very convenient for somebody waking up who can accidentally hit the wrong button ) . 2 . Buttons are labeled , organized , and layed out confusingly . For example , why not have an " alarm interface " which would include all of the alarm modes and features , and maybe a " radio interface " which would include all of the radio functions / settings . You would really understand how confusing this is if you were to actually go through the process of operating this alarm clock . But really , don't do it , make the smart choice . 3 . Too many features / modes . I understand some people prefer all of the different features , but I wanted a simple alarm clock with a buzzer / radio , and clock . Of course all of these special modes are set as the default , so it is a pain to try and configure all of the settings to a simple mode . So for those who want a simple alarm clock , definitely DO NOT GET THIS ! 4 . The button handling event is flawed . For example , sometimes when I push a button , it does not handle the event ( the device doesn't think that you pressed the button ) . So I would have to press the button again and check to see if the radio handled the button input correctly . 5 . It is very slow when holding the button down and waiting for the alarm clock to increment up and down . 6 . Radio reception is very poor . I have another radio right next to it that gets much better reception than this clock . 7 . LED is not very bright and hard to read from 10 feet and farther out . I have nothing against TIMEX ( they make great watches ) . This was written to protect anyone who who does not want to waste $ 30 .  
1	  This strap might have been a lot more comfortable if they re-styled it a bit . The place where the neoprene joins with the strap is very bulky and hit me right on the collar bone . So my neck was happy , but it chafed so much on my collar bone that I had to take it off in minutes . I think the neoprene should have been longer and the side straps shorter . Also , the neoprene is very thick and bulky-much thicker than it appears on the photo . Don't buy this unless you have a lot of room in your camera case to put it .  
2	  I needed a VCR for a rental property I own . I wanted something low cost , easy to use , that would hold up . I have had no compliants and it is holding up to a various people using it .  
1	  The VGA connector is NOT male but female . So I could not use this cable to directly connect my video card DVI output to my monitor vga input and still have to use a clunky 2 part contraption . :-(  
1	  I inserted batteries and took four pictures . The camera would no longer work . I went to the battery store and bought new batteries specifically for a digital camera . It would still not even turn on .  
1	  The first indication that something was wrong with this product was the price . It was " marked down " from $ 211.99 to $ 3.50 . Who in the right mind would believe that this Walkman CD carrying case would " orginally " cost $ 211.99 ? Guess " soneone " thinks there are a lot of gullible people in the world . After reading the reviews , I decided the case is probably selling for $ 3.50 because it is useless and Sony is trying to dump the product to get rid of it . This case looks a lot like the one I own which is worn out but mine has a flap opening not a zipper . I made my decision NOT to purchase this item after reading the reviews . I just bought a Sony CD Walkman D-NF340 MP3 player and wanted a new case for it . Guess I will keep shopping . One would assume Sony Walkman CD players are the same size , so why wouldn't Sony make a belted pouch that FIT their CD players ?  
1	  This works ok but my onw quam is that it will now work woth my i paq 5455 on 802.11b . It seems to have some issues there . It is a known bug . that some b equipnment may not work with it . htere are some people that hacked it to make it b only and the stuff works , but that is not a normal option in the menu .  
2	  I bought this product a while back and it has yet to dissapoint . Great value for your money , by the far the best and most resistent external hardrive . Once you get it , you won't need anything else .  
2	  My tv was a USED one , and it is in very good shape .. NEW it cost $ 329 , but I got mine for $ 120 .. some other brands are a lot less costly , and are ( probably ) just as good . I would NOT have bought a brand new one for that amount of money .. BUT , This brand may last longer , but I don't know about that yet .  
2	  Hooked up the optical cable from my A / V to my DVD and the sound is awesome . Optical digital cables do not use copper to transmit data , but pulses of light . Since there is no interference , the signal does not degrade over long distances and it does not weaken . With optical digital cables , you can get one of the best reproductions of digital signals available .  
1	  We placed this POE switch into service in June of 2010 . It ran 24/7 and died on April 26 , 2012 . We didn't even get 2 years out of it . I don't think we will miss it though , because the fan was very loud . We bought a replacement for about half the price , and it features 8 gigabit ports instead of just 2 that came with the Linksys . To be fair , the Linksys had a couple of port connections that the new switch does not have , but we didn't use them anyway . Generally , we 've had decent luck with Linksys stuff in the past , and I would buy Linksys products again . With only 2 gigabit ports , and a lifespan of less than 2 years , I think this particular switch is overpriced garbage .  
1	  I purchased this item from a local retail store ( the only brand they had on the shelf ) and I was disappointed to find it makes an audible " Clack Clack " noise , due to plastic parts rattling around during operation . I used it for several months until it eventually got a short in the wire , just above the headphone jack , under minimal wear and tear . Obviously I don't recommend this item , and I would advise against getting most white electronics for your car because they turn noticeably yellow in the sun .  
2	  definitely a must have if you want a quality DVD burner thats low budget and still works great . Havent had any problems whatsoever .  
1	  I was looking for a new charger set for my iPhone . This set simply did not work . - The 12v vehicle adapter was loose and came unplugged very easily-The fuse ended up shorting out , sparking and catching on fire in my vehicle , melting the 12v adapter-The AC plug / wall adpater would not continue charging once the phone entered sleep modeBuy a better quality unit , do not waste your money  
2	  I have a Canon Power Shot A 620 digital camera and it is 7.1 mega pixels . This card ( SanDisk SDSDH-1024-901 1 GB Ultra II Secure Digital Memory Card ) lets me shoot 515 pictures , at best image . I have not tried Video yet , so I can't tell you how much Video , this card will hold ( I have a Digital Mini DV recorder I use for that ) . The speed seems fine to me , and its been 100 % reliable so far . I have two 1 GIG cards and that 's pretty much all I need for vacations , family shots etc . ,  
2	  I 've had Canon printers using this cartridge for more than a year and won't settle for any of those knock-offs . Yeah , they 're often much cheaper , but this is one area where you get what you pay for . Brand X fades and does not perform as well in the inkjet system . This has been confirmed in independent lab tests in a leading PC magazine . I have had to install and remove countless cartridges and NEVER spilled a drop . The pop-in , pop-out design couldn't be easier .  
2	  I had an Epson 785EPX photo printer and when it worked , the prints were beautiful . However , my printer heads were constantly clogging and I wasted tons of ink cleaning the heads all the time . The ink is not cheap . So , I started researching for a new photo printer . I chose the Canon line because they have a reputation for cheaper ink . I found this to be true when I purchased the Canon i250 to replace another Epson ink hog ( the 640 ) for my general printing . ( I keep one printer for general printing , one for photos ) The Canon ink cartridges ARE cheaper and last longer . After reading reviews on photo printers I decided between the Canon ip4000 and the ip6000d . The ip4000 got amazing reviews both from consumers and magazines . There weren't a lot of reviews on the ip6000d I suppose because it 's newer . I decided to risk buying the ip6000d anyways because I really wanted the media input slot for convenience . I 'm here to say the photos are AMAZING and of photo lab quality . I tested using the included Canon Photo Paper Pro and also my leftover Epson Premium Photo Glossy Paper . Both papers produced the same results . The printer unpacked and installed easily . For printing without the computer , the menu / LCD screen on the printer is intuitive and easy to use . For printing through the computer , the software program ' Easy Photo-Print ' stands by it 's name . A couple of mouse clicks and the perfect print came out . If it matters , my digital camera is a Kodak DX6490 . There are two things to watch for while setting up your ip6000d for the first time . Both have to do with loading paper into the cassette tray . Make sure you load the paper PRINT SIDE DOWN and watch out for the little plastic thingy that holds the paper in place . Mine broke off and the spring flew off who knows where . It still works but just moves around easily . Since I just got the printer today I can't comment on long term use or ink usage for sure . I 've printed about 10 4X6 's so far and 3 of the 6 tanks show a very slim line for usage .  
1	  bought this product to assist connect ipod shuffle 2G with docking station , however the ipod does not fit on the product - due to poor design of the product . makes the product a useless buy - waste of money . Kuljit  
1	  Even coming with three sizes of of " ear gasket " , using the smallest I 'm afraid these headpohones still don't fit comfortably , and the ' seal ' it creates on the ear is terrible . If you work out and sweat , it becomes even more atrocious , and as you adjust the headphones , the gaskets slip out of place ; they 're keyed to the headphone , but they don't stay in place . I am fairly dissatisfied with these In Ear headphones , and would not recommend them to anyone .  
2	  There are many screen cleaner cloths out there ( microfiber , disposable , etc . ) , why spend $ 10 on this chamois product ? Because it works and it lasts very well ! I bought my first one of these in 2005 and just recently bought another to use only on my large screen TV . The Klear Kloth weathers VERY well , the edges of the cloth are stitched so it doesn't fray . It is washable . Show me another product in this class that lasts 6 years and is still going strong . I use the Klear Chamois Kloth to clean my laptop , my desktop monitor , my GPS screen , phone screens , etc .. pretty much anything electronic related that I want to be careful with , I trust this product . It is a nice large size , so it makes cleaning large computer monitors easy and also works well on large screen TVs . My philosophy when buying anything is .. even a simple cloth to clean screens .. if I can spend a bit of time and find the best a high quality product that lasts , and does its job ( mainly to clean and not damage my expensive equipment ) , then it is time well spent . I 've spent the time looking for you .. this is the product I recommend and think that you will want .  
2	  I have researched this brand a little . Most people say the brand of disk doesn't matter . This seems like a cheap brand ( from CMC also the makers of Hotan disks-supposedly the same disk-different " brand " ) but all 100 of mine worked without a hitch . I am writing this review because of my experience with Pioneer brand cd-r 's . I tested the first 5 in a spindle of 50 and only 2 of the Pioneer 's worked . When my burner spit them out I stuck one of these in and the burner said tastes great ! Added bonus-they look more sleek on the top of the disk than any other blank disk I have seen . Highly recommended , especially with royalties driving up all cd-r prices ( see pccomputing . com for article : " cd-r prices tripling " ) .  
2	  For you Mac users out there , this is a great printer to hook up to your Airport Express or Extreme . Works without a hitch . I finally replaced my hardwired HP 5MP workhorse with this Brother , and couldn't be happier . It prints pages very , very quickly ( faster than my HP ) , and the price is perfect .  
1	  I 've owned multiple Palm devices and , with the exception of the oldest technology , have ended up with problems will all of them and found at times that they were limited in their ability to do the things I wanted . So , I eventually decided to move to a Pocket PC . After reading some reviews , I came across the Toshiba Pocket PC e740 which was leading edge technology at the time . Unfortunately , the reviwers who point out that the design of this device is less than perfect are absolutely correct . This is especially true of button positions and battery life . Data loss due to the record button or on button being inadvertantly pressed for long periods of time while in an airline overhead bin is becoming common for me . Smarter button positioning would easily eliminate this problem . I 've also noticed the batteries drain remarkably quickly , allowing for only an hour or so of work before they need recharging . This is hardly useful on a 7 hour flight over the Atlantic . If you travel a lot , I 'd look to other devices which have better design and better battery life .  
1	  Just a quick note how deeply dissapointed we were with the pictures after returning from our holidays , for which we bought the camera . Using only full automatic mode , pictures taken on sunny days outdoors were TERRIBLY , AWFULLY PALE . They were so bad that only a few could be rescued by computer software , by adjusting contrast . Most , 90 % were wasted . VERY VERY VERY dissapointed .  
1	  Don't be seduced by the cool package . The camera is poorly made . The shutter button and battery compartment door both broke within a few days . It eats batteries if you try and use the flash . The picture quality is poor , but might charming for a toy , if it didn't break , and didn't cost so much . Shame on Kids Station for trying to pass off a piece of junk like this .  
2	  ok guys , if you want to be ahead of trend this is for you , it has tiny problems to match its tiny size , . not great indoors because it loves light . but outdoors . this is a delight .. you drop in in your purse , or slip in in a back pocket . noone even knows you taking a picture because noone would ever know it is a camera in your hand . how cool is that . everyone will ask you where did you get it ? lol you feel like you are james bond at every event . i have a mac and it does not download but my husband has a pc he just forwards them to me .. for the money and the size this camera is tops . it is the camera you will never forget whereever you go . if you are taking along your credit card then you can fit this . i just love it ..  
1	  This M type XD card was not compatible for my olympus camera . a waste of money . make sure you check your cameras compatibility with these cards .  
2	  Best printer I 've owned . Fast , quiet , excellent print quality . Delivery was fast . I read an earlier review from a person who had difficulty , but I experienced no delay at all . Highly recommend for purchase .  
1	  I had this router for several years in a small apartment . Had many problems with dropped connections and router needing to be power cycled . Replaced it with aLinksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router ( Compatible with Linux ) with firmware upgraded to DD-WRT which performs flawlessly . I regret spending so much time and effort trying to get the Netgear WGR614 to work reliably .  
1	  Normally in a review about a cable I would mention something about picture quality and sound . However , these cables never even got me that far . The cable fit nice and smooth into the back of my ps2 . The problem was trying to get the inputs the back of the tv . Simply stated , they were not the right size . I tried shoving the first 2 into the component inputs and with great force they somewhat wiggled in . I started on my 3rd and then decided to stop because it wasn't worth the risk of breaking my tv . How a company like Monster can make a set of cables that do not correctly fit into a standard sized input is ridiculous . Do not buy these cables . Obviously some people have gotten them to work , but I read about two other people having this problem , and some people having a problem on the other end of the cord where the plug goes into the ps2 . It is just not worth it . Buy the component cable that is approved by Sony .  
1	  Their warranty has strict regulation so I couldn't get my item repaird depite that the item broke in 1 year when the warranty is 2-yrs . it wowed me at first since the sound was clear but i was very dissapointed that the item broke so easily and the company wouldn't repair it for me . to fix it , they wanted to charge me $ 68 even when my product was still under warranty . not worth it .  
1	  i recieved my pool with its box totally trashed .. the handle that fits into the skimmer was bent and could not fit the accessories that comes with it . after filling up the pool , i found out that the pump was not working . i called customer service and told me that i had to send my receipt and fill up an application that they sent me , and fax it back to them . i did that and it will take about 48 hours before they actually get the fax to the right agent . after that it takes about 5-7 business days to send you a new one . i am still waiting and hoping that my water will not turn green . i added chlorine tablets and hopefully this will keep it clean until my new pump arrive .  
1	  These recorders are the worst . I 've owned mine for about 3 years . And yes , they do make good quality DVDs but it is one of the hardest pieces of equipment I 've ever used . And , after 3 years the DVD burner just died . I guess I 'm one of the lucky ones because I 've heard of this problem happening much sooner for some . And , it 's near impossible to find a drive to replace it . Buy this if you want but you 'll come to hate it in the end like I did .  
1	  Extremely difficult to remove from a device . It requires so much of an effort the it seems like it is going to damage the device it is attached to !  
2	  I purchased this a few months ago specifically for on-hill ski photos . I spend most winter weekends with a bunch of ski racers , and shoot around 3,000 images in a weekend . Swapping lenses on the course is a really bad idea ( lens and camera guts do not mix well with snow , ) so I needed a good way to carry the camera / 200mm lens . This is the best investment I 've made in a camera bag . I 'm not saying that if I take a header down the hill or if I kiss a tree the bag will save the camera - only a hard case would do that . But it does keep the camera safe from minor falls , keeps it warm ( there 's plenty of space to add heat packs ) - and dry . There 's a cover that pulls out of a small pouch that acts as a rain poncho for the bag , making it darn near water proof ! The outside pockets hold extra batteries and CF cards . It also supports the lowepro harness system - I 'm looking into that for this bag and other lowepro bags I own . Update : This winter ( Jan 2010 ) I DID take a header down the hill - 25 foot tumble followed by a 50 foot slide at Marquette Mountain . Camera and lens : undamaged .  
2	  I am very satisfied with the Sharp Aquos I purchased from LCD Mart through Amazon . I received the product on time and in great condition . I received a follow up call to see if everything was in order .  
2	  This thing was worth every single penny period . It is very loud , and it has many great features . I love that it has an HDMI output , it really helps in up converting standard definition DVDs . This thing has other great features , such as an Auxiliary input , Ipod dock , and USB port . The remote is easy to use and has a great layout . All of the speakers are labeled , and the wires are colour coded , so anyone can set it up without any problems . If you are looking for an all in one box set up , this is it . 11 months later I can honestly say , I would buy this again without hesitation .  
1	  A good starter camera . If you never used a digital camera before this one is for you . Easer to operate then a film camera turn the dial to auto and snap away . I got it for our 8 year old she mastered it and was taking pictures in five minutes an older women relative who never even seen one before was Abel to master it in two . It doesn't have all the gadgets or settings that the others have but that is part of it 's appeal for older or younger picture takers . If you can use a film camera you can use this digital . You might even be able to use this one if you cant figure out a film camera . And it takes just as good a picture as most film cameras . In short if you have been scared to go digital because you don't think you can figure out how to use it this one is for you .  
1	  Before you buy this printer , be warned : YOU CANNOT PRINT BORDERLESS ON MATTE PAPER ! I print hundreds of matte pages a month on a Stylus Photo 820 .. and upgraded to the 2200 because of its touted matte ink capability . But once you put the matte cartridge in , you can't select border-free printing on the sides . And printing with the photo cartridge is indeed an inferior option , if you 're looking for crisp , sharp blacks on matte paper , so " fooling " the printer by saying you 're printing on photo paper doesn't work . I can only hope Epson is working on a driver update , as I 'm ready to send this printer back .  
2	  I bought this about 6 months ago . So far so good . It has worked on every computer I have plugged it into and has not failed me yet . It is small and easy to misplace . I have lost it 3 times in my house . If it had a built in password protection I would have given it 5 stars .  
1	  I was quite shocked at the poor performace of this radio / CD . I couldn't get any AM stations and only 3 FM stations . The FM radio stations were so scratch it was driving me crazy . The audio quality of the CD was very tinny and made it diffcult to hear the music . NO BASS at all and no tone controls at all .  
1	  This thing has given us problems from the start and of course with no help from their tech support . It 's so erratic that it won't print try after try but if you shut it off for a few days it might work after that .  
1	  No blocking equipment can be truly effective unless the live caller is required to enter a pin or password . Just a list of numbers permitted to call through makes it difficult to keep up with one time callers that you want to receive e.g. A delivery person whose number you will not know in advance .  
1	  Pros : Beautiful picture , adequate menu options , remote has reasonable button layout . Cons : Slow , takes about ten to twelve seconds to open the DVD tray after you hit the eject button . After working fine for ten months , it quit-just kept saying LOADING - LOADING - LOADING.I do electronics repair , so I opened the unit and found that the DVD spin motor had failed . This DVD player uses a RF-300F-12350 motor , which has a high failure rate . I can replace my motor for under $ 15 in about 10 minutes , but if you don't do your own small electronics repair , you may have to pay a repair shop $ 90 or more to get the unit fixed , which is more than what you might pay for a brand new DVD player .  
1	  What do you get someone who has everything ? Something they don't necessarily want . I got this as a gift . Nice idea , it will cycle through pictures and remind me of who gave the frame to me . Here 's the problem : If you overload the memory , the machine freezes . Aparently there is a firmware update , but I found out too late . The frame will not boot any longer and wont mount on my computer . ( part of the problem is that the manual to operate the frame comes on a CD , and the manual is NOT Mac compatible .. surprize the manual is not a pdf file ) . I had the same problem as the other reviewer , HOWEVER , I got better support . I got online , and their email and chat buttons were disabled , so I used their phone number I got from the web site . After navigating through the phone maze , I got a hold of a helpful agent . They are exchanging the frame . They are sending me a return box .  
1	  I was not happy with this buyer at all . He only gives you seven days to return a product . He does not guarantee the products . The product does not work in all three speeds , only in one and of course i did not find this out right away so my seven days were GONE ! I would not purchase another thing from this buyer !  
1	  As I sit here on hold for the past 15min for Lyra tech support , I have time to reminisce over the first call about 45min ago when the tech didn't even believe this model existed . A small smile touches my lips when I think of my coy little Lya RD2820 , too shy to FREAKIN WORK . This thing blew up like Hiroshima . I installed the software on my WinXP box , plugged it in , the Lyra screen showed a connection in progress and WinXP failed the plug & play . Since then , connected or not , my Lyra still thinks it 's connected and there is - no way to shut the damn thing off - . The power button doesn't work , the battery can't be removed . Needless to say it refuses to be recognized by any machine in my home now , XP or 2K . All the technicians right now are huddling in a little group figuring out if they have any tech skills between them . Isn't technology wonderful ?  
2	  I have always preferred " perked " coffee . However , after my old percolator died , I made the mistake of trying a couple of pour through coffee makers . Both of these died after just a few months of making average coffee that never seemed warm enough . The presto makes excellent coffee in a short time and keeps it HOT ! If you are in the market for a coffee maker , I strongly recommend this product . I shopped around a lot before this purchase and Amazon had the best price . This was exactly what I needed and of course it was shipped very quickly . I give Amazon and Presto five stars !  
1	  We thought we were getting a good deal with this LCD TV - it was refurbished and therefore well priced , but we paid an extra $ 200 for an extended warranty , which was to kick in after the Westinghouse 90-day warranty expired . Within the first week the remote control started acting up , and within two weeks the set wouldn't turn on at all . We had to send it back to Westinghouse * at our expense * ( $ 120 ) - that 's their policy ( and the extended warranty hadn't kicked in yet ) . About seven weeks later ( ? ! ) the new set arrived . We 're unpacking now , but not too excited . The set itself is OK , though when you change channels , there 's a half-second glitch that gets pretty annoying .  
2	  My default NIC for my Solaris 10 ( _ x86 , AMD Quad-core ) and works as expected . Solaris has already have driver installed .  
1	  I folowed the installation instructions to the letter , but my Windows XP Found New Hardware wizard pop-up stated : " There was a problem installing this hardware : USB Device . An error occurred during the installation of the device . Access is denied . " An e-mail inquiry to D-Link was not answered .  
1	  The only issue I had until about a week ago is that the cables they sell to go with this switch do not support DVI-D connections directly . You have to use a DVI-I to DVI-D adapter to plug them into the computer side ( DVI-D ports are very common on built in video , but much less common on stand alone video cards ) . It is not ideal but the converters are available pretty cheaply here and elsewhere so it is not a major issue . Then all the sudden it just broke one day while it wasn't in use . The USB just stopped working after about 2 years . So now I am back to moving cables between computers or having multiple mice . Given the high price of this switch , having to replace it every couple years is not acceptable . If it didn't break it would probably be 4 stars . Not perfect , but a decent option . But I can't recommend it as is .  
1	  Shuffle 1 GB and sleek design got it . itunes is absolutetly the worst thing ever . they keep telling me to upgrade and it never does what i want . Do you want to load a CD . No . Then it does anyway . Puts tracks in the wrong order . Impossible to manage . It actually got erased from my comp and when reinstalled itunes and loaded the shuffle into the USB it tells me I have to seek it with the current library , which is empty and everything gets erased . i got the shuffle for free but will never buy an apple product ever , let the rest of the lemmings look cool jumping off a bridge i 'm sticking to my cell mp3 .  
1	  If you 're going to spend this kind of money , then get something else . This TV 's sound is terrible . It works acceptably for routine network programs , but for stereo broadcasts and VCR / DVD playback , it reeks of dead skunk . You have to keep increasing the volume , which then serves to blur what you 're trying to hear , and people who are watching continually ask each other , " What did he say ? " For this price , far better products are available . I definitely wish I had not bought this one . And yes , the microscopic little buttons on the remote are a pain in the derriere too . This TV / DVD / VCR system looks a lot better on the department store floor than it functions in your home TV room . Don't waste your money or time with this thing .  
2	  cable works good , well built , no problems . the cheaper ones , that are white in color are not as well made .  
2	  Love this mouse . extremely accurate , well designed and in my opinion it 's the best in its class by a long shot . Although the batteries need to be swapped once a day , its a small 10 second ( max ) inconvenience when you consider the 2 other options ( software even alerts you before the battery goes dead ) . Those 2 other options are to either buy a corded mouse which gets annoying and limits future mobile options OR get a mouse that needs to be in a charging stand every night at the risk of forgetting and having NO use of it for hours . If and WHEN that happens you 'll WISH you spent a few extra $ ' s and got the G7 laser . Also with a permanent chargeable battery , once it no longer holds a charge you 'll have to buy a new mouse instead of just getting new battery packs . Having swappable batteries trades off all those long term negative issues for one minor and mindless 5-10 second swap out .. to me buying this mouse is a no brainer . ( only gave it a 4 stars because it doesnt have a " forward " button only a " back " button ) PS : I have had this mouse for just about a year now . PSS : It has quite a long range as well  
1	  We received the hard drive kit packed securely in a box . When opened we immediately noticed a rattle . The kit did not work . My suspicion was - it was packed not working - no apparent damage to packaging or product . We have since had to mail back to the manufacturer to get this situation resolved . Emails back and forth for the instructions to mail the drive back . We had to pick up the cost of postage , and still do not have a drive . This has been over a period of a month .  
1	  Died after one day . From then on , any DVD would spin up then give an error msg of " NO DVD " . This has been happening so much with players across the board , that it must be a cheap DVD unit source that the big names are purchasing from a developing country . Didn't enjoy the user-interface either . I use the fwd / rev slow motion type features to watch windsurfing videos . I found the user interface for these features on my old VCR to be much better than on this DVD player .  
1	  I purchased this card for my Samsung SMX-F40 Camcorder because it was recommended by the salesman . This combination is NOT COMPATIBLE . All I ever get is a card error message .  
1	  The CD function stopped working after a few months and the tuner is an absolute hair trigger - hitting it by accident closing the shower curtain this morning moved it more than 3MHz ! To avoid the problem the other reviewer notes concerning it falling , I untied one end of the rope that allows it to hang . I looped that around the shower curtain and retied it . That lets the cord act as a safety line for when the suction fails .  
2	  Got this cam since I am traveling a bit more these days for work and I want to see my family . Bought this for the quality and small travel size . Did not disappoint . The software is a bit useless ( I simply use AIM for video chat ) , as no one usese the Logitech proprietary software . Other than that , it works as advertised . Small , easy to set up , good quality . Recommended if you need a travel web cam .  
1	  I am a mid-level computer user who used this cable once and found the software confusing . If you have an external hard drive use it to transfer your data . A side note - Transferring from Windows XP to Vista computer is much more difficut than transferring from a Windows XP to Windows XP computer . Vista 's file structure is different and Outlook 2007 has its ' own problems - still not operating correctly - Outlook 2007 is using half the resources of a new Dell XPS M1710 . Hindsight being 20-20 ; if I could do this over , I 'd wait until the computer experts tell us it 's safe to jump into the Vista pool .  
2	  With 3 weeks under my belt with my new Canon Digital rebel XTi 10.1 MP SLR , I can only say I remain thrilled and happy with my purchase . With my last quality camera purchase being a Canon SLR in the early 70 's , I have been blown away by how " smart " this camera is and how easy to use . One can use it in automatic mode and not worry about the technical aspects , or go deep into manual customized photography . This camera is a great deal , and everything as advertised . Can't wait to add a zoom !  
2	  Found these on Amazon for a fraction of retail price - REFUSED to pay $ 30 for brand name color and black inkject ink ! Ordered and recvd in 4 days . I use these to print custom labels for DVDs and Blue Ray home movies and Boxing fights . They look and work excellent ! Why pay full price using brand name if these work every bit as good if not better ? Can't go wrong for the price . I highly recommend !  
1	  I bought this product a couple weeks ago and at first it seemed fine , but then I noticed that when it was turned on , the control wheel becomes uni-directional . What I mean by this is no matter which way you turn the wheel , the control only scrolls in one direction . This is OK , but frustrating , for some things like ISO and white balance , but it makes the exposure compensation wheel useless . It only moves in the negative direction and once it reaches -2 , it is stuck there and will not come back up . This is true whether using the control wheel on the camera or the one on the grip . I am hoping I can return it and if so , will spend the extra $ to get a Canon grip .  
1	  This is not intended for publication . But it seemed a way to express my disatisfaction : Though , the listing said that this adapter would be the correct one for our model of Casio keyboard , it absolutely was not and cost us a rehearsal . We ordered another , the correct one , through Guitar Center .  
2	  Needed to boost up my ram in an older PC ( Athlon XP 2400 ) . A noticeable difference in performance when going from 256mb to 2gb ! I wish my system could use the newer DDR tho ..  
1	  I had wanted to record my voice and make CDs of myeself and had baught the cheapest mic I could , which was this one . I had made a giant mistake , for when I played the recording of myeself I heard the voice of a three-year-old . To make an honest joke , this microphone is sexist , making the voice of a girl into the voice of a baby as though mocking our natural high-pitched voice . All joking aside , it may not have been sensitive enough to capture your unique voice as your unique voice , but it sure was quick to record background noises such as my breathing . This microphone is enough to make an optimist scream at its low quality . A more expensive microphone would be more expensive , but better worth the money than this one .  
2	  Well , It is just a piece of plastic , right ? Not exactly ! I bought the third party one from Precision Design which has nothing to do with precision . In fact , it does not fit well on the lens and never locks , I mean , it should lock on the lens when you turn it to the side . Canon charges a lot for its original hood and I definitely think that it should be supplied with the lens ! Acting like this , Canon is just playing too much tight . However , I confess that the Canon original lens hood for the 17-85mm lens is of far highest quality than the one from Precision design that I bought . I regret to have bought this third party hood . The Canon one fits perfectly on the lens and has a nice velvet coat inside that I think is intended to protect the lens against scratches . My advice ? Well , Pay more and get the one from Canon . It worths !  
2	  This product was so ridiculously cheap I was expecting to open the package and get a piece of licorice rope , but it was a real hdmi cable , and it works perfectly with my ps3 . $ 50 at radio shack , or a buck online .. hmm ..  
1	  Mine crapped out , 1 year and two months . I purchased a Samsung to replace it . I will take out the speakers for ham radio use and put the rest of it out for bulk waste collection . I hope there is some future legal compensation for this .  
1	  I bought these for my son and they stopped working a couple of months in ! When I called their so called customer service they said the cables had problems and the replacement for them are on back order . Yet , they continue to sell the Super . fi ! It has been over 4 months and I called again and was told they are still not available . DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY ! Do yourself a favor and buy the cheapies from Walmart , at least they will replace them ! THIS COMPANY STINKS !  
1	  Slow and flaky at the best of times , this router 's problems only increase when more computers attempt to join the wireless network . Once I had four wireless clients ( 2 mac & 2 PC ) things ground to a halt completely . The router would randomly stop responding and would need to be rebooted every few minutes . I 'm throwing this piece of junk out with the garbage and buying a Linksys .  
1	  Based on the info about the product - that it would accommodate 15 " to 40 " flat panel TVs , and was compatible with both VESA 100 and VESA 200 mounting hole arrangement on the TV - I purchased this for a Vizio 37 " LCD with VESA 100 mounting holes . It is very sturdy and rated for a maximum load of 130 lbs while my TV was less than 40 pounds . It certainly inspires confidence that your TV will be securely mounted as you pull it forward , angle it from side to side , and push it back . I read through the instructions and saw the adjustments available on the post with mounting plate for TVs of different heights . Unfortunately , not until I had drilled and mounted the shelf on my cabinet did I realize that the holes on the back of my TV were not centered vertically on the TV , but were closer to the top . This meant that there was much more of the TV below the holes . I needed 13.5 " from the lowest hole on the TV to the base of the TV . When the post with mounting plate on the pull out shelf was adjusted for the maximum height , it allowed only 12 ' inches from the lowest hole on the mounting plate to the base where the TV would be mounted . Therefore , the product was unusable as is for my TV . Fortunately , the Sanus customer service people , while verifying that there was no way to raise the mounting post higher , did work with me on the phone to find another adjustable mounting bracketSanus MT25-B1 Tilting Wall Mount for 26 " to 42 " Displayswhich would attach to the mounting post of the pull out shelf . Of course that was another $ 45 on Amazon , but it did allow me to mount the TV with no further difficulty . Bottom line , try to get some idea if you will be able to successfully mount your TV to this well made and thoroughly useful product before ordering it . You might need some other adapter if your TV is approaching the 40 " limit for this pull out shelf .  
2	  The size is convenient for a pocket , I like the battery end which gives my arthritic hand a " handle " to hold . I like the external controls because I don't want to be fiddling through an on-screen menu too much . If I want " advanced " settings , the menu is intuitive . I like that there is a viewfinder because it 's hard to see anything on a screen in bright light . There is a difference in what is pictured in the viewfinder vs . screen . I wanted in an emergency to be able to pick up batteries in any country , so I like the AA battery-use . It goes through these quickly , and seems to drain battery power when off . I haven't tried a li-AA battery but I use rechargeable AAs and am recharging them often . For the mid 150s price , I am happy . I did not buy extended protection . It didn't seem like a good investment .  
2	  Printer is not adequate description . Does a lot more , especially scanning . Copying is amazing . Been easy to use , software support is great , have used scan feature with little or no problems , copy ok but watch settings , got 5 by 7 copies when wanted full page . Only just scrateched the surface making ( copying ) stuff onto photo paper . Scanned docs into pdf format , little trouble e-mailing readable docs but pdf works great . Except for cost of ink , great unit .  
2	  What can I say ? It works as advertised in my home-office environment .. which is maybe a huge compliment these days . I have an 8-port Linksys BEFSR81 router that I 've used for many years but needed more ports and wireless for laptops . One caveat .. If you are adding it as a second router like I did , there isn't a lot of documentation on the web ( and none included with the product ) for how to hook them in so everything can see everything else . The fundamental secret is to do something that is not really intuitive to non-experts .. plug the connecting ethernet cable into a regular , numbered , LAN port on ON BOTH routers . Plug your cable or DSL modem into the " Internet " port on the WRT54GL . This leaves the " Internet " port on the old router unused . By doing this , you haved " bridged " the two units and bypassed the " routing " functionality thus making all of the computers connected to both routers appear as if they were connected to one large one ( they are on the same " LAN segment " ) .  
2	  It works ! It holds a great amount of photos for my compact Fuji camera . Never had an issue with it not working or slow writing .  
2	  The Casio Exilim 770 requires high-speed flash when used to record movies . The Ultra II seems to work flawlessly .  
2	  My Canon Vixia HD came with a free case , until last week I thought it was sufficient . I took it to an event and in the minor hustle and bustle , the zipper tore off , and the seams busted , leaving my expensive equipment exposed to loss and damage . I was looking for a reasonably-priced alternative , preferably something with a name-brand , and found this one from Canon . With Amazon Prime ( Student ) I received it for free in 2 days and I can't say enough good things about the product . The zippers are thick , heavy , and the seams are strong . The vinyl is thick , the case has great external support so it can handle weight and even pointed-pressure coming at it . The name logo isn't over-stated , the internal padding is flexible , and there are 3 adjustable internal sections and several web-pockets as shown . Despite all this , the case isn't too heavy and the strap is padded , coated in non-slip rubber of some sort , and has two separate length adjustments . The pictures don't highlight the waist-strap that is tucked away and buttoned in place behind the unit for extra security & stability . This bag will most certainly holdup for years to come . All of this , for $ 30 .  
2	  Awesomely fast , nice and practical . a lot of data at your thumb . Buy one and you won't regret . Nothing can go wrong when you purchase from Amazon .  
2	  I can say that this is the best that u can get at a lower price .. It is exoensive if u buy at outlets .. Really cheap .. Go for it for any camera 's or any battery operated items as it charger both AA and AA batteries ..  
2	  I purchased this phone used because I managed to break my Plantronics CT-10 which I loved .. okay maybe that 's a strong word , but I liked it a lot . At the time , I did conference calls at night about 1-2 hours in length about 2-3 times a week . For the most part , sound quality , distance from the base unit reception , battery life were all comparable to the CT-10 . But there were 3 things this unit that made this unit not as good as the CT-10 . WEIRD EFFECT ON MY WIRELESS LAPTOP : I know nothing about radio frequencies or such , but the minute I would turn on this head set to make a call near my wireless Dell laptop , my laptop would lose the wireless signal . Once the phone was off , it was fine . This wasn't a fluke but quite repeatable , as it fascinated me . My house cordless phone did not have this effect . NO AUDIBLE MUTE INDICATOR AND A FUSSY MUTE BUTTON : When you are on a conference call for a long time , you get up and wander , sometimes you cough or want to blow your nose and knowing you are on mute is essential . On this unit I had to look at it to tell and with it 's black on gray display it was only visible in well lit areas . The CT-10 ( since it had no display ) had a high pitch beep you would hear in the background to tell if you were on mute . Mind you I 'm sure some found it annoying , but I would have liked to have the option to have that on . On top of that , to get mute , you had to hold the button to get it to go on . It was after another feature , that I did not use . PASSIVE CLIP : The clip on this unit was the type you hook over stuff . Cheap and somewhat effective for a belt , but sometimes when you have night calls you are not wearing a belt , heck you may not be wearing pants . Having a clip that can be opened and closed like the CT-10 makes it possible to clip to a bathrobe or other garb more easily . A passive clip needs a more rigid material to hook to . MINOR ISSUES : This unit has a red light on the end of the microphone . It only tells you if the unit is on a dial tone or in use ( blinking ) . It would be nice if it indicated mute as well . Since it is barely in your line of sight , I did not notice it initially . It is more of an indicator to others that you are on a call . On both the CT-10 and this unit the CT-12 , the base unit could not be near any other electronics otherwise you would get a strong buzz . Easy enough to fix . I was quite pleased how far I could wander around the house though . Often I was outside gardening while chatting on the phone . Unfortunately , this is how the CT-10 got broken ..  
1	  This thing sucks .. the only reason i gave it two stars is because i finally got it to work on aim and can talk to my gf . The software is horrible ! Buy something else unless your really poor .  
2	  I am totally impressed with this camera , it is a professional model and I use it for wildlife pictures . Great images and easy to use .  
2	  I have been using the headset that came with my Panasonic cordless phone for many years now ( at least five , perhaps more ! ) I have tried other headsets , but they all were either uncomfortable or sounded bad . The vinyl over the ear cushion was peeling , but it still worked - until the headband finally snapped . It didn't owe me anything . I was delighted to see that the exact same headaset , as best as I can tell , is still sold as the KX-TCA60 . I bought two and the comfort and sound quality is excellent . I agree with the other reviewers who ask " why pay more ? " .  
2	  I really enjoy this product . Very well made and display is very clear . Easy to use and great value for the money . The thing I like the most is the sound quality . It is just great ! The WOW option to enhance the sound is very good and the subwoofer control as well . The only thing I miss is an USB entry in the front panel , but for the rest it is perfect .  
2	  These are good headphones . The earcups are large , but that helps give you better sound quality . The signal from the base to the headphones is a FM radio signal , and sometimes you have to adjust it . Overall , these are really good headphones .  
2	  If you need a universal remote and you want one to also control your XBOX 360 , do not hesitate , this is the one . I had searched for a while for the perfect universal remote and finally decided on this one and I truly reccomend it . The user manual , which is basically non existent is not that great , but once you set it up and spend some time with it , it 's great . Give yourself an hour or two to fine tune the remote , and you 'll ask how you have gone so long without it . I have a Comcast DVR , RCA Audio Reciever , Samsung HDTV , a Pelican AV Selector , and the XBOX 360 and this remote controls all of them . You also create a " profile " for each activity using the different sources . If I watch TV , I 'm using the TV , the Reciever and the DVR and the profile I create controls all three , plus I can make any buttons do whatever I want . Because the default choice for OnDemand was far up on the remote I made one of the unused XBOX buttons ( yellow ) my OnDemand button . The remote is actually better than I thought it was going to be , serioulsy . I searched for ages and I 'm glad I made this choice . The only reason I 'm writing this review is because the remote worked beyond what I thought it would do and I figure there has to be more people like me trying to figure out which one is best . One hint I 'll share is that if you click on " devices " it will cycle through your sources and profiles , something I found by accident that made the remote even easier to use . I thought I had to use the LCD select areas to get back to my " watch tv " setting , but by hitting " devices " it will cycle back to you profile . Anyways , easily 5 stars !  
2	  The lens is a great accessory for my Canon G9 . Also , I ordered the conversion lens adapter , but amazon did not have it on stock . They took almost twenty days to send my order ! Except for the problem of slow delivery , I 'm happy with my purchase .  
2	  This is another aid to help get a great picture , I 'm starting to shake a lot in my elder years and it sure helps to have this item .  
2	  This wireless adapter is a wonderful little device . All you have to do is plug it into a USB port , pop the cd into the drive and away you go .. wireless and connected ! I was pleasently surprised because I was not using a router of the same brand and everything worked anyway . Linksys WUSB54G Wireless-G USB Adapter  
1	  I bought this camera 1 week ago , I am still trying to figure out how to use it . The viewing menu is so small I can hardly read it , even with glasses on . I had three people trying to help me figure it out and couldn't do it . I am in the process of trying to understand the manual , that is very hard to do , it is no easy to read . I bought this camera because it was supposed to be a simple point and shoot , not so , there are more instructions to read and understand than anything I have ever bought . I tried to return it but couldn't because I opened the package , how else would I know its complicated and impossible to use ? so I am stuck with this thing and I have not been able to take one picture . If you want a simple camera , forget this one . Stick to a company that just makes cameras .  
1	  I recently bought this item . It was easy to set up and worked great at first , but that didn't last long . Soon , I began experiencing little problems like when I would open the disc tray it would open then close as soon as it opened . Nothing too bad . The sound was great . However , less than a month after I got it , I was watching a DVD . A strange smell started coming from the player like something was burning . Suddenly it froze up . I couldn't get it to do anything . I couldn't even get the disc tray to open . I tried turning it on and off and unplugging it , but nothing worked . I finally had to remove the cover just to force it open to get my DVD back . Botton line : DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !  
1	  My daughter received this camera as a gift . Koday Easyshare was supposed to be so great , but I don't agree . I am not a novice at taking pictures and have taken many great pictures with my Canon Powershot . The Kodak camera eats up batteries like mad . There is a delay between pressing the button and when the camera actually snaps the picture , which has resulted in many missed shots . It is very sensitive to motion and pictures come out blurry . On top of that the software that you use to download pictures ( and you need the software to download , unlike the Canon ) is a memory hog and bogs down my computer ( 2 different versions installed on two computers ) . Other than the camera being lightweight , I don't have anything good to say about it . I realize this is an older model now ( not when we received it ) , but it 's only two years old and I 'm ready to pitch it because it is so frustrating to use .  
1	  I bought two of these ink cartridges . The first one left smudges on every paper so I threw it away . The second one was practically EMPTY . Are you serious ? After the 5th page , the cartridge ran out of ink . It would only print a few lines of distorted text and quit . FMLI do not recommend these re-manufactured ink cartridges . Its a complete waste of money . I knew I should have spent the extra money on HP 's OEM ink . / End Rage  
2	  The moon is very bright when viewing thru my C8-SGT scope . I find this filter an absolute requirement for prolong studing of the moon and looking at details . I use this filter on both my stratus , Meade 5000 , and Expl . Sc . EP . Works great !  
2	  We Searched for the best TV and this is what we came up with . This TV hooked up to a HI Def . signal is one of the best pictures you can get . When we hooked up the dvd player I was blown away , the picture was like glass then we had the HI Def Sat . hooked up and that was even better . I sit only 7 to 9 feet away from tv and there is no blur at all , and the best thing about DLP is to bring the tv back to new all you have to do is change a lightbulb about every 4 or 5 years . ( No tech . has to come to your house to realine your tubes or color like in plasma or LCD . Also there is no way to burn image in to this screen unlike plasma or LCD . ( for the kids who like to play video games . ) Stay at 50 to 55 inch screen anything larger will tend to strech the picture then you get the blur ! All in all the hookups are great and i can lift this tv myself .  
1	  This is a nice unit except it needs a shroud to keep some glare away from the screen so that you can see while using it outside .  
2	  Simple review ; I LOVE IT ! Believe me , I looked all over the internet , looked at all those Youtube reviews etc etc . This is what I found and what I purchased . It ' s the best ! . Buy it , no hassle , easy to use , comes in a handy bag with all the goodies . The steady view ( IS ) is AMAZING ! It ' s like a digital camera that you focus .  
1	  I purchased the Sentry HO2.1 headphones a week ago . Beside the fact that it requires batteries to work , they seem like a great deal . The problem : The set that I have are picking-up radio interference . As soon as I turn it on and plug into a device I can hear the same radio station clear as a bell . The strange thing is I don't even have to plug it into a device ; I can just touch the metal contact of the cord to most large metal objects in the house and listen to this one radio station ! I think its some manufacturing defect causing these headphones to behave as a simple bandpass filter and since it has its own power source it just amplifies the interference . Regardless of the cause , it is an extremely annoying problem since no mater what I 'm listening to there is always faint gospel music playing in the background ! Folks I kid you not . I am willing to accept that this is a defect only in the pair that I have , though I would not bet on it .  
2	  Recieved the product within a few days in excellent condition . It was by far the lowest price that I could find anywhere . The product works great , the service was great , what else could you ask for ? I just may give up shopping in retail stores .  
2	  This is an awesome alarm clock . The dual settings are great and work well for when you and your spouse have different schedules .  
1	  .. unless you want to type on a keyboard with the key designations worn away . Over time , all of the used keys wear so that the letters cannot be read . Also it looks crummy when the keys wear . You cannot get replacement keys from the manufacturer either . I tried . Not only were replacement keys not available , the girl " helping " me was a snippy little b-h . The keys are backlit and the lighting is uneven from the start . The keyboard is okay , if you don't mind the keys looking bad after use .  
1	  I 've used HP products for years and have never seen such a poorly made printer from them . It is made of very cheap plastic including the hinges . You better be a delicate person to use this . So , I unpackaged the printer , installed the toner and setup up the printer in no time . I tried to add paper but had to move the plastic pieces to acomodate letter size and it wouldn't move . By the time it did ( brute force ) it felt like it broke but seemed ok . Next I ran a test rpint and had ghosting and black all over the pages , even after 30 pages . I ran the clean utility built in and that made it worse . So , I decide to pull the toner and look at it and a spring flies off into the guts of the printer . NICE ! The toner is now shot and won't go back in and there is no way I will purchase another and waste the money . What a waste , do not buy !  
1	  I was hoping to have a good quality , very portable digital camera to capture the precious moments of my babies ' early years . After 3 months it was dropped and I sent it in for repair ( covered under warranty ) and it was returned good as new . We 've used it a lot . Now I charge the battery , insert it into the camera , and the camera turns on for a second , then turns back off . Unresponsive . Dead . Tried new battery . Nothing . Repair costs more than what I paid . It was a great camera .. I was just hoping it would last more than 2 years .  
2	  After reading all the reviews for these speakers , I thought it sounded a little too good to be true . Nope . These are awesome , I 'm really happy to have such good sound quality out on my deck .  
2	  I ordered my TV over the holidays . Delivery was perfect using Eagle and the set had no problems . Picture on both HD and 480i is beautiful . Using with a Sony upconvert DVD player with it which again provides a beautiful picture . Monitor converts flawlessly between video modes . Wide button on remote very handy for dealing with programs running on HD channels which are not in widescreen formatAlso have this hooked up to my laptop running at 1920 x 1080 resolution . Again , picture looks awesom . Don't regret order at all .  
1	  Looks nice , light , incredibly small , great features , unfortunately mine only lasted 6 days . Completely stopped working , fortunately J & R took it back with no hassle .  
2	  I actually purchased this product to use with a 13 inch TV / VCR combo and it works just fine on top of a small trunk  
2	  If you 're looking for a filter that successfully filters UV light to get those wonderfully contrasted images you might be imagining , you 're better off getting something else . The product description here and on Tiffen 's website can be a bit misleading for someone who doesn't read it carefully , but essentially this filter is just another piece of glass made for protecting the main lens . After a few test images taken against a desk lamp I did find that the filter did produce more glare at * certain * angles BUT for regular shooting in a moderately well lit area it did just as fine as the lens by itself . Ultimately , I did buy this for protection purposes , as I would much rather have this ten dollar-ish filter break than spend $ 400 + to replace my lens if it ever gets scratched . For THIS purpose , this filter is sturdy and sufficient . Nothing special , nothing much to complain about . 4 stars .  
1	  I have 2 digital cameras , a new Kodak Z612 and a Casio EXILIM about a year old . Neither camera recognizes this card . I tried formatting it and the cameras still do not recognize the card . The 3D website does not even show the card . Tiger Direct will not accept it as a return . 2 lessons : don't buy this card and don't buy anything Amazon sells of Tiger Direct .  
1	  The first couple days it seemed to work fairly well , even though it had a bit of static in the background . After that the static became louder than the audio on the TV , so I returned it . I would have given it a rating of 1 star , but thought perhaps I just received a defective one . However , I didn't bother to order another , because after seeing it I felt it wasn't worth the price . Hence the 2-star rating .  
2	  I bought this to watch TV , so I don't have the auto-off problem . The overall built quality is decent except the really annoying background noise . To minimize the impact of it , you may have to change your position to find a right angle . Because it has no " cups " to cover your ears like many other headphones do , it is easy to fall and hurt your ears .  
1	  purchased from walmart terrible reception . Ordered from mach speed technologies fm transmitter with remote that works great no static like the roadmaster unit . and it was cheaper with remote to boot .  
1	  I can understand 5-10 days for shipping . I don't get 5-7 days to even pick it off a shelf and get it to UPS . Same day I bought something from Newegg , same 5-10 day shipping and I had it two days later . Forget Amazon !  
2	  Works as advertised . It is a good accessory for the Canon EF 50mm f / 1.8 II Standard AutoFocus Lens . Worth the few extra dollars .  
1	  There was no problem in its installation , and I was enjoying the net surfing for 4 months . Suddenly it drops the connection to DSL modem ( SBC pac-bell is a provider ) , and I have to give it a cool down . It works next two days , but it drops again .. , Their support line is always busy . I will buy another router from Netgear .  
2	  Update : just tried the Antec with my hot-running PS3 , and it helps it run cooler ! So now I own 2 of them .. + I took a long time investigating laptop cooler options , and the Antec works perfectly with my Dell Inspiron E1705 . Most coolers are made cheaply and don't fit a 17 " widescreen laptop very well . This one is well-constructed , runs quietly ( in low-speed mode ) and looks great under the laptop , on top of my desk . I imagine what others have stated is true : this unit works best with rear-facing internal laptop fan systems like the Inspiron 's . I know my system is running cooler because it was over-heating while running certain CPU-intensive software before , and now it isn't .  
2	  I own this from last one year . I did research from Infinity Beta series , Atlantic Technology , KEF , M & K ; .. many others . They sound great but they are bulky . If you want similar performance and nice look ( Virtually invisible ) yes , Bose is the way to go . I hooked up this to my Yamaha RXV 1500 THX Receiver . It shakes . This is definitely NOT Radio-shack quality .  
1	  Unfortunately I only read good reviews back when I bought my DVD player . For all those considering the purchase today , don't do it ! I guess I 'm one of the lucky ones . My unit lasted for 18 months before dying . Panasonic should be shot for their lack of attention to this issue . I 'll never buy another product from them .  
1	  OK so the product is not bad , but when you purchase it under the pretense of receiving a $ 25.00 rebate , then have to fight both VisionTek and Amazon . com it makes it a negative experience . I bought this when I was in Iraq serving during Operation Iraqi Freedom and had it shipped by a relative to me . When I got home I wanted the rebate .. and the trouble began . The still-not-gotten rebate is NOT worth the trouble . I would have purchased another larger capacity item if not for the low price after rebate .  
1	  After spending about an hour configuring this remote , to replace two of my other remotes , I was not able to set up ANY of its functionality to make me want to pick it up . The simple activities I tried didnt work at all ( the help button failed to learn anything ) , so I set up the controls by device . After getting all the buttons nicely mapped , I realized I 'd rather just pick up my other dedicated remotes ( which already have perfect button mappings ! ) than to press a minimum of 3 buttons to switch device and do something using the Harmony 550 .  
1	  This is the first portable cd player I was actually willing to spend some money on since I 've started college . The first day I listened to it , I already had problems with the lock mechanism staying locked . Also , I thought I had a faulty headphone jack because it kept shorting out , but my friend also bought one too and her headphone jack was not in very good working condition too . I was willing to overlook the problems , and a few days later , I was very upset at the fact that the cd player would not play anything . It would not get off the hold mechanism . I thought maybe it was the batteries and it wasn't . Now , I haven't been able to play anything on it for a week and I 'm going to send it back . Every time I press any button , " hold " flashes on the screen even though it is not on hold . I never dropped it and always took good care of it-it just must be of very poor quality . I definitely recommend NOT buying this item . Aiwa is not a good brand and I know I 'll never purchase anything under that brand name again .  
2	  I did a lot of research on notebooks before finally deciding to buy this one when Amazon reduced the price due to the rebate . I 'm glad I spent the extra money and went with the Sony Vaio with the carbon casing . My priorities were a lightweight notebook with good speed , and this fits the bill and more . I use this notebook to some extent as a desktop replacement but I have also travelled with it on long haul flights to Australia and Asia . I have absolutely no complaints : it 's very light , extremely fast and the screen is gorgeous . Having previously used an IBM Thinkpad , and hearing iffy things about the Sony keyboard , I was a little concerned but there were no problems adjusting . I have downloaded several movies on it , and it performs extremely well . I have also run it down to the end of its battery life , and have not had any problems with it becoming too hot or suffering any electric shocks as some other people may have mentioned . The only ( minor ) issue I have is that it doesn't take compact flash cards .  
2	  Delivery was prompt , packaging was perfect .. set up took probably 3-5 minutes and dialing in the RF was less than that . If you plugged in speaker before , you can have these working in not time . Sound clarity is very good with the TV , movies and video games . Highly recommend this product for the price .  
2	  Needed to replace a cable and this one works just the same as any other RCA cable , except it feels ( tactile wise ) smooth / soft , it doesn't have the usual hard / rough plastic sheathing that most RCA cables do , it bends very nicely so it 's easily hidden or run through tighter areas . As far as quality , it seems just as good as any other wires that I 've used ( and I have rat nests all over my house unfortunately ) . Good price for 12 ' audio cord .  
2	  I bought this at Sears after comparing it to all of the others on display . This was our first LCD , after owning CRT and projection TVs . The Samsung easily outperformed the other available brands in the store . Viewed next to the higher-contrast model , the difference is obvious , but at home it is by itself and the contrast on this model is adequate . The best feature is the sound ; this is the only equipment I own where I can listen to CDs ( through a DVD player ) without an audible background hiss . Be mindful that if it is mounted on an inside wall , the sound will be clearly audible in the adjoining room .  
1	  I bought these to replace the standard iPod and Sony ear buds . I was under the impression that I would get a much deeper bass response . I was wrong . The bass reproduction is simply horrid . I read somewhere there is a " break-in " period . I have found this not to be true . They sound just as bad after 50 hours of listening as they did brand new . This is my first pair of Sennheiser and am very disappointed . I know they are low-end headphones - but I expected more . My recommendation is to keep researching .  
1	  For all the good things that have been said and written about these headphones , if you can't tolerate how they FEEL on your ears , the sound quality is worthless . Try them on for several hours-then decide . I planned to use these to replace BOSE 1 's ( stolen from luggage cart ) and 2's-left behind on the plane , and swiftly gone . After trying them on a trans-con flight last week , I actually had to remove the ATs and switch to the airline 's cheepos to survive to the end of the movie . I wrote to Audio-Technica about the problem-mainly the stitching and rough inner fabric that irritate the ears , at least MY ears . They replied promptly and constructively , but had no fix for the problem and suggested I return them to the retailer . ( Unfortunately for me , the retailer 's 14-day return period is over . )  
2	  The Epson 1520 has been a great printer for my business . I am a graphic designer and have to print out color proofs at large sizes to enclude crop marks and bleeds . My color is always right on . I also use the Epson RIP for printing out EPS files , it works fantastic-no problems .  
1	  Ok this product seemed easy to setup and worked fine for about 2 days untill i noticed problems with it . Rocket Area 3 won't work , no more than 3 out of the 4 people on my network could use AIM , FTP eventually died . If you have verizon DSL or any other provider supplying VPN / DSL using PPOE serivce not a good choice of router . Its now to the point that the router won't even ping out when i know the DSL connection is running . I only had 4 machines running off it ( with a hub ) all configured properly . Also , the password protection i didn't like . Too short of letters to use . The firewall on this is the biggest joke i 've ever seen . The same game saw 2 different list of servers ( neither computer had even the same server not even 1 ) that eventually had a ping of 99999 ? . Good grief .. and when i tried to contact d-link hmm d who ? tech support wasn't very helpful . My DSL provider ( verizon which is a joke in its self ) couldn't help me either ( which is no surprise to me ) . Anyway not good product period .  
2	  There are several other brands that manufacture identical type color ink tanks but you should not use them . In comparison with the Canon ink tank they are conspicuously less accurate in color and lower in quality . They easily jam up the printer , costing more to repair the printer than the initial savings they provide . While it may be safe to go with different brands for black ink , stay with this high-quality Canon ink tank for color .  
2	  i bought it for my friend to use because she wanted an 8G . It has Enough space to store thousands of pics .  
2	  I 've purchased ink for the Epson 1270 and found you can't beat original ink cartridges . Amazon has the best prices and free delivery . Refills have never worked very well for me .  
1	  I got their product because of a rebate and what I thought was a good product and company . When I got the items , it work fine but then I started to have problems and had to unplug it to get it to work . One day it just stoped working and I called customer service and they could not figure out what was wrong after hours on the phone with them . Then I came to find out that they made up some error with the rebate form and I would not be getting my rebate . Their customer service sucks and I will never buy their products again .  
1	  I purchased this CD changer from Amazon as Christmas present for my father . Unfortunately , my father later reported that it didn't work properly . On my next visit , I was able to confirm that the unit doesn't recognize most CDs , all of which play correctly in my car deck or in my home changer . A few CDs will work , but for most you can fill the entire carousel and the display continues to read , " No Disc " . Also unfortunate is the fact that my father lives a few hundred miles away , which is going to make it difficult for me to get the unit serviced at a Yamaha factory service center . The closest service center is 70 miles away from my father 's home . I like Yamaha as a company , and I own many , many Yamaha musical instruments and electronic components . I also realize that the changer I bought is not representative of Yamaha quality ; clearly this one has a defect . At the same time , when a defective unit is allowed to leave Yamaha 's factory , they deserve to get " dinged " for it . Also , as advice to those making purchases on Amazon , it is important that purchases be inspected within 30 days of receipt , as Amazon will only accept returns for that short period . This is true for all purchases , including defective items .  
2	  I purchased this three pack to test out a vintage Polaroid I found at a thrift store . The battery pack is built into the film and it works just fine . I wish that film for these cameras was not so expensive ; however , I understand why it is . I was not disappointed with this item .  
1	  [ .. ] Love Skype and have a few accessories for it , so figured it was worth a shot . Returned it . The drivers need updating and you should get the ones from the internet , that is clear from other reviews and a quick internet search . I did that . It worked . BUT - one computer kept " forgetting " that it had been installed and had to be reinstalled over and over . Then it didn't interface with Skype very well . And then it forgot it had been installed - so I reinstalled . Did this several times for about 2 hours . It would place call , then crash . Sound didn't work - dropped parts of conversations . Switched to a newer computer . Installed updated drivers . All going great . Made call from phone-BUT , once the call started to be placed , sound switched back over to the computer - sound coming out through computer speakers , and corded phone made great paperweight attached to my computer via a usb hub . All in all , wasted 3.5 hours on this product , plus a trip to the post office .  
2	  I know , I know .. you 're looking at this Olympus flash and thinking " Oh _ ( substitute your particular phrase here ) .. I can't afford that , why would Olympus do me like that .. I just shelled out good money on my E-500 or E-330 and I don't want to pay that much for a freakin ' flash unit " . We 've all been there . So you start looking at the FL-36 ( I own one too and like it ) and you start rationalizing that well , maybe you don't need the biggest / " bestest " flash on the planet .. Maybe you 've even taken a glance at the FL-20 ( got that one as well , not bad for portability ) .. well , just stop already . Start saving your change from the store and save and BUY THIS ONE .. why ? Because it is everything a flash unit should be . Big . Bright ( guide # is 164 feet people ! ) . Full control . and best of all , it recycles fast , fast , fast . I just couldn't believe how quickly I could hit that shutter button a 2nd , 3rd , 4th , & 5th time ( careful not to go too far .. all flash units can be damaged if you overtax them ) . It was awesome .. practically no waiting as I do with my FL-36 ( my only real complaint about that unit , otherwise it is excellent ) . Lastly , I suggest you purchase an Omni Bounce cap to fit over ( Sto-Fen makes a large line of them ) . Once you have , you will have rendered the darkness impotent against you and your mighty Olympus FL-50 .. after all , you and I are after the same thing , right ? GREAT PICTURES . The FL-50 helps get you there . No doubt it is one expensive flash unit .. but worth it in the end .  
1	  I contacted the seller but have not heard back yet . The ipod was supposed to be shipped a month ago but I still haven't received it . I 'm not sure what to do . Please help . Thanks , Greg  
1	  The review announces this item to be able to read US DVD as well as European . It 's wrong . The first thing you discover on the box is : " This DVD only plays DVDs from the US " !  
1	  Bought this >1 yr ago for ~ $ 350 . For B & W copies or B & W prining in general , it uses a bit of color ink each time . You cannot turn it off . Phoned Customer Service , they said it does this to improve quality . I said this is unacceptable , fraud . Was transferred and then cut-off . I later looked this up and saw some printers do this - Epson 's do . This is a joke , especially considering in general this thing is an ink hog , and the ink is expensive . As well , the paper seems to jam often , and then the thing makes a super-loud grinding noise . The actual color photos are quite good . Next time I will stick to a cheap HP ( as I always had ) . Epson , never again . Should have known better to spend this much on a printer .  
1	  If you plan to use this camera in a medium to low light situation , please consider one of the cameras that has a ISO rating of 400 or 800 . Not having an optical zoom feature like other cameras , it is very difficult to zoom in on your subjects unless you walk up to them and stand just a couple of feet from them . In addition , under low light situations , the LED viewer is not able to show the images you are trying to take photos of . You are restricted to using the view finder to find what you are trying to take a photo of . I found out about this limited feature while attending a wedding reception . I was not able to see what I was trying to take a photo of unless I used the view finder and as a result , many of my photos show the bride and groom very far off in the actual photo . The camera takes wonderful photos outdoors and in limited flash photo situations so it is a great camera for those types of photos . As for indoor , low light photos , it may turn out to be a nightmare . Happy photo shooting .  
2	  I just bought this camera a few weeks ago and from the begining took great pictures . Very easy to use and fiqure out . I am very happy with the quality and performance . Love the date factor . Love the camera ! Good job by Cannon !  
1	  I got this to replace my son 's other charger that the cats had chewed the cord into pieces . It started the device to charge and just quit . Never has worked again . I should have returned it . I won't buy this again !  
2	  I did a lot of looking around before I bought this printer . I needed the top feed for all the different kinds of printing I do and we were also needing a scanner . The printer is really fast and the scanner works perfectly and easily . I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase . It even fits nicely on my desktop .  
1	  Great sound , but the cord is too short , even if you use an MP3 player on an armband . If you turn your head while exercising , you will pull the left ear bud right out . The right one has a longer cord and will hold . They do give you an extension cord , but it is too long and the connection point is too heavy . The excess weight will also pull on the earbuds and the left one ( with the shortest slack ) will come out . On a five-mile ride / run I had to readjust this set several times . If not for the amazing sound , I would have given this product just one star . It would be a good set of headphones if you listen to music while lounging indoors .  
1	  This is a comment about Maxtor that applies to all models of external hard drives . About 5 years ago , I bought a Maxtor FireWire 80GB drive when it was a new and expensive item . I then bought a PC laptop that it did not work with . Customer " support " told me that it will not work with some computers . Period . Now I discovered that I lost the ( non-standard ) power cord while moving . I figured that the company would charge an outrageous price for a replacement , but was shocked when they told me that they do not have a replacement . Furthermore , they were not able to provide me with a technical description of the cord so that I could try to buy it elsewhere . They were able to tell me that no current models use the same cord , however . I bought this drive for long-term storage / backup . I paid a lot for it , and now I 'm left checking eBay every week so that I can buy an entire used drive-just for the power cord . I will not buy another Maxtor product .  
2	  First , I have to say Amazon isnt lying when they say the price on this TV is a ' great deal ' considering I just bought this exact TV from [ store ] for about 400-500 dollars more . I went through all the Plasmas and LCD 's in [ store ] before deciding on this one . This TV was one of the best looking and one of the more unique ones in the store . The TV has a circular base which lets you move it as far right or left as you 'd like so no matter where you sit you can tilt it - But its so huge you probably wont need to .. You should definitely have this delivered considering the huge size and weight . Its 40 inches and its a widescreen . The TV is fairly easy to set up considering all the different features . It took me less than 10 minutes . You can connect a PC , a camcorder , and the standard things like DVD . It has everything . You can change screen sizes , freeze moving pictures , Daylight savings time , etc .. If youre looking for a very large TV with a good picture and reasonably priced then buy it . Try to buy it from Amazon and not the store because you get a better deal here . Overall , good value for the money and Highly Recommended .  
1	  Want a frustrating part time job with no pay ? Buy a Zune . I bought mine back in October . Plays music just fine . The nightmare is managing the music files and updates . I use a trusted software program - Media Monkey - to manage all my music files on my PC . When I did the initial setup the Zune grabbed all of the music files from Media Monkey . When I went into my Zune Library , most of the CD 's were broken into 2 pieces , with some songs in one file and some in another . So I spent a lot of time in my Zune library trying to put the files back together . Some changes were accepted , some would not stick . I spent a lot of time making changes , syncing to my Zune device , and then finding new problems in the library . Then I tried to update to a new version and the updates fail with no real explanation other than to " close all programs and try again " . When I went to the support site I read way to many horror stories about the update , so I guess I 'm lucky it failed . And don't even think you 're going to get real support for this thing . Microsoft 's idea of support is user self service . They want us to read through pages and pages of user suggestions to find our fix . So I 'm not going to update , I 'll work with what I have . And when my Zune dies I 'll buy an iPod . And then I 'll replace my PC with a Mac . Then I will be free from the crappy software from Microsoft .  
2	  I appreciate the promptness with which I received my Palm in just a few days with a nice note from the vendor giving his phone number and to call if I had any questions or problems . I would recommend purchasing from the vendor .  
2	  This laser toner cartridge works great , no problems at all . Quality product at a price within my budget !  
1	  I 'm a long-time Palm user ( love ' em ) , and liked the looks and feel of the Visor Edge . Unfortunately , recharging the battery has been a problem , and [ money ] is too much to pay for a disposable handheld that works for two weeks . I had to perform a hard reset to get it to charge the day I brought it home , and when I set it up for Mom as a gift nothing , I mean nothing , would get it to charge . Soft reset , hard reset , even an in-the-cradle reset , nothing works . .. Quality control just seems to be real problem for Handspring . I won't be buying another one . Getting Mom a Smartphone !  
2	  I 'm so happy with my new lamp . & # 60 ; br / & # 62 ; Looks just as cute as the picture and was quite easy to put together ( provided you 're used to ' do it yourself ' itemsThe quality is wonderful and was frankly nicer than I was expecting . & # 60 ; br / & # 62 ; Bravo lamp !  
1	  I really cannot recommend this product . When it works it is wonderful . Unfortunately , that is about 70 % of the time . The rest of the time I cannot connect for some unknown issue . I suppose it is come combination of my router ( configured as Sling Media directed ) , my ISP , my home network , and the Internet in general . The bottom line is that the product is not reliable for a computer professional such as myself . The average person does not have a chance . Checkout the online forums at slingcommunity . com before you buy . It is filled with people tearing out there hair . Further , Sling Media has been promising version 2.0 of the player software and a BlackBerry version of the software since January . 5 months later and they are still vaporware .  
1	  Cons1 ) No shuffle2 ) No Playlists3 ) Resarts AT THE FIRST SONG each time you turn it onThe combination of these 3 shortcomings means you listen to all the songs alphabetically , from thebeginning each time you turn it on :( 4 ) Very slow file transfer ( why no USB 2.0 ? ) Pros1 ) Great sound2 ) Great controls3 ) Very small and light4 ) Very sharp lookingBottom Line : Would put up with it 's shortcomings if it were half the price .. she 's goin ' back !  
2	  Received adapter within 3 days of ordering . Setup was painless but I changed to Microsoft Network Connection instead of Linksys . Works great , no complaints .  
1	  I received this as a requested Christmas gift and was very much looking forward to having an easily portable drive that could play my CD collection at home as well as at work with docking stations , or , wherever I chose with the headphones . The unit I received was purchased new at Best Buy , along with a charging cable . Upon opening I found an 8 page simplisitc folder that tells you how to turn it on and off , but not much else . No problem - go to the iTunes website and download a 70 + page instruction manual . Great ! Here we go - loaded 700 Cd 's worth of music onto the iPod , and enjoyed it for three weeks . Then the iPod froze . I tried to re-sync but it would no longer recognize several files stored in the iTunes library . Deleted those files , " restored " the iPod to factory settings and tried to re-sync . If collecting different " unknown error messages " is your hobby you might be happy with this . Unless you 're a big fan of user forums that offer multiple solutions to problems that should 've been resolved before putting the product on the market I 'd suggest that you seriously consider other options before purchasing this product . ( And no , I 'm not an 80 yr old who knows nothing about them ' puters ' . )  
2	  Nothing wrong with the product . Comes with a lifetime warranty from Kingston , but I really doubt you 'll need to use it . Very good deal , but I would suggest buying 2gb micro SD cards instead of buying multiple 1gb ones ; you pay a bit more , but it 's a lot more convenient .  
1	  I loved this radio at first . It has a lot of bells and whistles and appears to be a quality radio . The earlier model lasted 20 years so when it finally gave out I purchased this model with the expectation that it would have a fair lifespan . It was treated with kid gloves sitting on my bedside stand in an airconditioned house and used for about one hour a day . After two years ( one year after the warranty ran out ) I tried to turn it on and found that keys were locked and 00:00 was flashing . I did everything the manual advised and then tried the Sony online chat . I was advised that it needed to be sent in for service . Then I tried email . They came to the same conclusion and added the link for service . No repair was available but they offered an exchange for a reconditioned radio at the cost of $ 120 plus tax and shipping . That is nearly the cost of a new radio ! I will never buy another SONY product . If you want an expensive disposable radio with neat features , this is the one for you .  
1	  These sound very flat . The bass is good , but everything else just sounds flat . Many other reviews have stressed this , but I figured maybe they were just being picky . They were not . If you want to listen to anything other than bass heavy music , don't buy these . Also mine didn't come with the airplane adapter , unless they no longer ship with it .  
1	  We have had our JVC VCR for 1.5 yrs . Three weeks ago , the power just completely blew out . Since we spent a little more for what we thought was a good VCR , we took it for repair . The repair man just called me to say that JVC has parts to repair our VCR on backorder for 2 months , and this is a sign to him that it has serious problems . He also said we spent about$280 for a $ 100 VCR . So needless to say , we are feeling a bit ripped off .  
1	  Buyer Beware . The N750 will not record off the Directv Tivo hard drive in color . Why ? Who knows . Certainly not Sony , who denies a problem exists , despite post after post from affected owners of the N750 and N700 on various websites ( eg , Tivo community ) that all complain of the identical issue . Even after I proved I could record in color using a borrowed 8yr old Zenith VCR and the identical cables / hook-up and tape , Sony refuses to acknowledge a compatability issue with Tivo . They did make me the generous offer of shipping me an identical , " refurbished " model for $ 45-$80 dollars ( depending on warranty status ) .. that also won't work . If you enjoy color , and you own a Directv Tivo , buy another brand ! If you want to spend quality time with Sony 's head in the sand , technical support gurus , then the N750 is the unit for you .  
2	  I have just started using this keyboard a few days ago so can't speak for durability . The extra hand rest is optional , and does need to be attached ( if space does not permit ) . This keyboard is not very quiet , just average on sound levels . There are 3 light options ( blue , red , purple ) and you can adjust the brightness of each , which is nice . Overall , it 's a good keyboard , serves the purpose , and works fine . I would buy it again if I had to .  
2	  I wanted to wait about 3 months before writing this review - I 'd feel horrible if I praised it after 2 months , only to have it go bad on the third . Anyway , unlike most happy owners who praise this as a great alternative to an iPod Nano , I 'm kicking myself for ever getting buying an iPod ( okay , it was a present for my wife ) seeing how much better a player this is . The Sansa isn't as slim as a Nano , but when you hit the size of a Zippo lighter , does every extra mm down really matter that much ? It 's really my first mp3 player , so much of my love stems from the novelty of being able to carry around gigabytes worth of music . I 'm no audiophile , but the sound quality was good , and the Sansa 's firmware allows you to sort through your music by song title , album , artist or genre . ( To get your song 's identifying info just right , you should download a good mp3 tagging program ; I 've been happily using " mp3tag " , which is available free for DL - it 's simple to use and configure , but that doesn't mean that there aren't better programs available on the internet ) . Transferring your music is simple - your Sansa will connect to the computer using a USB port . The Sansa uses two connection modes : MTP ( which treats the Sansa like a media player to be synced ) and UMS ( which treats the player as an extra HD - happily enough , this mode , which I find easier to use , also allows you to use that add-on tagging software , so you get the best of both worlds ) . The buttons are bit on the thin side , and you have to be careful when using the forward or reverse buttons to scan through songs lest you also skip to the next / earlier track . You can easily scan within mp3 tracks or add songs to your " go list " . The surprise here is the video player . Though the screen is small , and pixelations are a fact of life on playback , the resulting images are easily watchable . ( Although it 's probably optimal for character dramas and sitcoms that lack any demanding visuals ; the included movie , a 30-second spot likely inspired by one of the latter " Star Wars " movies , was an unfortunate choice for spotlighting the Sansa 's video capabilities . ) Framerate is about 15fps - it 's noticeable , but it 's hardly a slideshow . Video files have to be converted before they 'll play on the Sansa which .. is no problem at all . The accompanying software is simple and is finicky only against files with really long names . Just find the files you want , click " convert " and the program takes care of the rest . My commutes are now survivable thanks to the Sansa and hours of unwatched TV . Playback can be a problem though - if you fastforward too much , the video breaks down . Luckily , the software automatically breaks every video file down into half-hour sized chunks . Left alone , the video played well - with only infrequent skips , and few jumps between video and audio syncing . The Sansa charges off your PC 's USB port . For those not connected 24-7 , a Macally charger can be had for about [ .. ] . However , the Sansa has good endurance - I packed one on vacation and managed to not need a charger despite watching several hours of video and listening to a fair number of mp3s . The Sansa isn't just a great alternative to the iPod , it 's a great player all around .  
1	  I notice that none of the people who praise this product mention what theirs looks like exactly . The thing I got is not labeled " Merkury " and is a different shape than the one in the main photo on this page . Mine has labels " power " , " usb2.0 " , and " Targus " . I don't know whether Amazon or the seller got the picture wrong , or maybe this whole page is mislabeled and it 's really about a completely different product ( Mercury Innovations ? ) , or maybe Targus has changed what they sell under this SKU number ( but then , why re-use a cursed SKU number ? ) . However , the device I got matches the photo that 's on Targus 's own page for the TGR-CRD25 . Anyway I am just barely able to use my Targus-labled thing with two old ( circa 2001-2003 ) Macs . These Macs have USB 1.0 ports . I 've never got the Targus to work plugged directly into a USB 1.0 port , but by plugging it into a USB 2.0 hub connected to the Mac , I have some luck . I use it to connect a 4 GB SD card . It almost never works just by plugging it in and plugging the card into it . Here is the procedure that has eventually worked for me every time so far : Plug the cable into a USB 2.0 hub or USB 2.0 port on your computer . Unplug the other end of the cable from the Targus . Plug the memory card into the Targus . Now , plug the cable into the Targus and wait a second . If the blue power light goes on solid , it 's failed , unplug , wait a couple seconds and repeat . If the blue light blinks a few times , you 're in business . No way am I guaranteeing this will work for you . But , if you 're desperate or too lazy to return the thing ( like me ) it might be worth a try . Well , maybe five or ten tries .  
1	  This item was terrible the songs would sound very choppy , when you played the video the words would come way after the lips ended moving . I suggest you get something name brand for maybe 20 or thirty dollars more . Maybe a Samsung mp3 video player i bought one shortly after way way better .  
2	  I purchased this 4/3 lens for use on a Leica Digilux . I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this lens . It is a very good performer , and for the price cannot be beat .  
2	  Why in the world would a person pay $ 30-$150 for an HDMI cable at any retail store ? The more cutting question is how those retailers can sleep at night charging those kind of prices . Its digital , not analog . It either works or it doesn't . These cables work . Seem sturdy . Enough said .  
1	  I got this for my daughter for Christmas . She opened the box . She loved it . Then she tried to get it to work . Then she asked me to try to get it to work . Then we called iRiver telephone support . Then we got an RMA and returned it for a new one . When we got the new one in the mail we opened the box . We were glad it came . Then we tried to get it to work . We found that we needed to phone iRiver telephone support . We did as they suggested . Then we had to phone iRiver telephone support again . We are very sad . If you want to listen to music on a portable device you may want to get something other than iRiver . On the other hand , the iRiver telephone support people were very understanding .  
2	  The device was very easy to set up and works great . I went to Office Depot and they tried to sell me a whole set up for about $ 100 , telling me there really wasn't any other way to go , which didn't sound right . So I looked online and found this simple little device . Very inexpensive , and it took only a few minutes from opening the package to printing from both computers like I wanted to . I also installed the cd to use the auto-sensing feature so I never have to mess with it . Great device at a great price .  
2	  Bought this for my new flash camcorder . Had it for 2 months , took it to the Bahamas and back .. worked flawlessly . Great value , would recommend to others .  
1	  Review what ? I didn't get the step-up ring I ordered ! The package was lost , and Adorama didn't answer my question , why I couldn't receive the step-up ring I bought ? Luckily , I wrote to Amazon after couple days waiting , and got the answer . Now I am waiting for the refund .  
2	  This item is a great little unit for the cost . YES-there is an issue with only burning 4X DVD-R media , but there is a downloadable firmware upgrade for this product that allows you to burn 8x DVD-R media . ( .. ) The firmware comes as a ZIP folder that you can download and burn onto either a 4X DVD-R or a CD-R . Just follow the instructions included with the ZIP folder . As for the 4X DVD-R problem . There are few walk-in stores that still have 4X media . You can shop on-line and have great success finding the media . HOWEVER , if you do the firmware upgrade , you won't need 4X DVD-R media . I have owned one of these players for over a year and I struggled with the problem of fining 4X media to burn . However , once I did the upgrade , I have had no trouble finding 8X media . I have transferred VHS tapes to DVD . I have copied movies from a DVR connected to the machine with no problems . I have played both rented VCR and DVD media with no issues . TRUST ME ! Do the firmware upgrade and you are all set ! Yes - it is a pain , but this is really a great machine !  
1	  The case looked nice and distinguished . I was happy as I took it out of the box and mounted my m100 .. I closed the snap . Then I opened the snap , and it broke . Tore right out . * sigh * Return Authorization , please .  
1	  This bag 's strap broke after two weeks , and it 's now unusable . Wasn't putting anything but the laptop in there , and it seems ridiculous that a laptop would be too heavy for a laptop bag ! Don't waste your money on this horrible bag !  
2	  I purchased a 100 inch with 4:3 aspect ratio for presenting a professional course in a rented hotel room that had an 8 foot ceiling . The screen was manageble ( despite its length ) . The setup was easy ( leveraging off of grade school familiarity with projector screens ) . The aspect ratio and size did a fine job in reflecting the output of a video projector with normal room lighting . I saved the purchase price easily rather than having the hotel 's audio / visual contractor provide the equipment . I am very pleased with the equipment and savings .  
1	  I had to give up my wonderful 10 yr old Sony for ERROR reasons . Rather than pay outrageous prices for a fix or refurbish , I shopped around for a new model . This received such good reviews that I bought it . I am disappointed . Sure it makes the house vibrate . But it sounds better one floor below me than it does in my own apartment . If you like pop , classical , etc , buy it . But if you 're like me and you enjoy heavier sounds , the equalizer plus X Bass cannot help you . For all of its supposed power .. it just creates a lot of vibration .  
1	  It works sometimes but most the time it can't pick up enough of a signal to work .  
1	  AVOID THISThe drivers for this product were simply not perfected to work with Windows XP . After several phone conferences and several hours , and e-mailing me a " special " set of drivers , still the help tech was unable to get me up and functioning - I sent it back . Aside - The tech was clearly motivated ( probably by his incentive system ) to try to get me " resolved " , and for several calls just didn't want to give up . But once hope was lost , his tone shifted instantly and he just wanted to close the discussion . I sent it back to the address it came from , but have NOT received a refund or any responde . I 'm chalking it up to a " lesson learned " .  
2	  I ordered the Dell keypad replacement , it took 5 days to arrive . It only took 2 minutes to replace . It is identical to the original only this one works ! Thanks for the good price and great product .  
1	  This item seemed to heat up fairly hot when I used it . I backed everything up to it , it comes with pretty good software . I hooked it up to a usb hub so I can control all these things at once . last night it began sticking and then started buzzing every five seconds . If you dont beleive me search on your google free agent buzzing . It seemed like it was incurable so I took it back . Seagate and Maxtor have always been run of the mill brands , I always trust western digital a bit more . DOnt know why . I got a mybook home . It is cool and easier to see when its working or not . Power button is clearly defined , unline the seagate . The seagat is also going to be top heavy on that wierd base it has . So You will have to place it in an area were it wont tip over . I lost interest and looked to western digital . The software they both use is the same one , so you wont have any issues going from one to another . Also Seagate had a bunch of uneeded software , the western digital had just what you needed , nothing more and nothing less . I liked that . The western digital world edition i passed up because people said it sounded like a rocket ship . The western digital home one doesnt sound like its on at all , its easy to see when the drive is working and I dig on that ! Good luck , if you get stuck with the seagate problem , I told ya so ! Jason  
1	  First , the quality of the image is horrible . It does support the S-Video , but the quality of output is even worse than the 8mm , not even close to Hi8 . I don't think my computer limits the performance . I am using P4 2.8G , with 512 MB ram . Second , the software provided has very limited function . It doesn't even has the split and combine function . Record audio track is impossible . With only a few effects to add on . Finally , the price is ok . DON'T EXPECT MUCH .  
1	  When I plugged this into my computer and turned it on , it caused my computer to reboot by itself every 12 minutes or so . I tried everything to find out what was causing that to happen and how to fix it to no avail . I still haven't figured out why it kept shutting down and restarting my Mac and now I 'm S.O.L. because I can't return it to Amazon without the styrofoam packing material that came inside the box ( which I threw out ) - a dumb rule . A complete waste of my money . If you have a Mac OS X , don't waste your time or money like I did !  
1	  Product worked great for 1 year and inexplicably the HD failed and no longer works . As an IT person , I 've tried everything ( swapping out cables , power and even tried connecting the device to my laptop and backup PC ) . It was good while it lasted . Now I 've lost 100GB of data . If you plan on buying , please remember to backup your LaCie HD .  
1	  Purchased this percolator after reading all the positive reviews . I 've been using Farberware for as long as I can remember , but in the last few years they don't last very long , and got tired of getting / returning them every 4-6 months . The Presto is even worse than the Farberware ! The coffee was weak and cold ! Do these companies realize that their products are not what they used to be ? They are charging the same prices but the products are substandard . Why do they continue to make them in China ? I will have to start using a stove top percolator again .  
1	  I provide desktop support for a medium sized company . Accounting bought several of these Cheap Pieces of XX . Make sure to follow the directions multiple times exactly as the instructions say . Because if you skip a step or plug in the printer at the wrong time HP printers run the risk of damaging the print spooler and possibly force you to reload your operating system . If you switch computers between cubicles and have 2 of these printers you have to move the printers also , because although they will both be the same model printers they wont work . If you are replacing one of these because you already had one installed that broke , the new one wont work . If the 1300 print driver was ever installed on the computer that you are trying to install this printer , It will not work until you point the ad remove printer wizard to the windows driver inf directory . then it will only run for a few days until it spits out nothing but garbage . I absolutely hate these printers and the most satisfying day at work was when I bashed one with an 8lb sledge hammer . I have the pictures to prove it . HP really dropped the ball on this piece of junk .  
2	  This is a neat product simple enough for a beginner to use , offering standard features that all pros would want to have . A good match for this camera is the Vivitar 2800 flash ( Amazon , please list this flash in the accessories section ) . Overall a great buy .  
2	  2 words .. SUPER COOL ! If you are looking for a MP3 / WMA / CDA CD player and don't want to spend a fortune , then this is the one ! By the way , I discovered that this thing also plays ASF files , and as some folks know that means you can encode with whatever codec you want including DivX . I don't know what others are talking about as far as skipping , I can't get mine to skip . I didn't bother to do the SP-100 upgrade hack as I don't see any reason to . This unit will play MP3 / WMA / ASF from discs with mixed files and directories . CD-RW is fully supported . Also , CD 's that are still " open " are supported , so if you are using a CD-RW and adding files to it everyday for instance , that won't be a problem .  
1	  This drum was not packaged very well . I 'm not sure if that was the issue , but I could not use the drum . Had to go out and buy another one !  
2	  Lately , ive had this obession with portable dvd players . I dont even need one , but they are just so COOL . Everytime i go to Best Buy , Circuit City , etc .. im always in the Car Section messing with the portable dvd players . Now , ive seen the best .. and ive seen the worst , so i can rate this dvd player with confidence . I was VERY skeptical about buying this DVD player , but what can i say .. im cheap , and dont wanna spend an arm and a leg getting something that will probably improve in 6 months anyways . Although .. I am extremely satisfied with this little dvd player . The quality of picture is about an 8/10 in my opinion . The battery only lasts for 3 hours and u have to charge it for 5 hours . Although i normally just plug it in an outlet anyways . You dont need batteries for the remote , which makes use much more convienent . The sound is excellent with or without headphones . 2 people can use their headphones at once , unlike many others that only have 1 slot for headphones . The design is OK . i dont like how the speakers are right under the screen , but i guess that doesnt really matter . Ive had this player for about 2 months now , and it hasnt skipped or froze even once . I actually enjoy watching movies on this little thing now more than on my computer on tv , just because i can move around . All i can say is that the price is great and is good for beginners b / c it resists alot of wear and tear ( very durable ) .  
2	  I use the headset with a Cisco 7960 - works great . I strongly recommend this product - excellent range and battery life . Too bad it 's not possible to pickup / hangup without connecting a headset lifter ( lame ) .  
1	  I am not pleased with this purchase . I needed a new battery for my cell phone . I did a search through Amazon and purchased the battery . This was a waste of money , as the battery will not hold a charge .  
1	  I bought this camera , and unfortunately , I had to return it . It came with SEVERAL booklets , and one would just refer you to another . It was just too difficult to figure out . I 'm a novice , and this was my first digital camera . I wanted something simple . I 'm sure it 's a very good camera for someone with digital camera experience , but this is NOT the camera for a first-time user .  
2	  I was very suspicious when i was shopping around for a new router . If you have had any router using experience ( i would hope you do ) then you know that there are some routers out there that have very very veryy bad user interfaces on them , with hidden controls etc . This was real easy to set up , with no actual ip configs etc ( the software does it all for you-THANK YOU ) . Then once its up and running , it takes about 1 min to setup security and passwords , awesome ! This is a good router , even if you don't have wireless-n . I don't , but my roommate does and his connection is rocket fast . We 're talkin 4-5 megs in a dorm room . Nice ! Get this router , especially for the price . You 'll be shooting yourself in the foot if you don't .  
2	  I bought these based on the reviews and have no regrets . Great Audio quality and as far as I can tell ( had them for a couple months now ) great build quality . I 've dropped these a number of times and unplugged / re-plugged them into my laptop many a time . They still are in perfect condition , also I remember some reviews complaining about the cord , I actually quite enjoy the coiled cord it allows for some stretching and it hasn't gotten tangled yet .  
2	  I purchased this actually somewhere else , but anyways this is a replacement for my 4 year old Dell . My original drive died probably from too much vibration . I love for the fact that is has " DuraStep Ramp ( tm ) " which parks the head during sudden movements , since I 'm always on the go . This drive is so much more quite than my previous one , but it does get somewhat warm .  
2	  This is my second Harmony remote . I think these are the best ! My previous 3 year old unit broke after being dropped one to many times . I ordered the XBOX version to better control my xbox and media center PC . I went online and the Harmony software converted my settings to the new remote in just a couple minutes . No fuss , no worries - GET A HARMONY  
1	  I should have listened to the reviewer who said the motor was noisy . I 'm very disappointed with this cassette player . I like to listen to relaxation tapes at night , and I need to move the unit far away from me just to use it , because otherwise the motor sound is too distracting .  
2	  those headphones are inexpensive and fits OVER the ear so it doesnt hurt to wear them for long periods of time . Bass is ok and sounds are crisp but for some reason the volume always seem to be alittle lower then the setting  
1	  There is a reason why this is only 20 $ . I bought this because all I wanted was something to play CDs .. It isn't skip proof so when ever you even touch the CD player it will start skipping .. I recommend this to the people who have a flat , stable surface , a small money purse , and an mp3 player . This should only be bought so that you have a way of testing the CDs you may or may not want .. I love my CD player anyway ..  
2	  Heard about these speakers on XM Radio and decided to buy and try them . When I got them was surprised at how easy to connect and the sound . Sound is just Fantastic . My laptop never sounded so good with all the music I have downloaded . Recommend these to anyone useing a laptop at home .  
2	  CAMERA STYLE PHOTOS / VIDEO - WORKS GREAT , BUT BATTERY LIFE SEEMS TO BE SHORT . MAKE SURE YOU CUT THE CANCORDER OFF YOURSELF RATHER THAB WAITING FOR IT TO CUT IT 'S SELF OFF IS THE OLY ANSWER THAT I KNOW ..  
1	  Picture of Product on WEB Page shows two 27 Black cartridges and one tricolor cartridge but eventually the product description does say it is only one each . I feel like the discrepancey cost me the price of one cartridge .  
2	  Don't be fooled by any " naysay " reviews . This is one easy wireless card to configure with a Linksys WAP11 wireless access point . I just setup my wireless network using a WPC11 PC Card with the WAP11 and the Linksys WDT11 wireless PCI card adapter ( which allows you to use your WPC11 card interchangeably with a desktop PC ) , and everything configured itself pretty much automatically under Window 98 . The setup manuals are very easy to read and understand . If you had any qualms about setting up a home wireless network , trust me : thanks to Linksys , this is not rocket science at all . And now that I 've setup my wireless network .. I am truly amazed at how FAST this wireless technology works . Hooked up to our cable modem , I can't tell the difference in internet access speed between my wireless PC and my PC that 's connected directly to the modem . Bottom line : Linksys is quality and worth the extra money over any cheaper competitive products , such as from D-Link . Neither this product nor the other Linksys wireless network products I mentioned will disappoint .  
2	  I 've had my Kingston drive for about a year now . It 's in my pocket with my keys and change all the time except when the drive is plugged into a computer . Unlike other flash drives I 've had , the Kingston shows little wear from this treatment . I have not run into any hardware or software compatibility issues . It 's worked in every ( Windows ) computer that I 've plugged it into . It 's pretty compact ; I can plug the drive into a middle USB port and not physically block the ports above or below it - which is a problem I 've had with other drives . I use the drive to keep items that I 'm working on so I can work on them from either home or work . Summary : The drive capacity is big , plays well with other hardware and software , and it 's sturdy . If it were not noticeably slower than other flash drives I 've had , I 'd give it five stars . However , the lack of speed is not a huge deal in the long run . It 's just a little slower doing writes than faster ( and more expensive ) drives . - BillPS : Some have mentioned about the cap potentially getting lost . That is not an issue to me , as I 've found that the cap will securely snap on the other end of the drive when you take it off ..  
2	  So far , I am very pleased with my purchase . It is quite the upgrade from my 6 year old imac ! Everything seems to be functioning great and I love the look and feel of it all . The magnetic power plug is very smart and Photobooth is a lot of fun to play with . I was disappointed when it didn't have a firewire cable included and I had a heck of a time transferring files from my imac .. P.S. if you can't open your old computer 's harddrive that comes up through firewire onto your macbook 's desktop , make sure that both computers have the latest version of Firmware on it . ( It took over an hour for Applecare to suggest that to me on the phone . )  
2	  Battery was a replacement for a 5yr old camera . Brought needed new life into the camera . Got here very quickly .  
1	  the rubberized fan mounts are completely useless on these fans . I ought two fans , but ended up only using 1 . the fan mounts from the first fan essentially disintegrated and the connection to the case within 2 days . Thought it might be the fan , so I replaced the mounted fan with the unused fan and used the mounts from the second fan . those mounts broke apart in the exact same fashion within 3 days . I am now running my computer without the top and fanless while I search for more fan mounts .  
1	  It 's simple . The fan is loud . It gets louder . I call . They say , " Sure we 'll replace it for a $ 30 fee ( oh , and you have to front the cost of another card since we don't trust you to mail the old one back on your own dime ) . " Thanks guys . I 'll remember to tell my friends about you .  
2	  We need to keep our camera heads clean to insure the best recording quality . This little tape is an excellent tool to do just that . From time to time we still need a factory service and alignment , but this little take extends that period between major service giving consistently better recordings  
1	  This bag has protected my 17 " laptop very well ( so far ) . The telescoping handle is nicely designed . The shoulder strap is very comfortable . Plenty of room . On one flight I used the plane-side check-in , when the bag was returned the rubber handle was broken ( the bag wasn't overly heavy , I am amazed that it could be broken ) . So the broken handle joined virtually all of the zipper pulls which have broken over time . I suppose I will have to buy something to replace the pulls , and maybe there is an adhesive stronger that the original rubber in the handle ( doubt it ) , but for the price of the bag it has not faired well over time .  
1	  straight out of the box and connected to phone line & computer / great . sync with computer / cool . Connecting to Internet / not so good .. yetAT & T ; in area not so good ; blaming problem on modem .. still working with AT & T ; customer service .  
1	  The first and so far the only pack of 25 Maxwell DVD-RW 's I have opened contained DVD 's that were unusable . The DVD blanks would not record , over fifteen of them had to be thrown away . I have not contacted the vendor since I no longer have that info handy , but I will research it and contact him ( or her ) . So far the few DVD 's that did record , when played back , the DVD froze ever few minutes , making it unwatchable and so unusable . I have not opened the other three packs of 25 Maxwell DVD 's I purchased , but anticipate the identical thing happening with them . Something is very wrong here . Aren't DVD 's tested before being sent from the factory ? Dr. J.W. Durrah  
1	  I read the positive comments and reviews of this product and took a bold step to buy this latest Product . The batteries are real useless so to say they completey discharge when idle for only a few days . The battery requires to be charged a few minutes before every single use of it which is impossible in my case . Even if the batter is idle for a couple of days after they are done charging , you will see it dead . Ultimately I am not make use of this battery . Not sure if its the battery problem or the charger problem . Really frustrated and disappointed of this product .  
2	  Hi , I just took this stylish little camera on a three week tour of the UK . It performed very well over the entire trip and provided me with over 800 quality pictures . I really enjoyed the cameras small size ( fits in a baggy pocket ) and ease of use . Overall , a very good camera . For people looking at buying this camera there are three things that are very important to note before you purchase : 1 ) Because this is such a SMALL camera , the lens is also small . If you are used to a larger digital camera , with a larger lens , this one will NOT take quick , sharp indoor pictures in most cases . Expect to hold the camera VERY steady or place it against a stable object . If you can live with this it provides fair to good indoor pictures ( in comparison to other , larger digitals ) . 2 ) The flash on this camera is very , very strong . Hard to believe considering it 's size , but it is . I try to never use the flash , the pictures just turn out too bleached . 3 ) This is my biggest complaint , and the reason I gave it 4 stars . This camera has no battery meter ! You only get a warning that the battery is low , and at that point you only have between 4-15 pictures left ( depending on LCD and flash settings ) . This requires you to either have an extra battery or just miss out on important events . This is a huge problem if you are on a trip without an easy place to charge your battery . You 'd think canon would have figured a battery meter out by now . I didn't find out this important fact until after I had mine . Hope this helps !  
2	  Its getting real boring say the same thing over and over . First rate on service and first rate on quality .  
1	  These are only TDK branded , made by Daxon . Media code Daxon AZ3 . Those expecting TDK quality , prepare to be let down . I 've had better luck with HP and CompUSA branded media .  
1	  Really slow , low quality , crappy software and no power switch . And good luck getting technical support ! My emails got bounced and I could not get through on the phone . Oh , and Epson offers you a " free " web space to post your photos .. I read the fine print and it says that you lose your rights to pictures you post ! Epson can claim your photos as its own and use them without even acknowledging you , let alone compensating you . So here 's the summary : bad product , bad service , and they try to take your photos for themselves !  
1	  My SureShot 105 provided me with 3 years worth of beautiful photos . Then one day , the camera failed to turn on . The camera was never dropped , shaken , or exposed to moisture , and the battery was new . A camera shop estimated a repair cost of $ 75 . I lamented my camera 's short life until I saw the " made in China " label on the box .  
2	  Bought this for my computer and did not realize it is really for a landline phone . It is lousy for my cell phone and does not work on my computer . If you have a phone with a earphone jack this may be the unit for you . Also check the jack size , I had problems with the sizing . Had to use an adaptor .  
2	  Shipping policies , which weren't a problem have changed since I bought my pinnacle pctv deluxe usb with remote . But as far as the product goes , I couldn't be happier . It does exactly what it says , and doesn't crash . It records cable tv , nad has RCA & S-Video ( inputs ) , which can be recorded from . The remote does work , which I have read posting else where saying it doesn't . The slight draw back is that the tv application has to be selected ( highlighted ) on your task bar for the remote to work . As far as the remote , it 's cool looking , has many options , and allows you to control the station menu on the monitor . The unit itself is compact , and very handy b / c it 's external ( usb ) . The software is decent ; for real time tv viewing , great . The timelapse ( like TiVo ) , works great too , and a conversion program ( included ) converts them into vcd , svcd , mpegll ps ( DVD ) . The program also can burn them straight to cd / dvd ( haven't tried yet ) if u have dvd writer . The recorder scheduler is ok , messes up occasionally , but works . Overall , a great product , but like I said : SYSTEM WILLINGI have a dell dim 8100 Pentium 4 1.7ghz w / 256mb ram , and 45GB storage . It runs good on it , but I probably wouldn't want to have any less .. newer computers would prolly run awesome with it . I think one big factor is having usb 2.0 . I have 1.1 and it runs good , but maybe with usb 2.0 a slower system could run well with it . I 'm planning on buying a usb2.0 card soon , but haven't so I don't know . You definately need a good amount of storage . I 'd say a good 20Gb .. more or less depending on how much you record , and how often you delete old pctv video files ( easy to do , use gallery ) . The video files can get pretty large , especially if you are recording in hi qual .  
2	  Great camera for portability . Fits nicely in a pocket , holder on your belt or in your hand . The picture quality is not Ansel Adams but then again I 'm not Ansel Adams . Good for work and random pictures anywhere . Would buy another one at any time .  
1	  They mentioned in their product review : " Optically clear , non-reflective film ensures long-lasting , crystal clear screen images " I got tricked into thinking that they have an anti glare film . When i used it , it was a normal screen . Nothing " non reflective " and " optically clear " . Waste of money  
1	  I used an HDMI cable to hook up the Philips DVP5900 DVD player to my brand new Philips 42 " widescreen plasma TV . Unbelievably a bright green stripe appears down the right side of the display on the TV regardless of what DVD I play . The stripe varies from as much as half an inch in width to almost nothing . I thought the issue was possibly related to the player simply warming up , but I 've had it on for three hours , and while the stripe starts out wide , and then shrinks to almost nothing at times , it does come back . I can't enjoy a picture which has a bright green stripe of varying width coming and going along the right side of the display . I 've e-mailed Philips twice regarding the issue and received no response , and the problem is not mentioned on their online support page . I checked the available firmware upgrade online too , and there is no mention of the issue or any fix for it . I saw another review where the user refers to a green bar , so apparently it 's not just my player-though it probably is related to the HDMI hookup and the use of a widescreen TV ( i.e. , you might not experience the problem with different equipment and a different connection-I just don't know ) . While I 'm here I 'd like to suggest strongly to Philips that if they 're going to sell their wares in the US market they rewrite their manuals and online support documents in comprehensible business English , dispensing of the mangled grammar , misspelled and missing words that tend to make it hard to figure out what 's meant at times . I 'm returning the player to Amazon , and apologize to them for wasting their time on this one . I 'd suggest they consider not selling this player unless there 's a resolution of this issue . CORRECTION , as of 2/6/06 : I wrote an updated review , but the system wouldn't allow me to enter a second review of the same product , only to edit this original review , so I 've added the update below : I wrote the earlier 1/14/06 review suggesting this DVD player was possibly faulty because of the bright green stripe that appeared down the right side of the display on my plasma HDTV . Since then I 've replaced the player with a highly rated Sony HDMI player .. and the green stripe has appeared again , though only about half the width-perhaps a quarter of an inch wide . So the fault must be with the TV and not the DVD player . I 've checked the Philips online support documents for the TV , and there is a document that mentions the picture can be off-center when using an HDMI connection , though it doesn't refer to any green stripe on the right side . What I 've found out in the meantime is that the TV 's picture format can be set to a fixed widescreen display when using a DVD , instead of the default automatic format , which will stretch the picture to fit the screen , and is useful when watching TV . The other night I watched the entirety of National Treasure ( a film I can highly recommend ) with the TV itself set to the widescreen format , and there was no issue with any green stripe . ( The National Treasure DVD was also in the widescreen format by the way-it was not the full screen version . ) My apologies for the earlier review , but then it would have helped if Philips had responded to my questions or had online support that addressed the issue . I don't think the Philips DVD picture quality was that different from what I 've seen with this new Sony player , so this Philips player might work for you .  
1	  I should have listened to the previous reviewer who said the iron was too hot - only one setting and my hair was frizzed for a week ! Maybe if it had another setting , lower , it would have been all right . I had to return it immediately . Could NOT use it . My hair is fine , and a lot of it . Maybe with different textured hair , it would be OK .  
1	  After two months it just keeps overheating ! Filter is clean but constantly shuts off . I have very short thin hair and this hair dryer has to cool down at a minimum of three times before I can dry my hair . Not very powerful , a waist of money and another item sent to the land fill .  
2	  I bought this to use with my laptop and it worked so great I have since bought a second one for my daughters computer . Especially appreciate the small size that fits most comfortably in smaller hands . Battery life is good even if you don't use the nifty battery shut off device .  
2	  I was just searching for a memory card to hold more of my pictures and videos since i had a 256 MB for my camera . I was thinking at least 30-40 dollars and came across this one for about 10 dollars total for shipping and the product ! I just got it today after ordering it on the 22nd and it is absolutely amazing ! I have a Fujifilm Finepix Z20fd and it is great . I completely recommend this to anyone . Make sure it is compatible with your camera first though . You 're crazy if you don't get this , however , because other stores have this priced for way more than 10 dollars !  
1	  The sound was fine . The problem was after less than 1 week if I paid $ 93.00 for them I do not expect the ear foam piece on the left side to come off from just removing them from my head . Amazon is very cool about returning an item because they are on the way today . Some people may think it is a easy fix but I looked at thinking if this happens in less than one week I am returning them I will use my $ 25 Sennheiser headphones until I decide my next decision but sorry it will not be a replacement of the same . Thanks Gin for your help .  
2	  I purchased this mic for use with the Karaoke Revolution games , after being pretty disappointed with the standard PS2 headset . It was definitely worth the ( relatively small ) investment . For one thing , I don't have the problem of getting the headset to fit on my head anymore ( yes , I admit it-I have a big head ) ; plus , as someone who does karaoke in real-life karaoke clubs , it seems a lot more natural to be holding a mic . On the more technical side , the Logitech mic seems to pick up a better frequency range than the headset ; I get much better scores on pitch when I use it . The only thing that prevents me from rating the mic as a " 5 " is that it 's particular about where you hold it ; it needs to be very close to your mouth , and held at a specific angle . Even with that caveat , I still will use it over the headset every time .  
1	  I have a SyncMaster 793MB which you can not use because of brown lines that appears . First I thought it was spesific to mine . But I had seen many SyncMater 793MB with the same problem .. So Samsung sucks .. How they can let this .. Obviously this is a production error .. They should annouce that they will change all 793MBs ..  
2	  good battery life , nice options .. simple to use . Doesn't have the bells and whistles of a more expensive camera , but it does what it is supposed to do to a high degree of success .  
1	  At $ 2.24 , I figured I 'd take a chance . After all , according to the reviews , it worked for at least some folks . Took the advice of one reviewer and bought from Eforcity to hopefully increase my chances . Ended up losing the gamble . Hope you have better luck .  
1	  * WARNING * This product is not for users with nForce Chipsets . I see users complaining that this product hangs and the keyboard acts up . You have an nForce chipset on your motherboard . If you are a fan of AMD and use their processors ( hence a likely nForce chipset ) , stay away from this product , because IT WILL NOT WORK RIGHT ! Aside from having to install a separate USB card to get it to work ( which I cannot do for my laptop ) it has performed quite well . I read many reviews about the audio quality , and I tend to agree . The audio will clip if I turn my PC volume up over the halfway mark . This is easily resolved by keeping the volume low and turning your powered speakers up . I would hesitate to buy another IOGear product in the future ( without extensive compatability research before hand ) .  
2	  Lowepro is a good name in camera bags . I say this because being a photo journalist for a number of years , I needed a good bag , and I rely on Lowepro .. The Nova 1 is an attractive , small ( maybe a little too small all black bag . it has a strong shoulder strap , good stitching , and a comfortable feel and look . Maybe I would include more pockets for extra film cases , ' cause I always have lots of film .. but for the everyday user that doesn't , it 's a good investment , and not too expensive either ! Lowepro = a name you can trust , coming from a camera expert .. ( self proclaimed ) =)  
1	  Noise , pops , crackles , hiss , sound levels vary based on input levels , in other words the sound is not constant , volume goes up and down ( especially with musical inputs i.e. drums or guitars when practicing ) .. I guess one cannot expect much more for 50 bucks and wireless .. ? stick with wired headphones , I went back .  
1	  This is not a Canon product - despite what the photo looks like or how the product is described . It 's a compatible ink cartridge .  
2	  If you have as many computers as I do , you will love this item as well as a four port KVM switch offered by Linksys . You can use one minor to run 2 , 4 four more computers and save a ton space in your house . I use this to run 2 computers with a limited desktop area . I use the 4 port for a file server , laptop and two other PC 's . It works great . Check it out for yourself .  
1	  The R15 came after the DirecTV with TiVo ( R10 ) . The R10 made DirecTV a clear winner ; the R15 has me thinking that cable or Dish Network might be a better choice . The user interface is OK , but is clumsy and clunky in comparison to TiVo . It has a few features that are pretty good , but instead of having their software people work on cool features , they should have had them working on making the R15 stable and reliable instead . At least a couple of times each month , I see it freeze , stop responding to the remote , lock up or restart itself . That 's not a complete list ; unfortunately there are too many malfunctions and performance problems for me to remember and itemize here . R15 problems are widespread : If you look at the tech support forums at DirecTV , a lot of different people in a lot of different places have had a lot of different complaints . It looks like a bug report database for software that 's not ready to go to production - yet they continue to push them out and hope that stacking " software update " band-aids on it will fix the deep flaws in the system software ( NDS has an unimpressive history and apparent lack of software dev talent ) . If you get an R15 , be prepared to 1 ) keep the details and paper together for the 30-day return policy , 2 ) be disappointed with the " downgrade " from TiVo , 3 ) use a power socket that 's easy to reach ( you 'll have to unplug it and plug it back in fairly often since it frequently locks up / freezes ) , and 4 ) adjust your expectation with the R15 's " normal " operation to give you picture glitches , change channels by itself , lose one of the two tuners ( comes back after you unplug / reboot ) , or any of another dozen malfunctions . Before getting stuck with one of these , definitely look at other DVR & service provider options , and consider the R15 as a last resort .  
2	  After upgrading from standard 8mm tape to MiniDV I could not be more happy . Very simple to operate for a novice , but the more I learn the better I am in photo situations which used to leave me flat on my face . Menus , manual parameters , automode , optical stabilization , 3 CCD 's , and the design and ergonomics are great . My only gripe is the poor response in low light situations . My previous sonycam did MUCH better . I better invest in a light .  
2	  BE WARNED - that not all of these players come with the DVI cable . I purchased my through Amazon . com last week and mine did NOT come with a cable . I purchased the $ 100 Monster Cable . The picture quality of the player is impressive , especially in 720p mode . Quite a bit more information is transferred to the television in that mode than in 420p and there is noticeably more film footage displayed . Overall , the player is probably worth the investment if you have a DVI capable television . Just remember , this player may cost you $ 229 plus $ 100 if you are one of the unlucky ones ( like myself ) that does not receive the cable in the box . Amazon and Samsung really need to rectify that inconsistency considering how expensive that cable is .  
2	  First off I purchased my unit from another source who bench checked it for me before they shipped it just to make sure I was getting a good unit , and it is . This little radio is simply amazing and out preforms my $ 300.00 + Grundig Satellite 750 , and it does it with just the whip antenna and inside my house to boot , and outside with a 30'simple wind up antenna attached it is simply amazing , and the AM side is wonderful also . Buy this little radio you wont regret it . ( PS ) I have found that if you use a pair of descent stereo headphones like the ones you use on airplanes it improves this radio 100 % when listening to AM / FM and SW stations making them much more clearer then when using the little junk internal speaker , in fact I have found that it is the only way you should use this radio .  
1	  It worked fine with my mouse , wireless adapter and USB drive . It did not work with either of my external hard drives which both have 2 USB cords , one for data and one for power so clearly it doesn't carry enough juice for the hard drives . I have a spider type adapter that works fine with all my devices and it was about half the price so I 'll get a few more of those . I also had a hard time squeezing my USB drive in next to another port so the ports are just a little too close together . It installed itself without any issues and is nice and compact so it may be ok for some .  
2	  Sound great and at a great price , I used them all summer and i sweat alot when I do my cardio outside .  
1	  This was a gift for my husband . It came in 4 pieces , and looked like it had been opened , returned and sent back out . Going back to AMazon tomorrow , Will try to review when we get a complete one  
1	  Looking for an FRS radio and GBS in one unit ? This is not it - Yet ! FRS communications are garbled and intermittent betweenother 120 's and Motorola handhelds . Per Garmin support , microphone and speaker have problems workingtogether . Software fix to adjust mic gain fail to fix the problem . I hope there is a hardware fix soon . Had to return two units . To be fare , the GPS works well and has lots of nice features . The serial interface also functioned with Topo USA well . I Truly look forward to a unit that works as advertized .  
1	  I got this scanner and hooked it up to my PC with no problems . It scanned really good images from photos until .. I had noticed large specs on the photos in the same areas each time . I read the instructions on cleaning the glass and scanned again .. but they were still there . Upon further examination of the glass , there were large particles of dust underneath the glass with no way to get it out . I contacted Canon directly and they said it was " anti-glare treatment " applied under the glass . Whatever ! The Canon rep said I would be compensated under their warranty terms for a refurbished scanner of the same kind . I told them to take a flying leap ! Never again will I buy a Canon product !  
2	  Being as inexpensive as these things are , there should be no hesitation in buying them . They are fantastic . I primarily use these with my PC for playing games and such . These were intended as a replacement for a USB set that I had . I wanted proper headphones to use with my new Xonar soundcard . The USB " gaming " headset left a bit to be desired in the area of build construction , so I spent a bit of time looking around the net for solidly built headphones . I am very happy with the dual wire headband of the RP-HTX7 headphones . So in that regard , these things are a winner , no frills and solidly built . I have no worries about them falling apart . Ofcourse I was also interested in sound quality . I 'm no audiophile , but I do want the best bang for my buck , and it seems that these things win there too . Prior to these , I was using a pair of Fostex T40RP monitors that I had on loan from my brother . The first thing I noticed upon pluging in the Panasonic RP-HTX7 , was noise . This is something I didn't detect with the Fostex phones . The problem was unrelated to the phones , and I was happy to hear that it was detactable with the Panasonics . These things seem to be bass heavy , and tend to blanket the mids and upper mids . But bringing those mids up in the equalizer really brightens these things up a bit , so it 's not an issue . I am very happy with the sound quality . As for comfort , these are near perfect . These are light as a feather , and the padding rests completely on the head around the outside of the ear , so there isn't any uncomfortable pressure on the ear lobes . The only criticism I do have , is that the the cord is fairly short . So an extension wouldn't be a bad idea . I wouldn't think twice about buying a second pair of these . I am extremely happy .  
1	  I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 17 " MACKBOOK PRO i7 MODEL . THE SIDE PORTS DIDN'T EVEN LINE UP , ALSO WHEN I DID GET IT ON , THE TOP HALF SNAPED OFF EACH TIME I CLOSED THE LID . THIS DID NOT FIT MY MACKBOOK PRO 17 " AT ALL.I RETURNED IT FOR A REFUND .  
1	  I was setting up a wired home network , and it wasn't working . I replaced this one with a 3 foot belkin cable ( the blue one ) , and the network worked fine after that .  
1	  Only used about one month and it was broken . I had to back up data , reinstall OS and exchange the item with WD .  
1	  I purchased this camera from a local dive shop prior to going on a trip recently . ( I didn't buy it from Amazon because I needed it * immediately * . ) The casing seemed solid , and looked like it would seal well , but I never ended up trying it under water , didn't take it on my trip , and returned it as soon as I got back . The problem was noise in the image . Under reasonable shooting conditions - indoor with a reasonable amount of lighting , plus flash , at the " ISO 100 " setting , the noise was intolerable . It was worse than I 've seen at ISO 800 or higher using name-brand ( canon , etc . ) dry-land low-end consumer digital cameras . To demonstrate this , I 've uploaded a sample image ( cat at water dish ) . In my experience with underwater shooting with disposable cameras and an occasional underwater " consumer-grade " rental , there are enough things underwater which show up as visual noise on pictures - little bubbles , silt , water salinity variations , etc . I suppose there 's an argument that says that the camera being noisy will , therefore , not have much of an impact . My feeling is that adding a lot of noise will just make the image that much worse . My feeling is that the ISO 100 results were unacceptable , and shooting underwater would often use higher ISO settings ( which , for digital cameras basically mean more noise ) , so this camera was a no-go for me .  
2	  This battery took a charge and has been holding it for a few months . Better option than replacing the phone .  
1	  I now have two 40Gb players and have used them alot in order to fault find my Firwire connection problem .. I have done all the A-B-C 's off fault finding including updating my software , drivers etc but all without success . Both players suffer from a firwire connection problem . Windows XP dings when the connection is made almost everytime without fail , but the software which reads the contents of the player doesn't always recognise its been connected .. very fustrating ! Apart from the fact that I can't always make a good connection between player and PC I have another similar problem . After creating some Wav files internally through its recording feature , I can't always download back to PC when connected to firwire either . I may get a lost connection error box or the transfer will stop part way through and then tell me the player is not connected .. Even though I need to overcome these faults in order to keep the unit , I do believe it 's one of the best players of it 's kind .  
2	  I bought this product to go with a new Onkyo AV Receiver . It works great ! The only question I had when hooking it all up was that I could not find it written anywhere that you didn't need a separate audio cable from the Tuner to the Receiver . Turned out the cable that came with the tuner , ( a DIN type ) , provided everything needed . I still don't know why there is a Optical Out Audio Jack if you don't need it .  
2	  Received on time and in new condition . Got what I wanted and it works as expected .  
2	  I am by no means a professional photographer and might be closer to being an advanced novice . I 've tried out almost all the different features on this camera & I 'm convinced that this camera is definately under priced . Everyone of my friends that sees this camera perform keeps asking my how much I spent on this thing . The Zoom is incredible , the burst mode is faast . A lot of people didn't make a big deal of the color swap & color accent modes but I 'm a graphic designer & being able to do those 2 functions in 2 steps in REAL TIME is amazing for a camera . The Photos are sharp and crisp and in the 3 days I 've had it I 've hardly been dissapointed with any of my shots . I have yet to really test it out at night but it certainly performs like a champ in the day . Bottom line , buy this camera .  
2	  No complaints here .. the product as awesome , cleaned my records and got here in a real timely fashion . I will use again .  
1	  For some reason I thought this cable would fit an HP PSC printer , it does not . I searched for the printer I have and this came up .  
1	  Pros : - It 's about the same size as my notebookCons : - The cord attaches to the plug at the side , thereby keeping you from using the other usb port . - The fans stick regularly . Sometimes one , sometimes both . You have to get them moving again by sticking a paperclip into the blade and moving them . - The cord will break quickly . This seems to be a universal problem , because when I contacted Antec , they knew about it right away and would have sent a areplacement , except they were backordered for a month . - The " on " indicator light will burn out in about a month , then you won't know if its working or not . - It doesn't really cool that well . You might do just as well by setting your laptop off the desk by supporting it with a small strip of wood on each side , giving it about an inch of air space below .  
1	  The earphones were too big for my ear . I used them to work out and they kept falling out of my ear because they were too big . I ended up having to purchase Jbuds and they had several different sized covers and they fit in my ear much better .  
2	  I bought this along with the & # 34 ; Cable Matters Gold Plated Premium iPhone 4/4S , iPad 1/2/3 and iTouch Dock to HDMI Adapter w / Built-in Charger Cable & # 34 ; . It 's performed very well , I 've used it on a variety of LCDs and Plasmas and it 's done the job every time .  
2	  I only gave it 4 based on the brightness . However , you would have to pay $ 6000.00 + to get one any brighter with the resolution this projector has . I purchased and compared this unit with a BenQ PB6200 . The Benq PB6200 has 1700 lumens , is XGA resolution , has a 2x color wheel and is listed at 2000:1 contrast ratio . The SP4805 of course is 750 Lumens , SVGA , 4x color wheel , and 2200:1 contrast . Here are my observations : Using Conventional Cable TV feed . ( To a VCR then Svideo to teh projector ) . The BenQ is brighter . I would hope so , with supposedly twice the lumens . However you don't really get twice the brightness in reality . It is brighter , but not twice as bright . At the same distance from the screen , the BENQ gives you a bigger screen . I had it in 4:3 mode , which is the only acceptable picture for either of them for watching TV . The Screenplay 4805 picture had better detail . I actually liked watching it a little better because the detail was crisper . My wife and kids however liked the BENQ because of the brightness , and larger output . Now the DVD Test : Using Lord of the rings , the results were about the same as the TV test . The BEnQ was brighter , but the Screenplay was crisper , so it comes down to personal choice I suppose . The Screenplay does have 4:3 , 16:9 , and Letterbox . So if you put your DVD player in 16:9 mode , and the 4805 in Letterbox , it makes for a large fully filled screen . The Benq only has 4:3 , and 16:9 , so the same movie in 16:9 , still has the black areas top and bottom . However with the Benq 's zoom you can make it just about as large as the screenplay 's output . Bottom Line : The Screenplay sp4805 is made for a really dark room . In that dark room you will get great video / DVD output . Like a movie theater . The BENQ is brighter , and probably better if you want to watch more TV , or sports , and don't want to sit in total darkness . So it is a trade off . If you just intend to use your projector for movie night , then go with the Screenplay . However if you want to watch TV in a slightly brighter room , you will probably like the BENQ PB6200 better . In this price range it is a trade off . To get brightness and great resolution , you have to be ready to put out $ 7,000.00 to $ 10,000.00 or more , and I just can't justify that yet , unless I get a really big raise in the near future . Not likely . Now I plan on testing each of them with HDTV . I am thinking that with the BENQ 's XGA output , that it will match the Screenplay in HDTV . I will let you know later .  
2	  Works as advertised ! Ive used it on headphones but right now Im using it to control the volume on my computer speakers , because the way i have them mounted its hard to reach the volume control when i 'm sitting down .  
2	  I can't believe how easy this camera is to operate . I received the camcorder last night and was anxious to get some test footage of my daughter before she went to bed . To save time , I skipped reading the directions and went straight to fiddling with the camera . With absolutely no difficulty or direction I was able to snap on the battery pack , plug the camera to AC power , pop in a disc , and begin recording my daughter 's silly bed time antics . Now it was time to play it in the DVD player . A freind had told me that you need to " finalize " the disc before you can play it in a DVD player . So , after a moment of hunting in the setup menu I found and selected the " finalize " option . A little whirring and a grave warning not to vibrate the camera , and a few minutes later the disc was done . I placed the disc in the DVD player still believing this was too good to be true , but there it was . My daughter giggling and singing in 16:9 aspect ratio on my big TV , with no wires and no need to boot up my computer . Within 30 minutes of pulling the camera out of the box I was playing a freshly recorded movie without having to glance at the manual . I can't say enough about the ease of use . And , the quality is top notch . I 'm no expert but I have an older Sony Mini-DV and I 've been exposed to home movies made on a number of different cameras . The picture quality on this one is as good or better than any video camera I 've ever seen . But it was the sound quality that shocked me . As I sat watching my daughter sing on camera I heard her singing in front of me . Then , I was startled to hear the sounds of my wife and I laughing and coaxing her comming from the surround speakers behind me . That 's right , this thing records in Dolby 5.1 surround sound ! So far , I 've only recorded two discs worth of material , and I haven't even gotten into exploring the more advanced features of the camera , but it does everything I want it to do . Incredible ease of use . High quality digital picture and sound . The only drawback I see is the $ 5-$8 price tag per blank disc . But as one reviewer mentioned you can transfer your movie to a much cheaper full size CD-R using a DVD recorder or your computer . Then you can reuse the same $ 8 mini disc over and over again . Either way , it 's a small price to pay for such a convenient and high quality product .  
1	  Does a decent job at laser printing standard sheets of paper , but some horrible flaws :* First , if you print envelopes , just forget this printer . Impossible to print # 10 envelopes without crinkling them . Can't send wrinkled envelopes in business . I had an Apple Personal Laser Printer 20 years ago that printed envelopes much better . * The manual feed is very finicky , and allows for little error . Printing labels off an 8x11 sheet commonly misaligns , ruining the whole sheet . It cost me a lot of wasted labels , so not really a workaround to the envelope problem . * Making the networking feature work with XP is almost impossible to get working without calls to tech support , and even then , don't count on it . Had it working once with my laptop off of WiFi , but never got it working again after an OS reinstall . The idea that a non-power user without a firm grasp of networking could possibly get this feature working with multiple computers is laughable . Certainly not mom , let alone grandma . * Extremely unintuitive controls on the machine itself . Requires constant reference to the manual . My favorite is how , by default , it decides to re-send faxes that didn't go through on its own timetable . So , if you re-send the fax manually , it re-sends the first aborted one automatically and you end up sending two faxes if you don't turn this annoying feature off . Good luck figuring out how to do that . And I build my own computers . * Brother 's software package is horrible . The scanning options look like something from 1990 . Can't even decide where to save scans , it hides them in a folder in the My Pictures folder called " ControlCenter2 . " Oh sure , how obvious , LOL .  
1	  I was very unimpressed with these speakers . I was simply looking for a decent pair of speakers to put on my patio with an old low power tuner . With the loudness setting off and the Bass BELOW the center mark , the speakers rattle as if I were playing them for a party . I would not reccomend the purchase of these speakers to anyone who actually enjoys even decent quality sound .  
1	  This set started shutting itself off intermittently a week after I bought it . When the repairman came , however , it worked perfectly . Then 5 months later it started shutting itself off as soon as it was powered on , and this time the repair is costing $ 225 - for a set that 's less than 6 months old !  
2	  OMG , why did i wait so long , this is the most incredible and fun computer i have ever owned . you just plug it in and it works perfect , the screen is gorgeous , i dont see how i can ever go back to my PC . I love my 6 ipods and have been waiting to try a mac and finally took the plunge . My only regret is not doing it 3 years ago . If you are thinking about it , dont , you will love this machine . I would have gotten the 24 inch but they did not have it in stock . A totally amazing machine , that is also fun , and i dont have to worry about viruses . It even set up my home wireless system seamlessly and shared my itunes music from my pc just like that , i did not even have to click a button . most impressive  
1	  THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT I 'VE EVER BOUGHT ! IT 'S OLD , IT DOESNT WORK PROPERLY . THE AD SAID NEW , IT WASNT NEW AT ALL . NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE . I 'LL NEVER TRUST THIS VENDER AGAIN .  
2	  This product is great ! I can charge two devices at once , or I can charge my phone in the car while the passenger charges theirs . This took quite a while to get delivered , but once it did it was used almost everyday . Unless you ride alone , this is a MUST BUY .  
2	  I am running a laptop w / Windows XP sp2 . It came Bluetooth ready . I never could install the software that came with the mouse . Honestly I don't know what differance that makes because it works fine without it . Perhaps I don't have some of the available functionality , or maby I am saved from unnecessary software . For me the primary shortcoming is the lack of third button . I use a third button for an escape key . I sorely miss this feature . Otherwise it is a very smooth , comfortable mouse and it seems to have good battery life . It uses regular batteries which I prefer to rechargable . They last a lot longer and I get tired of messing with the cables and extra hardware . I always have extra AA batteries around so this works good for me .  
2	  I like dealing with Amazon-I 've never had a problem-this product so far is great ! - got a great review while researching it-the only problem I had was with the company that delivered it-they called to set up a date to deliver and came the day before-luckily my husband happened to be home-CK  
1	  I used the unit to listen to iPod and MP3 players . The sound was OK at first but soon became weaker . Then , the iPod docking station wouldn't make a power connection . Finally even the MP3 players started to sound like they were & # 34 ; stuttering . & # 34 ; I tossed it in the garbage rather than go through the process of getting it repaired or replaced with the same unit . I purchased a couple of other Speaker Docs . to replace this . Cannot recommend based on my experience .  
2	  Very portable , pleasant appearance . Works great for my needs . Over-all very happy with this purchase .  
1	  Skip the heartbreak and don't buy . This lens ' manual and auto focus stopped working after a couple months of use . No falls , no bumps , nothing .  
1	  " Million-Dollar Looks for $ 100 " - Analog w / digital display receivers do not have the stability of digital phase-locked loop ( PLL ) receivers . I opened up the back of the radio , before returning it to RadioShack - it was mostly hollow inside , very cheap , low-grade plastic , and with 1960s-grade electronics . The front filter and band switches and tuning knob are flimsy . When putting the radio back together , I was very careful not to over-tighten / cross-thread the screws , but as soon as , one of the screws started to tighten down , the plastic started to crack . Because of the very cheap quality construction , the radio is very light out of the box , until the 4 " D " size batteries are inserted . The filters do a minimal job and only muffle the very good audio . The RF gain control can always be set on maximum , so it only acts like a DX / LOC switch . Even the newer model drifts off the tuned frequency , despite a kludged fix , that only causes ergonomic problems - once a frequency locks on , it still drifts , causing one to have to retune way past the desired frequency , to break the lock . The S350 has significant tuning backlash , which is partly responsible for the frequency drift . There are images all over the SW bands , being a cheap , single-conversion superhet . There are no station memories , so anytime the band selection changes , the radio has to be retuned to the desired frequency . The speaker grill is plastic , the digital readout is low-resolution , the antenna doesn't lock into place , and the carrying handle is cheap , smelly , imitation-leather . Instead , I bought a Radio Shack AM / FM ( for AM DXing ) model 12-898 for $ 25 ; it has digital PLL tuning ( prevents drifting ) , DX / LOC switch , hi / low tone switch , 3 " speaker with metal speaker grill , internal ferrite-bar antenna , lock switch , 20 station memory , almost as sensitive as the S350 , and much better quality - even the antenna locks into place . Don't be fooled by the " Grundig " name - it used to be made in Germany , but is now made in China , by Tecsun / Eton . Check out the Tecsun / Eton brand of this radio on Amazon ( same junk ) , and show , " lowest rating first " , also , look at the reviews for Grundig G2000A . Tecsun / Eton is becoming known for marketing jazzy , pretty radios that are poor quality / performers ; they bought the rights to market products , under the " Grundig " name , hoping consumers will think they are still made in Germany . With all that being said , with the restructuring of the 50K watt clear-channel AM stations , in the 1980s , AM DXing is not what it used to be , in the 1960s and 1970s . For example , many stations out West now have to use directional antennas , that cannot be picked up on the East Coast . All the hype about the CCradio , Superadio II , and S350 being , " DX machines " , is nonsense , and with the clear-channel situation , certainly not worth the extra expense . With the Radio Shack receiver , I can easily pick up WWL 870 New Orleans ( 1000 miles ) , WHO 1040 Des Moines ( 900 miles ) , WABC 770 New York , and my favorite , WLW 700 Cincinnati - same as the S350 . These stations can easily be picked up with standard car radios . For just , as little as $ 30 more , one could purchase the Sony ICF-SW7600GR instead , with digital PLL tuning , dual-conversion , SSB , and synchronous detection ; or , for $ 45 + $ 20 S & H ; , off Ebay . com , one could purchase a new Degen 1103 with digital PLL tuning , dual-conversion , and SSB ( the S350 has none of the above ) .  
1	  It 's adorable and I think it sounds okay when it works . I have 3G Nano 8 and have to reset my ipod to use it and be sure it 's fully charged . The unit doesn't come with the ac adapter , but they 'll sell it direct to you for 21.99 ( no s & h ;) tho . I am disappointed . I am going to try it with the adapter and report back . Buy with caution .  
1	  I paid $ 500 for these and treated them as such . They lasted three years until they began to short out and are now junk .  
1	  It works fine once you get it installed and set up , but pretty much every screen requires a restart which makes it pain to use .  
2	  This is the best ipod that has made Apple . I am very satisfied for my new acquisition . Congratulations for Apple .  
2	  We installed this little gem between the TV and the home theater amplifier . It took all of 15 seconds to install and it works GREAT ! No more blaring commercials from advertising morons who believe that boosting their sound levels makes you want to buy their products . We read some of the reviews where this product didn't work well for some buyers but when installed between a TV and an amp , it works flawlessly . We highly recommend this product .  
2	  I got this free with another order and it is a plus . It works great !  
2	  The speakers were easy to install and work well . For the size and price , they are a great deal . The bass response is not great , but that 's not what you are looking for in speakers like this . I 'm not sure they would be worth the original price at $ 250 , but at <$ 100 they are well worth it .  
2	  Purchased these because the TDK DVD-Rs I was using were glitching when playing back videos . No problems with the Verbatims . Good price . The disks themselves are not as attractive as the printable disks , but who cares : it 's the video quality that really matters .  
1	  I usually buy Fuji CD-R media , which are made at the Taiyo Yuden factory and have never failed me . I couldn't find Fuji media at my local $ - mart , but I figured that Sony media had to be about as good . Instead I learned yet again that if a brand has a contract with $ - mart , it usually means that they are simply stamping their name on cheap junk . These Sony disks use inferior and unstable phthalocyanine dyes . The quality control is terrible . Even at low recording speeds my Plextor and Lite-on drives often report recording errors ( aka : coasters ) . In contrast , Taiyo Yuden disks use AZO dyes , burn great , and never seem to go bad over time . ( Naturally , you should protect any CD-R media from high temperatures / sunlight ) . PS : If you have Nero software , start up CD-DVD speed and select " Disk Info .. " This will tell you the origin and dye type for your CD or DVD !  
2	  Monster iFreePlay Cordless Headphones for iPod shuffle is really cool , no hand , no cables , just put in your ears and enjoy  
1	  they are nice , but full power , don't expect more than 2 miles ( yes 2 , no kidding and intensivly tested : same result as a 5w CB with a good car antenna ! ) . to that , is nice to remember that they need license and license cost is around 50 bucks , so include this doing your math . the range claimed will probably happen in the middle of the rocky M. desert .. I don't understand why the can't be a little bit more honest and , instead of writing " results may vary " write : works few miles range in town . Ashame !  
1	  I bought ( 4 ) of these . ( 2 ) of them gave me red blinking light and the batteries didn't hold a charge . The other two went from solid red to green in 15 minutes . Placed the batteries on a voltmeter and measured less than a volt each . Would be ok I suppose for a remote control that uses little voltage , but this turned out to be a terrible waste of money . BTW - bought another charger ( Everyready ) that turned out great . Tried to charge these batteries in it and they still wouldn't hold a charge so I know it 's the batteries .  
2	  Unit was easy to configure . My network consisted of Win ME desktop & Win XP Laptop computers to Mindsprings DSL . The Win XP is also connected via wireless connection . Unit was placed into service within 15 minutes on both conputers after I finished reading the manual .  
2	  I wanted to try HD and now that I have , I don't think it 's got all the bugs out yet . Our four local HD stations sometimes just go away . The radio itself is good . Controls are easy . Reception is nil without the external antenna . The Boston Acoustic radio 's reception and sound is much better . I would give The HD radio idea another 6 to 12 months to fully develop . Maybe I 'll try an XM receiver .  
1	  I have purchased several styles of cases for several different iPod models over the years . This particular one is a thin , flimsy , cheaply made vinyl case with a zipper that is nearly impossible to close without ripping it apart . It will protect the iPod from scratches , but not from moisture or being dropped . My Otter Box cases do this , but none is available for the Gen 3 iPod . Don't bother with this case . Get a generic one at Target and deal with the access to control button issues as best you can .  
2	  I 've had a HP 1200 Laser Jet printer for a number of years . I especially liked it because I could put twenty-five or more envelopes in the paper feed tray and print away . After fifty-five thousand printed sheets , I accidently put a clasped envelope in the printer with the clasp on the wrong side . This action caused the printer 's print roller to be damaged and from that point forward it put a unwanted mark on every page printed . In spite of this mistake , I liked the printer so much , I ordered a used printer of the same model from Amazon . com . That printer arrived with thirty thousand copies made . I am now on my way to infinity with the resolve to avoid clasped envelopes in the future .  
1	  This is my second Zen Plus . The first one I used for over a year and still works . I bought a second with more memory but the backlight burned out within 3 weeks and it is nearly unusable .  
2	  First Of All I Have To Say That I Used To Have 46 Meg Of Ram And My Computer Ran So Slow That I Got Tired Of Waiting For Everything To Happen . I Had To Wait 2 Minutes Just For Programs To Load Up . I Finally Got So Sick Of It That I Went Out A Bought This Gr8 256 Meg Of Ram Card Made By Viking . I Opened Up My Computer Thinking That This Would Make My Computer Run A Tad Bit Faster . I Installed The Chip And Turned On My Computer . I Must Say This Has To At Least Be 20x Faster Than My 46 Meg Of Ram And That Is Not An Exaggeration . I Could Definitely Tell A Huge Difference And I Would Definitely Reccomend This Card For Anyone That Is Tired Of Waiting For Their Computer And All Their Programs To Load Up . This Chip Also Will Solve The Problem Of Being Able To Open More Than 5 Programs At Once . If I Ever Had More Than 5 Programs Open Before I Had This Chip My Computer Either Froze Or Just Ran Slower Than I Have Ever Seen Any Computers Run Before . With This Viking Chip I Am Now Able To Have Up To 10 Programs Open At Once Without Any Stalling Or Problems . This Chip Is Definitely A Best Seller And If You Are Thinking About Buying It , Stop Thinking About It And Go Get It ! I Promise You Will Be Happy You Bought It And You Won't Regret It !  
1	  Works but case gets very hot . According to Tripp , unit uses about 1A of power in standby mode . Since the batteries are charged most of the time , the power is coverted to heat . The case gets very warm and since I have mine in an entertainment cabinet , it just becomes a 120 watt heating element . I have several UPS units and this is the only one which gets hot . Its a poor design to waste 120 watts of power 24/7 . It only takes a couple watts to trickle charge the batteries . Tripp offered to replace it but stated the new one would have the same issue . I would not have purchased this if I knew it put out 100 plus watts of heat 24/7 .  
2	  Especially at Christmas time , the labeler comes in very handy and these wider labels are especially good for card addressing , etc . Recommended .  
1	  very hard to configure . was on phone with tech support 4 times to fix connection which was on and off . it worked for an hour then went back to multiple connection and speed problems . still waiting for consistent performance .  
1	  When you are an office that gets many dozens of cartridges a year , and none of them are suspiciously taped across the factory sealed end from the top to the bottom , you might think this is not an OEM cartridge .. no ? We cannot be 100 % sure it is or isn't but the taped end makes us think it 's not .. the seller claims it is to keep the box safe while shipping , You can decide for yourself if you want to make this purchase .  
1	  Greetings to all potential Creative customers , I was greatly disturbed today when I found out the lack of help provided by the Creative Labs Company to my wife when her 30 GB Zen MP3 player failed to run properly . In my opinion , it 's actions like this that are ruining companies and our country 's economy . Due to this company 's inaction today , they have lost a once satisfied customer . Once being more than happy to promote this product , now we will be sure to divulge to our friends and relatives of this company 's lack of helpfulness . My wife asked specific questions of the technical advisors in the e-mail form which were ignored ; she was given a form letter , was referred to the website , and was told that she would be charged by the company for further help . She expressly requested the guidance of upper management from the technical support specialist , and this request was ignored , proving that Creative Labs is unwilling to provide any kind of meaningful help and does not value customer service . The menial help that the highly flawed website provided was a firmware application that caused the device to completely fail , and then the last piece of friendly advice that we received was that we should purchase a new one from the company 's website . We were given an application that made our expensive device inoperable , and for that , I will never purchase another Creative product again . We have both been faithful Creative Labs buyers for years , and my wife had multiple friends and relatives buy their products based on her recommendations . It is with deep regret that I inform all that Creative Labs customer service has proven to be a bitter disappointment and for this , they have lost my family 's business .

1	  too complicated is not equivalent to " sophisticated " . if this item is not required for AIMR and not recommended by Schweser , I would definitely go with HB 10B II , which is the best , I think . When I use HB , it only took me a brief review of the instruction menu to get used to its functions , but this TI menu is not clear , and the calculation is complicated . I don't think it .  
2	  I 'm absolutely baffled by the previous complaints . It took maybe a total of 10 minutes to figure out how to insert the lock into my laptop security slot , then lock it . And I 'm not the most mechanically-inclined person . It works very similarly to that of a bicycle lock , which means the password is always whatever the numbers read as you inserted the other end of the lock and latched everything , then you just twist the numbers to read something else and Ta-Da its locked . The retractable cord is a huge bonus . My boyfriend actually " stole " mine so I have to buy him one in order to get mine back .  
2	  i purchased the furman mp-15 along with the floodstop for a second floor laundry room . i found the instructions overwhelming and not for a novice homeowner . i actually wound up following the review of another amazon customer who uploaded pics and a step by step of how to hook up both the furman and the floodstop together . i tested both units and they worked fine . the cord is very long and can reach if your main outlet is farther away . although if placed next to main outlet , there is a lot of cord to contend with . if you dont tie wrap it , it can look messy and get in the way .  
2	  I ordered this photo keychain for my wife . She loves carrying photos of all of our family and showing off our granddaughters too . " She " was able to load the program within mintues and loaded 26 photos within a few minutes . She took it to church with her that night and started showing off the family ! It is worth the points . Everyone should have one - good gift also .  
1	  It fits great with my Mac Mini , but it seemed to be a lemon from the start . It would often power off and not power back on for days . When it would stay on , there would be connectivity issues and no computer was able to connect to it using USB or Firewire . I had to return it to the manufacturer which took a couple weeks ( Iomega lost track of it .. ) . It worked fine once I got it back from Iomega but a couple months after its warranty expired , it no longer could power up and became a brick . Overall I 'm not terribly impressed with Iomega for its support and reliability .  
2	  As a connoisseur of cheap earbuds , these weren't terrible . I listen to a variety of music , and while it did very well on pop type music , anything rock fell absolutely flat . Vintage recordings were the worst on these headphones and I avoided listening to some of my favorite music for it . On sound alone I 'd give it 4 stars , but the bastards kept breaking into little pieces . Granted , the reason I buy so many headphones is from the fact that they all break on me in 3-4 months out of wear and tear - even the most pricey , which is why I stopped buying those - but I have never seen a piece of electronic equipment CRUMBLE like this before . It lasted the 4 months it did out of tape and glue .  
2	  This was a great buy . Really happy with the picture , sound , and ease of use . Size is perfect and as good as anything else we saw but much better price .  
1	  A word of caution , if I may . I 'm currently caught in theseventh circle of Gateway Customer Service Hell over anissue with my 400VTX laptop that is covered by warrantybut that the company refuses to repair . Their customerservice has been MONUMENTALLY bad , I 'm sorry to say . Before buying any Gateway product you might want toGoogle the words " gateway " and " sucks " . To date theyreturn over 800,000 results . Wow . Assuming as many ashalf don't have anything to do with the company ( a bigassumption ) , that leaves over 400,000 very unsatisfiedcustomers . Not a good sign . If you choose to go with Gateway please accept my mostheartfelt condolences .. and best of luck ! You 'll probablyneed it if something goes wrong with your purchase . As for me , soon I 'll be giving up on PCs altogether andswitching to a Mac . Sure , Steve Jobs is a jerk , but hiscompany makes beautiful , dependable machines . I hope ..  
1	  We bought this card because we needed an EXACT match for or existing 7600gt so we could run them in " dual SLI mode " . We paid a premium price and had nothing but problems . XFX support was terrible ! There is no support phone number and they took there time responding to our emails . There responses were worthless , they asked questions about our system , even though we had already given them a detailed list of our components and the error messages . We seem to know more about computers than they did . The documentation was ` BAD " and did not address using the cards in dual SLI mode . After an exhaustive search and trouble shooting the cards we finally figured out we needed to down load the SLI drive , pretty simple and should have been the first thing XFX would have recommended or at least addressed in the installation instructions ! Everything is working great now . XFX has not responded to our last email sent over a month ago . My advice , don't buy anything from them if you can't trouble shoot it on your own ! The card is working well , I 'll give it a " 4 " because of the price we paid to match our existing card , but I give XFX support " 0 " .  
2	  Bottom-Line : If you need an affordable , reliable , easy-to-install and configure 32-Bit NIC look no further than the Linksys " LNE100TX EtherFast 10/100 LAN Card . " For the past few months the unthinkable has been happening , my Intel Pro 100/1000Gbps desktop-class Network Interface Card ( NIC ) had been failing . I didn't want to believe it , but the last few days it has been none too obvious . The problem : every time I restarted the ( file ) server the NIC was installed in , the adapter flapped , that is the link was dropping for long seconds , then come back for a minute , then dropping the link again . The only way to resolve the issue was to turn the server off , unplug the RJ-45 cable from the NIC , turn the server back on , log into Windows , then plug the RJ-45 cable back into the NIC . After this procedure the NIC would stabilize . By not following the procedure the server would hang at " Applying Security Settings . " I played this game for the last three months until I finally grew tired of the drill . I caved in and slid my ( spare ) Linksys " LNE100TX EtherFast 10/100 LAN Card " into the PCI slot . Problem solved ! The 411The " LNE100TX EtherFast 10/100 LAN Card " is a high performance NIC designed for desktop computers with 32-bit PCI expansion slots . Right out of the box , the " LNE100TX EtherFast 10/100 LAN Card " is ready to run on both 10BaseT and 100BaseTX networks . The 10/100Mbps NIC can automatically detect your networks maximum speed and adjusts itself to the appropriate speed . The " LNE100TX EtherFast 10/100 LAN Card " also features Wake-On-LAN ( WOL ) a feature that allows you to remotely turn on the computer . The NIC is equipped with two LED 's ; Amber to denote a network connection speed of 100Mbps , and ; green ( Link / Activity ) to signal that the card has been connected to a network . The light will flicker when data is being transmitted and received over the network . The RJ-45 can accept a Category 3 , or 5 , network cable . First ImpressionsI am very pleased with my new Linksys " LNE100TX EtherFast 10/100 LAN Card . " I installed the NIC in a Dell tower computer with Windows 2008 Server Standard Edition . After the NIC was detected Windows 2008 installed the appropriate drivers ; afterwards the " LNE100TX EtherFast 10/100 LAN Card " was ready to use at full 100Mbps Duplex ; that is 200Mbps . ConclusionSince installing the " LNE100TX EtherFast 10/100 LAN Card " all has been well with the servers ' network connectivity . Though I have always installed Intel NIC 's in my server platforms , the Linksys " LNE100TX EtherFast 10/100 LAN Card " has proven itself a worthy " stopgap " replacement and one I might just keep in place over the long haul .  
1	  Only wireless keyboard or mouse that I 've ever had a problem with . First off - if I 'm transferring large files ( ISOs , videos ) over my wireless network , it destroys the connection between the wireless receiver & keyboard & mouse . Until the transfer is done , the keyboard doesn't half work , and when it does half work , half of the keys are mistyped ( I suppose the receiver doesn't get the full signal ) . Similarly , the mouse either won't work or works randomly . In other words , when I 'm transferring large files , I just have to wait for the transfer to finish to use my computer again . Keyboard itself - I have used the wired version of this keyboard at work for years and loved it . The wireless version is loved as well , with the exception noted above . Shame you can't buy just the keyboard but are also required to pay more for the horrible mouse . Ergonomics of the keyboard are great , and the signal is 100 percent fine except for the file transfers . Mouse - as bad as everybody says . The ergonomics of the mouse are fine ( although I find my outer wrist-bone to be rubbing my mousepad the wrong way sometimes ) . The mouse is not very accurate , does not drag across a desk surface or my mousepad surface ( Belkin WaveRest gel ) very well at all , and has wireless problems even when I 'm not transferring large files . My receiver is plugged into my monitor 's usb port and is located approximately 26 inches away or so from keyboard and mouse with direct line of sight for both . Summing up - I would not purchase this again . I was looking to rid my desk of some wire clutter , and in the future I 'll keep the clutter with usable hardware . * Update Two Weeks Later * Assuming my connectivity problems are due to the wireless in my house , I 've brought the keyboard and mouse to my office where there is no wireless . Same problems as before - mouse gets all crazy and the keyboard will just stop working for a few seconds and then type gibberish once ( I guess ) the signal catches on . Still absolute rubbish . Going back to the wired version of this keyboard ( which I now have at home , and still love ) , and a different mouse .  
1	  I bought the SporTrack Pro GPS about a month ago . The first thing I did was to download the new 3.02 software from the Magellan site . Follow the instructions and you won't have any problems . The second thing I noticed was that the database map is at least 5 years out of date and downloading data from the optional CD ROM helps some but its still old inaccurate data . I drove downtown ( 20 miles ) then used the GPS to get me back home . Most if the time the unit showed me off the road but it did get me back to within 9ft of where I started . I also noticed that the unit emits a high pitch sound when the light is turned on and gets louder when the light is set to high . I phoned Magellan and told them about the high pitch sound and they asked me to return the unit to the vendor . After getting a new unit guess what , it emitted the same annoying sound when the light is turned on . I went down to my local store and asked to see the same GPS unit . They all emitted that high pitch sound when the light is turned on . I 'm sure folks who use it out in the wilderness want every animial to hear them coming half a mile way . If I had to do it all over again , I 'd go with another manufacture . The vendor was great to bad I can't say the same about the manufacture ( Magellan ) . Magellan , your customers don't mine paying more for up to date software but they hate paying for obsolete data at any price . Magellan , get it together because your SporTrack Pro unit can be a real winner if you get your Mapsend data updated .  
1	  THERE IS NO WAY A 15.4 LAPTOP WILL FIT INSIDE ' THE SPECIAL PADDED CASE ' .. I think I destroyed mine trying to get it to fit in for a trip . I would NOT recommend this product .  
2	  Go to the Cisco / Linksys website first to get instructions on how to load if you have Vista . The seller shipped promptly and happy with the overall purchase .  
2	  The cord length and clip are perfect . The Headset fits perfectly and is easy to put on . The sponge for the ear piece is a bit large and rough . The volume is fine and the sound is crystal clear .  
1	  I bought mine 2 months ago , and for no reason at all , while i was taking some vids through my camera , it stopped functioning . I was unable to read the device and now its waiting to end up in the bin . The travelite works fine so far .  
2	  I just got the Logitech x-120 Compact Powered Speakers for only $ 9.96 with free shipping it was worth every dollar . The sounds is really great quality for loud or low music or other sounds .  
2	  Got this as a first camera and he loves it ! He took over 200 pictures on Christmas ! Easy to use and operate .  
2	  If you plan on buying a tripod and setting up some lighting for a particular shot and are considering to have the mirror locked up to reduce any shake , then take another step and get this remote trigger . It does have a limited range . So , if you want to take pictures of yourself and find that the remote is not really triggering the shots at your will , don't be surprised . Use the timer instead . $ 20 is not much of a price to pay for a product that can sometimes make the difference between a castaway and a keeper picture .  
2	  I bought three . All of them work fine , are very well priced and well worth the money . If you have a mac pro they fit the bill nicely making the limited in / out jack useful since as you already know it has to be pre-programed either in or out before use . These arrived as ordered and I recommend the source and the item as very useful . thanks for the great price . You made a friend .  
2	  This is a very good product . Nice sound and good noise reduction . Although it will not remove crying babies and loud people , it does a nice job of removing back ground noise . Good not great bass response but a nice well balanced sound . I would definitely recommend them .  
2	  A good solid camera ! I have the maxxum 7 film camera that the 7d is based on so the transition was very easy . I like the controls being out in the open instead of settings being buried in menus . It may look like you have to have an engineering degree when you count the buttons and dials ( around 25 , depending on what you include ) , but the controls are easy to learn as everything is clearly and logically marked . The anti-shake has been impressive . I have gotten acceptable sharpness from shots taken with a 300mm f4 wide open at 1/30th . Any panning or dragging the shutter seems to have better results with the AS turned off . With a fast memory card ( sandisk extreme II ) I get around 20 shots continuous before the camera slows to write to the card with a full buffer . A good camera that is even better now that the price has come down .  
1	  Let me preface by saying I am not the type of person to submit reviews .. However , I felt this one was justified . I read some of the reviews and was skeptical of this CD player , but purchased two of them anyways for each of our daughters . From the first touch of the buttons you could tell this thing was extremely low quality . Both , I repeat BOTH ( ! ) , stopped functioning properly after 2-3 uses . You had to press the play / pause button 4-5 times for it to register the function , CDs would not play through their entirety . Incredible . Returned immediately . Don't bother .  
1	  Seriously , take the $ 10 bucks that this would cost you ( with shipping ) and wrap it around your iPod . It will provide better protection . I have the 80GB iPod and this case does not fit properly , but even if it did the only thing that this " case " would provide protection against is a breeze , maybe .  
1	  I have bought ink catridges elsewhere for a while now because Amazon does not offer free shipping on this product anymore ..  
1	  Sony Premium Grade T-120 VHS Tapes used to be pretty darn good . These days that is not the case . The past few times that I have bought these tapes to record movies from the satellite dish , there have been to many flaws with the tape . One problem has been a line through the middle of the picture , like you sometimes have when you rent a movie thats about 20 years old , and also there have been jumping pictures , and small audio flaws as well . I use various brands of videotape , so I know that the problem lies here with the Sony videotape . Basically the record about as well as a tape you have recorded on over and over and over . They show too much wear way too soon . Get Maxell tapes instead .  
2	  I have used this cordless iron for 1 month now . Even though I only iron once a week anywhere from 2 to 4 hours , I love this iron . I didn't realize how much time I took by constantly having to move the cord on my old iron away from me . I always use the steam function and have found it to be more than adequate . The only drawback that I can see is that the cord on the base isn't quite long enough . I wish it was about 4 to 5 inches longer . Because of where I have to plug in the base and where I position my ironing board , the cord is hanging in mid air and I have to step over it or go the other way to reach my washer / dryer . I do " adjust " my article of clothing frequently while I am ironing it and putting the iron back on the base to " recharge " it is no problem and often doesn't even need to be recharged to get it up to the temperature that you are using . I would recommend this iron to anyone and ironing w / o a cord to fight is absolutely heaven !  
1	  I purchased this product about 7 weeks ago at a price of about $ 3700.00 with tax . You would think that at this price the product would be reliable the company eager to assist . I had a problem with the Lamp ( which costs $ 300 every time it burns out ) failing . When I called the warranty dept at Sony they stated it would take approximately one week to get the lamp in because they were out of stock ( telling me that there is a problem with this item ) . Since that time I have had nothing but a run-a-round from the Sony Corporation . Now i 'm told it will be another week and half and another department says it has been shipped , both the service department and the parts department do not communicate with each other and so neither one knows whats really going on . Then try to find a number for the Corporate Headquarters in New York ! Good luck . My advice is to stay clear of this product unless they find away to fix the lamp issue and have a competent business that caters to the customers vs blames each other ..  
1	  Just bought the Online Code for 1600 Microsoft Points and Viola $ 19.96 just disappeared from my account . I 'll say disappeared since the code doesnt work and my XBOX thrown an error saying the Code is Invalid ! What the hell guys ! ? This is just a stake towards a bad reputation !  
1	  I plugged it in the day i recieved it and every time i bumped the cord it caused lines on my monitor . Poor quality just went to bestbuy and picked up there cheapest ( about same price ) no problems now . Chunked this one in the garbage it wasn't even worth the headache of returning it , to me .  
2	  Folks , you are crazy if you think this is a bad product . Hello - you are buying a cd alarm clock , not a mini hifi system . The sound is just as good as the sony cd-853v , i know i have them set up next to each other playing . The volume - those of you who say you sleep through this , you need a fog horn . Again , it gets just as loud as the sony . Again , this is not a a mini hifi system . Bang for you buck , at only $ 60.00 this is a steal . You can adjust the alarm volume and you can dim the unit , read your manuals ! If you want bass , get a hi fi system . the best speakers in the world only use a limited sound range , that is why there are subs . IE - a speaker that proclaims to have a whole range is only middle of the road . You people are giving others the wrong impressions here . This is $ 60 , it is an alarm clock . Get real . It works perfect at what it is supposed to do .  
1	  all the effort you go through hooking up the serial cable to your computer is not worth the bad quality photos you 'll get from this camera . before you buy a digital cam think first - " what do I want to use the pictures for ? " . Go with a camera that has a flash and 640x480 resolution ..  
2	  Easily transform to suction cup mount from trolling motor mount . Where I fish most lakes are trolling motor only . When I go to river I change to suction cup mount and mount outboard on . Easy because not to many parts .  
1	  I bought these because I couldn't find my jvc set . These have the worst sound I have ever heard . I am not that picky when it comes to sound but these really suck . Plus they don't fit too well around the ear . They seem to stay in place ok but they always feel like they are going to fall off . My other over the ear jvc set is much better the ear size is adjustable so they stay on very well . I in no way can recommend these . Do yourself a favor and keep looking . You can find a better pair for the same amount of money .  
2	  I bought S20 to photograph my kid last year and I have not thought of changing to any other camera . The only problem it has , besides expensive print , is the battery life . I did not have time to do research on it so I kept buying 2CR5 batteries from Walgreen , which were like 12 bucks per piece . Until very recently I suddenly woke up figuring I needed to buy rechargeable battery to prevent those expensive one-time 2CR5 batteries from draining my pocket . DK110 ( the power supply which include the charger and the rechargeable NB-5H battery ) is an absolutely must-buy for Canon S20 users - go get it right after you bought ur camera . Of course the camera will be heavier with NB-5H but it 's not much difference . I have done this a year late but it will easily pay off in a couple of months for me . And also I would strongly suggest you buy an adapter for your laptop so you can simply put the CompactFlash storage card into the adapter and slide the combination into your laptop 's PC card slot ( CardBus II slot ) . It 's a lot faster than USB connection and does not consume any battery from your camera . The PC card adapter is from SanDisk .  
2	  what can i say it does the jobwhat can i say it does the jobwhat can i say it does the job  
1	  Read the other reviews about the mouse pointer jumping to the bottom corners of the screen . This mouse just FEELS wrongs to use , I threw mine in a drawer and now use my old Microsoft Mouse . This disappointed me , because I have always loved Microsoft Mice , and have an IntelliEye mouse at work that is the best .. Spend more money and buy another mouse , and dont throw out the packaging !  
2	  Simply an amazing product . Beautiful display with multitudes of intuitive features . This unit will certainly help in catching fish . Easy to set-up and use the first time out . This is my 4th Lowrance fish finder and each has been exemplary . It did take a little time to install but not too difficult . Very good installation instructions .  
1	  My Go 510 worked for only 1 plus weeks and had to be returned to TomTom for repair or replacement . I am very unhappy with the purchase . Ralph  
2	  I used these to replace the door tweeters in my 350z . They sound great and seem to have a decent range and clarity  
2	  Hey , for mere $ 149 + shipping , this last minute addition to my Eastern Europe trip , planned with a rental car , turned into a pleasure that really made me proud of my purchase . No maps , no asking directions , no getting lost . Fellow travelers , if you like to be effiecient .. think about it .. why would you drive a car without a gadget like this anywhere in the western hemisphere ? or even take long walk in a country where no one speaks your language ?  
1	  Although the detailed information says that the unit does have an S-video output , in fact , it does not . If you don't care about S-video , then it 's a good product .  
2	  I say , " Buy a camera with a good lens .. it brings the light in . " This HP850 really takes good pictures . I get close up of flowers , great detail , and yesterday I captured a Blue Heron in flight . I am a point and shoot amateur , getting results that are turning heads .  
2	  This is great for the novice or one with slots to spare . However , just a thought , giveCables To Go - 28300 - DB9M Serial Add-A-Port Adapter with Bracket for Intel Motherboardsa look . Connects to your COM port on the motherboard , bet you didn't know you had one ( fits only one way ) , and removing the two screws from the bracket allows you to mount anywhere you want to transfer the two hole pattern to drill , or if shame is not an issue , just feed the ribbon to the outside of your case and let the connecting begin .  
2	  I got this for use in my car . I hide my Ipod in between seats and the remote control takes over the commands . Easy to use and no problem for the Ipod to get the commands . The only con is that is hard to see the buttoms at night and hard to set tight in the wheel , otherwise , great product .  
2	  Very good loud sound , excellent for the gymm I know for some people it will be a strugle to figure how to put headphone on but it becomes very easy after awhile .. one drawback is that the bass isn't too great , but otherwise a great buy .  
2	  This camera is all-around amazing . The touch screen feature adds to the simplicity of handling the camera , so , it is very easy to use . The internal memory does not hold too much , but what can you expect with a 10.1 mp resolution ? Either a 2GB or 4GB memory stick will fit this camera perfectly . The pictures and video are clear , and the video is in MPEG format , for Windows or Windows Media player , which is terrific ( My Nikon camera has Quicktime video , which I find inconvenient when making video cd 's , dvd 's ) . The flash and shooting modes are good and the ISO is also good , although you can see some noise in the images when there is low light . The price is just right for what the camera offers . I am very satisfied with this purchase ! Recommended product , for sure .  
1	  Let me start by prefacing that I generally don't write negative reviews about products , actually I generally don't write reviews unless I have had a great experience with a product or a brand . However this has changed with these headphones which is a testament to how frustrating this experience has been . If some of you rethink your purchase because of my experience or if Monster actually decides to improve it 's product build quality or after sales support then writing this review would be time well spent . I had purchased these headphones towards the end of November 2010 and received them in mid December 2010 . I was excited to get my hands on the turbines as I had read many positive reviews ( and ignored most of the negative reviews about the build quality ) . The left ear bud stopped working properly in mid Feb 2011 . Yes that means that these lovely headphones broke down after less than 2 months of usage . Well manufacturing problems happen , components break down and life goes on . However it is the experience in trying to get service from Monster that takes the cake . I travel a fair bit so didn't get a chance to call customer service until the end of Feb 2011 . I was sent an email and asked to provide some information to get the replacement process started . I filled that out and sent back the email promptly . Three days after sending the email I had not received a response from customer service . At that point I emailed again to follow up ( a customer emailing to follow up on a customer service request as opposed to your company handling things in a timely manner , what a shock ) . I received a response the next day with an RMA number ( It took Monster 4 days to reply to my email and provide an RMA number ) . I was traveling so couldn't mail back my headphones right away . But I did mail them in two weeks ago . Since then I have been waiting for a response from Monster . UK postal services puts the time it takes for a letter to get from UK to Netherlands at 5 days so they should have received the defective headphones by now . However they seem to have not received the headphones . Upon inquiring it was mentioned by Monster that it actually takes 2 extra days for mail to reach their warehouse after it gets to the post office in Netherlands ( really 2 extra days ? ) A few things that stand out from this experience : a ) Monster customer service puts the onus on the customer to be more active in the returns / replacement / after sale service process ( not a good business process ) b ) Monster expects you to actually pay to ship back your defective products at your cost ( I don't expect to pay a premium for a product that breaks after 2 months and expect to them pay more to ship it back so it can be replaced ) . Why do I as a customer have to suffer due to your incompetence in product design and quality control ? c ) Loss of use during the time you wait for the replacement . I am sure Monster is aware of the bad quality of their product ( I mean you have to be if customers are complaining and sending in products for returns ) . If Monster isn't being proactive then its an even worse company to deal with as they are only interested in taking your money but not necessarily providing a quality product in return . A customer friendly process would be to send in a prepaid envelope that the customer can use to return the product and also send in the replacement to minimize the loss of use . As it stands I have only been able to properly use the product for 2 months in the last 4 month time frame . Rest assured this would be the last product that I buy from Monster . Their bad product quality and lack of care for the customer experience has turned me away from this company for good .  
2	  I have had this player for 3 weeks now and have since transfered all of my CDs to mini disc form . It 's awsome having ALL of Nirvana 's albums on one disc via LP4 recording . There are 3 recording options , stereo ( 80 minutes equals 80 minutes ) , LP2 ( 80 minutes equals 150 minutes ) and LP4 ( 80 minutes equals 300 minutes ) . The sound quality on LP4 with the bass all the way up is great . I can tell very little difference between LP2 and LP4 . It is so small it can fit in your pocket . I only wish there were more accessories for these gadgets ( carrying cases for the discs in particular ) . The only flaw ; each track can be labeled so you can see it on the " display screen " . Just put a CD into your drive and " MD simple Burner " will find the name of the CD and each track name . The problem is that only so many letters can be programed to a disc . Most of the time it isn't a problem , however when copying a number of soundtracks to one disc , when the artist and song name appears on each track , it quicly runs out of letter space . All you have to do is edit the track names and " dumb " them down ( eliminating the " the 's " , " Ands " ect ) . Albums are grouped together and are easily accessed , eliminating all the skipping through song after song to get to an album . There are 2 parts of the software , the " MDnet Simple Burner " used to burn CDs , and " OpenMG Jukebox " , which is used to copy MP3s to the device . The Open MG is hard to use at first , but you 'll get the hang of it . Oh , best of all . These babies don't skip ! You can put it in your pocket and run at full speed , crash your car , get into a bar fight .. and it plays perfectly ! :) In short , pitch your portable CD players . Minidisc forever !  
2	  I needed another plug because I have so many gadgets to power on trips . This works just fine for me . Service was good .  
2	  Thank you for fast delivery on the Epson ink . We will purchase again .  
1	  Every single tape rewinder I 've bought has died prematurely . This Kinyo worked fine for about a year , which is why it got 2 stars . But it 's the last one I 'm ever buying . From now on we 'll use old VCR machines to do our rewinding !  
2	  This was a very easy to install product , instructions were clear , craftsmanship is good . Its classic black look is exactly what we were looking for , and the price is very reasonable . Sound quality is great .  
1	  Got a pair of these for Christmas from my daughter . They had all the performance I could expect from a 12 year old 's budget - the sound was pretty good , though they need more insulation , and my ears are a bit bigger than the cans . Having wires running down both sides means you can't ever have the free side on the right side . They don't stay adjusted where you put them , and eventually one of the loose slider adjusters came apart and I had to pop-rivet that side back together . A few weeks later , the thin spot on the wishbone snapped off on one side , and when I looked , the other side was cracked . We managed to zip-tie things together until the other side broke . The plastic on the headgear is crap , and is what ultimately made them useless . The lid on my Costco laundry soap is made from tougher plastic - really . They still sound fine , but now you have to hold the two cans yourself . not sure what she paid for them , but think I 'll look closely at the headgear before I buy my next headphones .  
1	  Bought this for a friend , spent two hours unsuccessfully trying to get it to connect to the Internet through their DSL modem . Tried a number of different things , went as far as downloading and upgrading the firmware - no use . Brought it home , plugged it in place of my Linksys router ( connected to the cable modem ) - same story . I can display the router 's web configuration utility , but it just would not connect to the Internet . Should have spent $ 10 more on a Linksys product .  
1	  I have owned 2 iPods and now a Zune . I have always refused to buy the first year / generation of any product . First year / generation models are always buggy . I broke that rule and bought the Zune . I should have waited . The tonal quality does not approach that of a 5th generation iPod . The battery life on an iPod is far superior as well . The wheel does not work nearly as smoothly as an iPod either . The Zune was a good idea but it was not ready to go to market . I assume that if Christmas were not fast approaching they would have waited and improved the Zune a bit more before releasing it . They should have anyway . I gave mine to my sister yesterday and went back to my old iPod . When I can afford a new purchase I will get a 60 or 80 gig iPod video . Buyer beware .  
1	  I own a top of the line PC : Athlon 64 3500 + , Nvidia 6800 , WinXP Pro card , etc . etc . Pinnacle PCTV crashed the WinXP Pro during the install phase and freezes the Windows XP ever since . Both Pinnacle Tech Support and Forums Suport do not read the questions and send irrelevant answers . They also suggested replacing my PC - What a joke ! Don't buy it unless you are SURE that you can get reimbursed in full if it does not work for you ! Don't even dream on counting on Pinnacle 's support .  
1	  I have this cable installed on a CDA-9856 deck , using a 60GB iPod Photo . The interface completely circumvents everything that is good about the interface on the iPod itself . 1 . The controls and display on the iPod are disabled when connected the head unit . You MUST use the head unit to control the iPod , and you cannot see information about the currently playing track on the iPod . 2 . When searching through artists , albums , songs , or playlists on the deck , only one item is viewable at a time ( contrasted with 5 or 6 items viewable on the iPod screen itself ) . This makes it extremely dangerous to browse through your music while driving if you don't already know exactly what you want to listen to . 3 . One " tick " of the control knob on the deck scrolls through 1 item ( artist / album / song / playlist ) on the iPod . Scrolling does not speed up as you continue to turn the knob . If you want to scroll through 200 + artists , expect to spend fully 2 minutes or more twiddling the knob . While driving . I can't even begin to describe how frustrating this is . 4 . There is absolutely no way to speed up the process : there is no fast scrolling mode that skips through 10 + artists at a time , there is no way to scroll by letter of the alphabet , no nothing . 5 . When scrolling through items , the menu returns to the beginning of the list each time you pull it up . If you spend 90 seconds scrolling to " New Order " , then next you want to listen to something by Nirvana , have fun scrolling for another 90 seconds . It 's as if Alpine didn't bother to user test this system AT ALL with large-capacity iPods . It 's a complete embarassment and I will be returning it as soon as possible .  
2	  This is a very durable bag that works well for me . I can fit my XTi with a 17-70 lens and 10-20mm lens inside and carry two additional lenses on the outside pockets . The shoulder strap attachment buckle can make it difficult to remove the side pocket lenses but it depends on the size . My 70-300mm with hood reversed can be a hassle .  
2	  This MP3 player / radio is so easy to use and so small ! I have not found anything I would change about it . I run 5-7 days a week and it clips perfectly to the treadmill or my clothes since it is so lightweight .  
2	  everything it claimed to be . plenty of ports . lights to tell you which are active . no problems  
1	  The Boss tweeters did not handle the rated power at all . Pushed 100 watts thru it and they blew ( 2 sets ) ! Very cheap designCheap crossoverJust buy a better pair - yes these are inexpensive but youre paying for what you get . Save yourself the time of putting these cheap ones in that will blow and buy tweeters with better quality .  
2	  It did what I expected it to do . It came with a case that it sort of works with , but it works better when you take it out .  
1	  Worked for about a week , now doesn't . The tape remained in the stereo , so I see no reason for it to stop working . Upon inspection , it does look cheaply / poorly made . You get what you pay for , but still for the price I expect better . My recommendation is to just put the money toward a better product that will last . Good luck out there !  
1	  Let me start by saying I was really happy when I heard iPod was going to get some competition . But the Zune fell flat . After owning an iPod mini ( which I was happy with ) for about three years , I decided in July to get a new mp3 player . Hearing rumors about a full-screen iPod with touch-screen capabilities , I decided to wait . Then I heard about the Zune . A bigger screen than the iPod , WiFi enabled , AND I figured , as it is competing with one of the most successful electronics , it has to be very good . Wrong . The Zune is a prototype . I thin Microsoft rushed to finish it before the holiday season , and it shows . The WiFi isn't good at all , and there aren't enough other Zune-users to use it at all ( I have yet to find a good use for it , and I go to a college in the city ) . Since the Zune service ( one pro to this product ) doesn't have videos or tv shows , the screen size doesn't matter . The screen is clearer , but I am comparing this to an iPod mini .. so .. The color choices ( while limited ) offer some pretty unique things , but I agree with one reviewer that it looks like iPod 's ugly step-brother . It isn't cool looking , and it is semi-clunky . Another disappointing feature is the limited number of options . There are three Zunes , in comparison to I think over 10 iPods . There is no cheaper , smaller nano equivalent , and for those on a big budget , there isn't any shiffle or SanDisk size player . Microsoft needs to fix this . Now , a few pros . The Zune music Store has a subscription service . This is much more convenient that . 99 cents per song . Despite this tough , there doesn't seem to be much music available , and as mentioned , no videos . Like iTunes , you can only play these songs on a Zune , and you can only put songs on your player from the store . The back engraving is the final pro ( pathetic , yeah , but cool ) . " Greetings from Seattle ! " .. a smack in Apple 's face . Despite the engraving , this product isn't good enough to knock the iPod off it 's high horse . My suggestion is not to buy an mp3 player this season . If you were going to get one as a gift , give a rain check . Apple is rumored to be releasing an iPod phone in January , and the Zune lineup will likely be expanding too . Wait . The Zune will probably get better , and Apple appears to be making more technological jumps . Pros-Zune Store subscription-back engraving - FM TunerCons-bad sound quality-bigger screen is useless , as there few to no videos to watch-little to no WiFi capabilities-clunky and ugly-lack of modelsall I can suggest is to wait .. wait until 2007 !  
2	  Just got it as a gift and already cant be without it ! I take it too the gym , the office or out running . I am a fanatic for hi-tech stuff but this is really great for anyone .  
2	  Worked fine to transfer all data from the hard drive before sending my laptop in for repairs . I didn't need to go through driver installation procedures on the enclosed disk , just plugged it in and it was ready to go .  
2	  I haven't used the tablet enough yet to give a detailed review , but so far I 'm having fun with it . It performs about how I expected , plus it has a neat feature where you can write by hand on the tablet instead of typing in text boxes like the one I 'm typing in now . So far no problems .  
1	  Not much to say about such a simple device , other than it broke after a month of use plugged in without any movement .  
1	  If you are looking for a CD player this is a good buy , great sound . On the other hand , if you are looking for a clock radio pass it by . Radio stations that I cannot get and so difficult to set the stations that I can get . Controls for volume and the radio are on the side and not easily accessible . You don't get your moneys worth on this one .  
2	  After going through 5 digital cameras in about a month ( this was my 6th ) , I am really thrilled ! A fantastic camera , with awesome features . This is one camera which can satisfy both the novice as well as the advanced photographer . You can make the camera automatically adjust all the settings if you want to , or you can manually adjust all the settings . The LCD screen is 1.8 " big , and is cool . The best part is the batteries . It requires 4 AA batteries . With the 4 supplied by Canon , I took about 160 pictures , using the LCD a lot of the time . This was in addition to using it for playback , etc . This time , I am using the NiMH rechargables , and I have already taken about 200 pictures , again , using the LCD most of the time . Great job , Canon !  
2	  Having fallen in love with everything but the price for some Bose headphones I tried at the ipod store - I began to look for some similar " over the ear " phones at a more reasonable price .. These are the ones I chose , and I love them - good sturdy phones at a great price .  
1	  Remote does a lot , but is bulky . And the annoying thing is that the remote keeps losing its programming for certain stored devices . It is easy to reprogram , but sometimes it is as often as daily . Very annoying !  
1	  There is no such chip as an AMD Athlon 64 Processor FX 70 125 WATT AM2 . It is a socket F with 1207 pins , not 940 socket AM2 as the ad banner describes . Don't be mislead into believing this is the next chip in the FX Athlon series after the incredible FX 62 . It was an interim chip produced before the Quad core chips came out . The only motherboard I can find for it comes from Asus ( Even they don't guarantee compatability since the board was designed for an Opteron . ) To realize a performance increase over the Athon 6400 + , you will need two CPU 's , otherwise even the Athon 6000 out performs just a single chip . I do not believe any other board manufacturers are planning boards for this chip . There are ads all over the internet for the AMD Athlon 64 Processor FX 70 125 WATT AM2 , but none of them clearly indicate that this chip is a socket F. I believe there is a lot of inventory out there and this misleading banner is just an attempt to unload an expensive orphaned chip .  
2	  This is the second best thing that my sweetie has bought me .. the first was a first generation nano . I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't want the bulk of the ipod .. that is why I wanted the nano . It is sleek and so light weight I don't even know it 's there . Fantastic !  
1	  I 've been a great fan of anything created and sold by Creative . So this was a real shocker . I installed the card as directed only to have it blow my power . So , I replaced the power and started all over again . This time no problems with installation . I 'm using the Microsoft System 7 so I downloaded the update downloads from Creative . I 'll spare you the play by play . The card uses capacitors to approach kind of a DBX system . That would be great except you get a wavy sound that drives me nuts . Do yourself a favor and avoid this card .  
2	  There are lots of helpful remarks in the previous reviews . I 'll just add that the " 3-d " view provided by this and other Garmin units seems much easier to use with a quick glance than the top-down views on other units . Other than the size of the screen , this unit is superior to the nav system that came in my ' 03 Toyota Prius in every regard . It 's very easy to use . I should mention that my unit arrived about two weeks ago with system 2.1 on it . During our first trip using it , the unit froze while we were heading down Route 1 in central NJ . Power cycling it got us back on track , and we 've no other problems since . However , I just looked on the Garmin website and found that the current system for this unit is 3.2 , as of December 6 . Updating the system software on my PC in the office was quite simple , and I 'm glad that the unit will be ( presumably ) more stable than ever .  
2	  If you own an older Ford , like my 92 Crown Victoria , you will have bit of trouble finding a cassette adaptor . After several tries , I found that this product works the best . I don't have any problems with noise , feedback or " flipping . "  
1	  I had high hopes for this product but never got to try it as it would not read my xD card as promised . Be careful ordering this frame as it is impossible to return .  
2	  This is very well designed . It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides . This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides . You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right . The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles , it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires . It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go . It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices .  
2	  Other than the headpiece fitting a little tight , these are a quality set of headphones . Sennheisers are tough to top . I haven't found a worthy adversary yet . If the price is right , you won't be disappointed !  
2	  Simply the best and easiest digital SLR camera I have used . I have just purchased one of these last week - an upgrade from the 300D - and I have to say that the speed and accuracy of the XTi is fantastic .  
2	  Purchased these headphones well below retail and have been delightfully surprised . Sound quality is outstanding and the prestigious packaging made it especially suitable as a gift . Sound - Deep , powerful base and clear tones . I use mine with several iPods . Most of my music is saved at 256kbps . 128kbps is just too low to allow any commercial headphones to replicate the music with clarity and depth . Fit - Multiple buds allow for a snug , comfortable fit . Spending an extra moment experimenting with the different inserts pays off . Remember , your ear openings likely vary in size ( mine do ) so don't hesitate to select different inserts to customize for a comfortable fit in both ears . It 's worth the extra few minutes . Accessories - Carrying pouch is both useful and attractive . Really appreciated the adjustable cord clip which ensured a snug grip while exercising . Another nice touch were the thin color-coded bands around the base of each speaker - red for right , and blue for left . Easily distinguishable with my aging eyes and such an improvement over the standard microscopic " R " and " L " identifiers . Quality - Outstanding so far . These are the first " tangle-free " headphone cords that live up to the marketing hype . After stuffing them into the carrying pouch , I removed a tangle-free pair of headphones - sweet .  
2	  No issues here . I have purchased this item several times . I know there will always be defective ones , but I have never had an issue with amazon doing returns .  
1	  This monitor is the worst mistake I have ever made ! After I have purchased on Amazon . com it hasn't been working for a 10 single minutes . It 's been in the maunfacturer 's repair 2 times already . As soon , as it will get broken the third time , I will get my money back from my vredit card .  
2	  I got a new power mac G5 with 2.3 ghz daul core with 2 Gb ram and 250 gb hd and 256 vram . This is a major upgrade from my crappy dell . I bought this computr so I can flies from my ibook at school and put on the powermac then bring backthe file to my ibook . I also bought for games , photos , making music , lstening to music , making movies and much More . Once you are mac you never go back !  
1	  Handspring has a built in problem with all of there handhelds , they put in some cool features , and even offeres it at a resonable price . The main problem stems from the fact that you can't upgrade the OS , you are stuck with what was delivered , and if you would want to upgrade you will have to buy a new handspring that offers the latest .  
1	  I was not happy with this product . I had it shipped to me , and as soon as I got it , I had to ship it back . Paying two shipping fees of 17.85 is not worth your time . If you are going to buy this product , I suggest going into your local electronics store to look at it first .  
1	  I made the mistake of purchasing 2 of these units in the mistaken belief that the first unit 's misbehavior would be fixed by the replacement . They both acted exactly alike by consistently locking up every few hours . This required a power off and on to get internet access back on . I have since then replaced this junky gateway with a Motorola Surfboard gateway unit that performed reliably . It is unconscionable that Linksys would continue to make and sell such a poorly designed unit that is so obviously flawed . It is obvious by a simple google search that there is plenty of information about this typical unreliable behavior that they are just hoping for more suckers to purchase this unit . Well , don't . It 's not worth it .  
1	  If you don't really care about precision don't bother reading . The Turbo Mouse , despite its name , is another kensington trackball . It 's not as pretty as the orbit ( just gray ) but it is far superior to ANY trackball on the market and it has 4 buttons . After having to leave my old Turbo Mouse with a former employer I tried several cheaper substitutes ( FYI : Macally products are nearly useless ) but ended up spending the loot on the Turbo Mouse . Check it out .. take apart your trackball and look at the guts . The ball rests on low friction surfaces right ? Look closely now , they may try to fool you . The turbo mouse is the only trackball I 've found that rolls on bearings . Smoother than a baby 's .. uh .. frictionless surfaces . Oh .. don't even get me started on optical trackballs .. have you ever tried to use PhotoShop with an optical trackball ? It 's like painting with mud . But if you just use Word and EMail ignore me .. don  
1	  I feel misled by the rave reviews here and elsewhere . I jumped at this given the price and others ' praise . The latter was misplaced ; the former wasn't low enough . The MM22 might be fine for a hotel room , but it 'd better be a damned quiet hotel . I have trouble hearing the damned thing even when I press it to my ears . Yes , I 've found the volume buttons , and yes it makes a difference - from inaudible to barely audible . The design is cute , the carrying case is nice ( though excessive unless you need to carry all 3 cables and all 3 adapters , which you won't ) , and the price is low . But cheap is cheap , and this one 's not the effort .  
1	  The reviews of all other ipod fm transmitters that I 've seen were pretty negative , but this one had mostly positive reviews , even when not counting the one that sounded like a paid advertisement to me . So I decided to give it a try . What a disappointment ! There are several significant design flaws . There is a poor dock connector fit - it 's too loose and falls out at a slightest provocation . It has no frequencies display , so you have to rely on on ipod 's display , which was not intended for that , so you only see a frequency display when it 's plugged in and then it goes away . Besides , when ipod backlighting goes off you can't see anything anyway . The tuning is the primitive kind with tiny up / down buttons . But one could adapt to these limitation if it worked , but it does not ! In a car , now you hear it now you don't . When it does , the quality of the sound varies from bad to worse , defeating the whole purpose of having it . Tried it on a home stereo where there are better filters so it 's easier to find unused frequencies and presumably to lock in and transmit . Worked somewhat better under these conditions , provided I stayed close and in a right position . A step aside and it goes off . Like some kind of infrared device . Overall , forget it . Back it goes . I can't explain the positive reviews that some people left here . The quality of your car radio may make some difference . I can't recommend it , but if you want to give it try , make sure you can return it for a refund .  
2	  This antenna is well worth it for people with reception problems . I live in Point Loma in San diego and with a rabbit ear I can only receive channel 8 . With this antenna I was able to receive 34 channels including KTLA and NBC4 in OC .  
1	  This is a pretty camera to look at . It is small and compact . The problem that I find with the camera is that it does not like darkness , and the flash most of the time over-powers the subject . I found that you had to really read the book and understand the features of the camera before you could take some what of a nice picture . Only 3 out of 10 pictures that I take would I consider good quality . Other than that , my 1.3 megapixel sony 3.5 floppy camera takes just as good pictures . I don't recommend this camera .  
2	  After doing much research on the ' net and visiting every electronics store on the island , I decided on the HC30 and I am not disappointed . I 've never owned a camcorder before , so I was worried that I 'd have trouble using one , but Sony has taken away any hassle with its " Easy " mode , which uses automatic settings-great for point-and-shoot novice ( read : wannabe ) videographers like myself . Pros : Size ( this camera is tiny compared to other camcorders in this price range ) , Memory Stick MPEG movie + still image recording ( perfect for e-mails + websites , but not for prints ) , bright 2.5 " touchscreen LCD , good automatic settings , excellent picture quality , Super NightShot ( a MUST for single CCD cameras used in low-light settings ) , analog-to-digital pass-through ( for recording from a VCR onto your PC using firewire ) , Carl Zeiss lens ( hence the excellent picture quality . Cons : Menu navigation and getting to manual controls is not intuitive and can be problematic while shooting . The optical zoom is small compared to other cameras in this class ( 10x vs . 20x ) . It 's low-light performance is mediocre , but compared to other camera 's I 've researched and tested , the HC30 outperforms them all with its Super NightShot . And for anyone complaining about the poor still image quality , I will say that this camcorder , and its stills were not meant for prints , but for e-mails or the ' net . It 's a given that if you want good photo quality , buy a regular digital camera-even the most ambitious of camcorders usually only come with a one megapixel sensor , which is not nearly enough for crisp photos . Don't worry , this camcorder is small enough that you can still carry around your digital camera and not be weighted down . I 'm new to the world of digital video , but I 'm an avid digital photographer and I 've got to say that with its feature set and ease of use , I can readily recommend this camera to people who want no-hassles with good quality . Given it 's pros ( good auto settings ) and cons ( buried manual controls ) it 's obvious that this is meant for consumers and not prosumers , but with its excellent image quality and decent low-light performance , I think that even prosumers should think of picking this up as a good backup camera .  
2	  I was very picky when trying to find the ideal headphones for running outside and these have definitely met / exceeded my expectations . They are form fitting around my neck and with the additional " Clip " you don't even feel them when you run . Some people were complaining about pain in their ears when they were done running and I haven't experienced that at all . If you 're looking for great sounding , comfortable running headphones then I highly recommend ..  
2	  The mouse is great , accurate , clicked feels good . I like logitech mouse . Another thing is that I remembered when I placed the order , there is rebate , but I cannot find it anymore . Whatever , the mouse is great , but someone has to be careful that it is a mini mouse .  
2	  Just bought a x-73 and already own a x83 . The reviews on the x-73 really scared me , as I didnt read them till after I got the Printer . Had no problems at all with installation . Installed off the CD , and it all went smoothly . My OS is WIN-98-SE . I think both the X73 and X83 are great machines , and at a bargain price ! I give 5 stars because of price and quality-I don't quite understand the installtion problems mentioned .  
2	  I have tried 4 different FM Modulators ( Transmitters ) to use with my I-pod , and this is the first that could transmit ' strong ' enough for living in Boston . In fact , this unit is so strong , that you can broadcast over a station that has faint music , something I found the I-trip , the I-tunes , and a whole host of other units couldn't do . Remember though , it still won't be as good as CD quality . With the other units I tried , I could get the music to work for a while , but as soon as I drove just a little ways , I would have to find a ' cleaner ' ( more static ) station - even just a hint of reception would throw the music off .  
1	  I received the Etymotic 6is from Amazon today and was really excited to get them . I am using them with my Ipod Touch . But when compared with my Ipod earbuds .. they sound terrible . They only come with 2 earpieces ( the long flang type ( you better have a long ear canal ) and the foam type . Yes there are other tips you can get .. but you have to buy those " extra " . Plus I noticed that these need " filters " that cost $ 15 to replace ( what ? .. no thank you , if I paid this much it should last ) . I was expecting good sound and ok Bass given some of the complaints I saw on these reviews . What I got was painful ear buds , tin-like sound and no bass . It would be uncomfortable to wear these for more than 10 minutes since the triple flang tips are so long and go dangerously deep into your ears . When people say no bass and mids were missing , it is WORSE than apple earbuds which come with my ipod touch . Why pay to get worse sound ? Instructions said to wet the tips and twist into your ears to get Bass . I 'm sorry but if I have to do a " procedure " to get good sound , then these things are not worth it . Take my warning .. don't get these . Maybe there is a break in period , but if they don't sound and feel good right out of the box .. I 'm done . Keep your money and check out other earbuds out there . I hear that Ultimate ears 5 pros and Shures E4c are much better . I am going to try the UE 's and let you know .. soon .  
2	  Pros : Installation was easy , no jamming , always recovers itself after energy blackouts . Cons : Poor signal across concrete homes . In such conditions you may need to get a repeter .  
1	  Cheap cable that I bought as a spare , went to use it and one of the connectors is bad resulting in a lack of blue hues and an overall green tint . Jiggling the connector fixes the problem , but it never stays . Results may vary but I 'd suggest spending a little bit more on a different cable .  
2	  I bought this card in July and so far it works great . I use it in my " Olympus C-740 3MP Digital Camera w / 10x Optical Zoom . " Before I got the card , I took pictures only at 1024 x 768 , now I am able to take 181 pictures a time at 1600 x 1200 , and they print out better on paper .  
2	  Spent a lot of time researching these docks , i required one with am / fm and the ipod hook up . Pros : - Good Sound-Compact body design , will be easy to travel with-Every kind of snap in attachment to fit any ipod size , even Gen 5Cons : - only one , you can't change albums from the unit or the remote , you need to do so from the ipod directly . Not a problem if you have playlists already setup , but if youare like me and jump from artist / album to another , you have to be near the unit .  
2	  I bought this one after comparing the features from the reviews on Amazon . I have also used others but they dont compare to its performance as far as Noise reduction goes . I have held back one star as its not as good in sound as it is in Noise Cancellation . The around ear pads are very comfortable but you may want to give your ears some rest after 30 ro 35 mins maybe . Over all in my opinion its good for its value .  
2	  you can feel more secure carring your loved photo aquipment in this incredible backpack  
2	  The Simple Tech card worked from day 1 , and still works 4 months later . Probably have taken close to 1000 shots on this card cumulatively . The same cannot be said for two other Viking Cards , one 512 MB , one 256 MB . Both worked in the beginning , then days later generated corrupt image files . ( Go to Viking compact flash 512MB for my detailed review ) By the way , I own a G3 , and cannot tell meaningful difference in speed among Simple Tech , Viking , and the Lexar 12X I just received .  
1	  I order this heart rate monitor for my forerunner 301 . It appeared to be brand new out of the packaging and I am sure it was , however , it does not work . It could be a dead battery , who knows , the bottom line is that it should have worked . Now I have this useless piece of equipment . I would buy a battery for it but I can't because I am in Afghanistan . The CR2032 battery required is not sold out here .  
1	  Let me start by saying I 've been a WD fan for several years , and have had excellent luck with their internal drives . I suspect that the disk drives in My Books are fine also . My first My Book wouldn't even power on no matter what I did . This occurred after about 2 months . Today the Fire Wire interface on my second My Book quit working . Luckily the USB interface still works . 45 minutes with support trying to get my warranty straightened our didn't help my confidence level with this company . I agree that having a $ 320.00 hold put on a credit card for a $ 150 device is ridiculous . I bought this device to back up my data , but I no longer have faith that if I need them my files will be there .  
1	  These were a present for my son and he used them one day and they stopped working in the middle of listening to a song and we couldn't get them to work again . I was very disappointed . If I knew that they would match the price to the quality then I would have just went to the store and bought a cheap pair that would have lasted longer .  
2	  Got them on time and they work exactly as expected . Would order them again if I need more cables . :-)  
1	  I received this camera as a Christmas gift last year from my husband . We had a baby , so I 've spent the past year taking many pictures . I have only about 40 % that turned out decently . The others are blurry , dark , and lots of red eye . I 've tried every possible setting combination and I can't get consistently good pictures . My husband thought it was the way I was taking the pictures , so when he tried , he realized he got the same crappy results . Its a shame because he paid a lot of money for it and we trusted the Sony name , but this Christmas , on the advice of a world traveling friend , I 'm asking for a Canon ..  
1	  I enjoyed these while they lasted , but in less than a year the plastic deteriorated and the left ear cup fell off . They literally fell apart . They 're fine for light use , but if you travel a lot then I recommend you spend the money for a sturdier pair with a hard carrying case .  
2	  I search for a while for a decent pair of moderately priced headphones . I came to these and I am glad I did . The sound is great and they fit nicely . The only issue I have is that they don't fold flat and they have a lot of plastic that appears that it might break easy but just got them and no signs of yet of this being a problem . Also one suggestion to Sony and others . Make the cable changeable . What i mean is allo it to detach and include both a long cable and a short cable . This way you won't have a lot of excess cable when you only need a little . Overall very very please .  
1	  Can't say too much about the product itself - it was a gift and I haven't heard anything negative about it , so it may be decent . What irks me to no end is that two weeks later I got a call referencing my purchase of this product and then an " amazing offer " of some coupon books where they would charge my credit card $ 1 now , then a monthly fee until I unsubscribe . Every time I steered the conversation towards that charge , opting out , or not wanting to participate , the lady on the phone drove it back towards how great the offer was . It took several tries to get them to take " no " for an answer . If you purchase this item , be wary of where your information could end up . I don't know if it was the company directly , or if they sold it to a third party , but apparently they already had my credit card information on hand , which is a bit unsettling . I will be monitoring my credit card statement closely .  
1	  I got this device for a road trip from Boston , MA to Vermont and was able to observe its performance in a very populated spectrum in a big city , as well as in an area where there 's barely any radio recpetion . The TuneCase II just falls on its face . Despite having the cool feature ( you pay for it , of course ) of multiple FM frequencies you can use to tune to its broadcast , I was unable to find a clean frequency in Boston , despite spending about 30 minutes on scanning the range . There was always static , and worse , stations suddenly came on the radio and overrode the TuneCast 's transmission . In the backwoods of Vermont , the other shortcoming of the device appeared : no matter where you place the TuneCast , its signal was very weak , the sound was hissy with white noise and unless you turn the volume way up on your car stereo and mp3 player , you could barely hear the music come through . Trying all sorts of angles , holding it by hand , did nothing to help . I am going to look for a way to ' hardwire ' a connection to my car stereo . The TuneCast went back to the store .  
2	  This is not a replacement for all mice . I still use a full size cordless Logitech when I 'm at the office . However , for travel and other times it 's fine . Some points to note : 1 ) Range is affected by the screen and other RF shields . I encountered all the symptoms mentioned by other reviewers until I extended the USB cord to allow the receiver ' line of sight ' to the mouse . 2 ) I pull the batteries when not using it - I only travel once every 2 weeks so this is probably not as inconvenient as it sounds . 3 ) Overall feel , buttons etc . are fine considering what it is .  
2	  not much to be said , they 're a great value , CMPLE has really impressed me with their wire , and now these ! white barrels are easy to sharpie to whatever color you want , they 're cheap and the plastic doesnt like to crack . should last a long time . if you 're looking for RCA keystones , get these . I shopped around a long time on here , with free shipping these are the best deal at about $ 1,20 / per .  
2	  I have this for my home theater and it works great . positive switch with lockout on the knob so it 's solid . Only downside is having to get up and manually changing the switch when I want to use another device but worth the money .  
1	  Energizer should be ashamed to put their name on this useless piece of junk . I bought this laptop battery from Circuit City and 2 months later it could not hold a charge . When I attempted to contact Technuity or Batteries . com ( or whatever the fly-by-night company that produces this battery is called ) they informed me that I would have to ship the battery back to them in Indianapolis and include a check for $ 5.45 . When I questioned them about " FREE " replacement they just laughed . When I inquired about this business practice , they just told me to read the fine-print of the warranty . So , my recommendation is .. unless you enjoy damaging your laptop and spending money for a useless piece of plastic , stay away from this battery . Buy the Sony brand and pay the extra money .. atleast Sony will be more professional when responding to your concerns . Finally .. Note to Energizer - Cut these guys from your product line , you have already pushed me to only buy Duracell products from this day forward .  
1	  This pair worked great once I put the transmitter far away from my wireless internet . However , I then looked for a second receiver , and only then realized that Creative has stopped selling the transmitter / receiver combo , or the receiver by itself . Look for it on Creative 's website yourself if you don't believe me . There is another creative wireless receiver that Creative is selling , but it is not X-mod , so does not work with this transmitter . So if you only need one pair , and don't mind throwing the whole thing away if the one receiver breaks , then go for it . Otherwise , I suggest going with something that a manufacturer is still supporting . I am happy for Amazon 's return policy .  
1	  Wouldn't it be nice to know what eight types of media the device will handle ?  
2	  I am often hesitant to purchase 3rd-party parts for important equipment , wary of compatibility and reliability . But this battery performs well , holds a charge for a good long time . I will wait to see what it 's lifetime proves to be ..  
1	  This unit worked well but died after only 7 months of use . Avoid Panasonic equipment . It 's a waste of money .  
2	  No issues with this product , i am using it to send a signal to my basement , it is transmitting through 2 walls and the floor . Decent picture and sound very pleased with the product .  
1	  I tried to add this to my secured Netgear network without any luck . If you don't know how to " ping " your computer and change your " LAN settings " , watch out . I can't really blame the people who tried to help me with this problem . I think the combination of poor product information , non-user friendly technology and overseas phone response delays made this a terribly frustrating experience . I suppose if you have a laptop the set up might be easier .  
1	  I have had this unit for about a month . It looks great but it locks up , it turns it self on and off randomly . The unit has a lot of issues recording . When you set it up to record a show some times it records sometimes it does nothing . I am on my third unit now and this unit still has a lot of issues . There is no way to backup the unit so every time you do a hard rest you lose everything off the unit . When you record songs on the S50 there is no way to play them back on the PC . If you record a talk radio show there is no way to resume were you were last listening . Fast Forward and Reverse are very slow . To Fast Forward through 1 hour of audio it takes about 10 minutes . I can go on and on . Do not buy one of these .  
2	  I wanted a non expensive cable to hook up my Hp laptop and HDTV , so i took a chance and bought this chap cable . I can tell you that i made a great decision . Once it connected the screen on the television displayed my laptop screen . It was Crystal clear ! I would recommend this product to anyone . Don't go to best buy and buy the 40 dollar cable , its the same thing .  
1	  Not sure how many people who have vista got this thing to work ; but count one more who didn't . Pretty annoying such a simple piece of hardware can't work on a widely popular OS .  
2	  Got the item delivered and it wasn't operational . Sent it to Epson and they returned it in a timely manner with a new hard drive and mother board ( makes me wonder why I didn't get a new unit instead ) . The unit now is what I expected it to be and will be glad to have it on my international trip next year . I purchased it cause I didn't want to carry a laptop with me and wanted a storage device for my images . I will have to get a couple of extra batteries as the battery life is not as long as I would like . It operates easy enough and the images look great on the 4 " screen ( hope in the next couple of years DSLRs will have this size screen ) . It will be a welcome addition to my camera bag and should make my photo life a little bit easier . Thanks Epson =)  
2	  I bought two of these cameras for my kids . They are easy to use and have a variety of use options ( timer , video , still shots ) . My one critique is they burn through batteries fairly fast , so use rechargeable AA 's instead of disposable !  
1	  I would not rate this piece " good " . Still lot of distortions .. So guys go for something else ..  
2	  Set up was easy , instructions were helpful . Mounted on the dash since the windshield was too far to reach . Love the bluetooth capability that provides for hands-free phone operation with our existing cellphones . Came equipped with all needed accessories .  
2	  Bought this to take along on a Honda Goldwing . I only wanted something to play music with large capacity . I turn it on , set to shuffle play , stow it in the fairing pocket and ride . The only thing I don't care for is you have to load the software on your PC to get it recognized and to transfer my music to it . However it does find all the music already on my PC with no problems . My cheap little 1GB just appears as a drive that I can copy music too . With 30GB of music on board I can ride for weeks and not get bored with the music .  
2	  I use this in a place where I can't run an ethernet cable and have a weak WiFi signal because of multiple walls between my router and PC . Installation of the Powerline Ethernet Adapter was a snap - just plug one into the router and a plug , and the other ( which you have to buy separately - so you need 2 ) into a plug and your PC ethernet port , and you are good to go . Couldn't have been easier . Maximum throughput in my home ( built ~ 1985 ) was about 300 kbps .  
2	  After unsuccessful experiences with other lesser universal remotes , I was hesitant to give this a try . I 've only had it a few days , but so far I 'm very impressed . The setup was completely painless ; I connected the remote to my PC via USB , inserted the CD , and the software came up with no problems . It was able to identify all the devices in my setup , including such weird ones as the Roku IP music player , and the off-brand set-top box . Profiles for different activities were easy to set up too ; eg . when setting up DVD playback the software asked whether I wanted to control volume via the Stereo or DVD player . The biggest challenge with these things is that when they send commands , they have no way of knowing whether the commands were seen by the components , and so the remote can get out of ' sync ' . The unit lets you identify this situation and correct it , by walking through a series of menus . But if you keep the remote pointed in the right direction , this won't happen . The only downside of this unit is that it seems a bit fragile - I suspect if it gets dropped a few times , or sat on , it will be gone . So I 'll do my best to take care of it . Bottom line - go for it .  
2	  It was fast timing , great service , all went super , I would surely reorder from this vender , happy with overall order  
2	  This is a good quality printer with 2 major restrictions . First , the printer , printer paper & cartridge packs , and additional paper trays for labels and such are expensive . Second , the largest it prints is 4 " x6 " . SETTING UPA number of earlier reviewers commented on how difficult it was to print from the computer . Expect setup to take about an hour if everything goes right . Printing from the computer requires a USB printer cable , which doesn't come either with the printer or with Canon digital cameras . But if you dig through the stuff that came with your computer , you might find one . Otherwise you can either buy one or DirectPrint from your camera by connecting your camera to the printer with the same cable that connects your camera to your computer . The CD that comes with the printer is useless . The ZoomBrowser EX that 's on it is outdated , and the driver that allows your computer to interface with the printer isn't digitally signed . But all you have to do is go to Canon USA 's website , and look for the consumer support page and find the CP-200 . Canon provides current versions of ZoomBrowser and other software and drivers for whatever version of Windows or Mac OS you use . Download what you need , unzip the files you 've downloaded , then go to your computer 's Add A Printer and specify the location to which you unzipped the driver . Then the printer installs . Printing from Zoombrowser is extremely simple . You may not need directions , but if you do , Canon 's website has a pdf file which takes you screen by screen through printing . Some reviewers said borderless printing distorted their pictures , but the current version of ZoomBrowser crops photos instead of stretching them . If you don't want edges cropped , print with a border . Printing is fun to watch ; the colors go by layer by layer . Aparently the picture stands up to a lot once it 's dry , but I didn't test it . The supplies for this printer aren't cheap . Your drugstore and Ofoto print at about half the price . If you want to print entire albums , this may not be worthwhile . However , if you only need an occasional picture , it 's incredibly convenient not to have to go out , and the prints are very good . Then when you 're not printing , the printer can go in a drawer .  
2	  Lightweight , Easy Functions , Bass Ok , Reception Good , has been dropped on floor 3 times from 3 ft off of bed , 3rd time destroyed , internal parts fragile . Try not to drop but Good Radio .  
1	  I gave this item a try and while it could actually work as advertised-it really was unreliable . I followed all the instructions diligently and found it cumbersome to assemble . While I was able to feel secure leaving my compact notebook on it , I am not sure how after a couple of weeks of use it would hold up-long range durability didn't seem like a reasonable expectation . Great idea , but poor execution .  
1	  I bought it because it was priced well and had the HD upconvert feature . Recording was no problem - no issues there . My problems were with playback . The player began showing the alternate language subtitles on store-purchased movies . I could not turn OFF this feature - it had a mind of it 's own . The last straw was skipping from chapter to chapter - in random order , again on store-purchased movies . This piece of junk now resides on the garbage , where it belongs !  
1	  Should have taking the warning from another review more seriously . Single din deck wont even fit inside of this without trimming the plastic ( Tried 2 separate decks ) . Had a buddy come over that does this for a living and he told me this wasn't going to work . Throwing this piece of junk in the garbage and picking up a Metra .  
1	  The item wasnt made well and it broke . I wasnt very happy with the item . I also realized that the products from eforcity arent the best quality .  
1	  Right out of the box , the factory mouse would not work , no matter what I did . So , I tried a Microsoft Intelimouse ; that didn't work either . Then , I tried a Logitec cordless mouse , which worked ! I then attempted a drive image of the C drive . I tried to use Memorex CD-RW media , but that didn't work . I then tried CompUSA CD-RW media of the same specifications , and that did work . I hate to think where I would be if I hadn't tried these fixes . This is not inspiring for a brand new computer . My only consolation is that the computer was dirt cheap for what appears to be good features . Nothing else appears to be wrong with it , so far . If you buy it , I hope you have better luck than I did .  
2	  I have to admit that I was very skeptical about getting a Logitech Harmony remote . I have a Universal Remote that has worked well for me . It supports macros as well but after my brother sat me down and discussed the real merits of the " Activities " - based Harmony , I began to appreciate the differences . 1 . Sleek design both looks great and feels great . Some folks may find a few of the buttons a little difficult to see but if you 're like me , you end up using the same set of buttons over and over again so finding and using them becomes habit . 2 . My old remote doesn't keep track of power on / power off of devices . So when I ran a macro on the old remote , I either needed to eliminate all power on / off commands or deal with the possibility of toggling the power off when I really wanted it on , etc . The Harmony " remembers " what the current power states of my devices are so when I click the Watch TiVo activity after I 've been watching TV , my TV doesn't suddenly go off . 3 . Forget about mentally mapping device inputs to buttons , etc . The Harmony embeds all the input selections in the Activities . I had to " un-learn " my former way of using a remote . For example , if I wanted to watch a movie , I 'd have to do a bunch of individual steps like set the remote for the amplifier , turn the amp on , set the amp input to DVD , set the remote to TV mode , turn the TV on , put the TV input on A / V 3 , etc . With the Harmony , I press " Watch Movie " and the remote sends out a series of commands that I 've already set up with the Harmony software and downloaded to the remote . The single button press replaces all the button pressing I used to do on the old remote . Sure , setting up macros on my old remote would have done the same thing too , but like I mentioned above , keeping track of which devices were powered on , etc . was a thorn in my side with macro use . 4 . I was a hold out on wanting to use the internet to program my remote but after using Logitech 's large online database , it was easy to lookup the names of devices I wanted to control without having to punch in and try awkward 3 or 4 digit device codes with little to no user feedback . Whats more , I can tweak the performance of the remote by changing delay times , etc to make it more responsive . 5 . Self-charging caddy solves two problems at once , namely , where should I ( more importantly , where should MY KIDS ) put the remote when it isn't being used ? Also , how can we minimize feeding batteries to this thing ? The caddy takes care of the where and how . 6 . Cool gadget-lover features . Hey , I 'm a nerd . I like creating little customized bitmaps that I can download as backdrops or slideshows for my remote . Does it add anything to meet the remote 's primary functional requirements ? No . Is it fun for a nerd like me to use and surprise others with ? YES ! All-in-all , I 'm a convert and I recommend the Logitech Harmony 880 . I also have the 520 which isn't as slick looking as the 880 but pretty much does all of the same things . You do have to have some level of computer know-how to set the remote up successfully but there 's plenty of help available for the novice . Enjoy !  
2	  I purchased this amp to use in the bi-amped mode for my center channel speaker . The level control allows for fine tuning of the volume level . One slight thing to note was the ambiguous listing for the bridged mono power output : According to the owners manual in different spots it is either 150 or 160 watts . The box says it 135 watts bridged . No matter , it 's way more than enough power for my needs and an excellent value for the price . I now have two of these AudioSource amps-one for almost three years-and have had no problems .  
1	  Not only is the idea of having a DVD player and VCR bundled in one neat package space-saving , but it should also be money-saving . For the price of this Samsung DVD / VCR combo , though , you can buy a Samsung VCR and a DVD player seperately that are of higher quality . The Samsung VR8160 4 Head Hi-Fi VCR is praised by reviewers for its ease-of-use and great picture quality , while the VCR in this pack is considered simply subpar by most . Along with that , you can get the Samsung DVD-N501 Nuon DVD / HDCD Player , which is not only better than the faulty ( understatement ) DVD player in this package , but most other DVD players as well . It plays DVD 's , CD 's , MP3 's , Nuon games , and has many more features . Walk away from this ' deal ' and all other current VCR / DVD combos , because all you 'll find are lower quality products for higher prices . See for yourself .  
1	  Unfortunately this item tries to do too many things and that is its downfall . The laser is not bright enough and drains the 2xAA batteries ( would'nt last more than a day 's meeting ) . The wireless mouse is difficult to control and will not replace a regular mouse - the only good feature is the powerpoint control for slide advancement and reversal - works great for that with the two neatly placed buttons . However , if you happen to touch the large central menu button ( hard to avoid because of its size and central location ) it reverses to " mouse mode " - the two buttons turn to right and left mouse buttons - result the slides will not then advance - if this happens during your presentation - takes some figuring out ! THe poor battery life , weak laser and large and wrongly placed menu button make this an undesirable item - coupled with the fact that my first one blew out its circuit after 8 months ( 4 weeks for replacement and UPS costs ) makes it an unrecommendable item .  
1	  This GPS does not have a USB cord . It is totally obsolete and can not work with anything but an old PC . I would give it half a star if I could .  
1	  I bought one and have regretted that purchase over and over . IMHO the Pentax Optio W30 sucks big time . I sent the first camera back for repair because of the loud clicking sound the camera made while trying to focus in movie mode . It made so much noise that it would drown out any audio you were recording at the time . I asked if this was a problem they had heard of before and the tech on the phone said " No , you will have to send the camera back so we can check it out " . Spent $ 34.17 sending the camera back overnight shipping because I was heading for the Grand Canyon in about 2 weeks and I bought this camera specifically for the trip . I found out later that this is a problem that goes back to the W10 , continued through the W20 and is still a problem with the W30 . A different tech I talked to later said " That was supposed to be fixed with the W30 " . They WILL lie to you . They will not reimburse you for shipping even though the problem is with their camera design . None of the techs would let me talk to a supervisor or anybody else in their food chain . There were many other issues I had trying to get the camera shipped back before I left on vacation . Made a bunch of phone calls and sent a bunch of emails trying to get my questions answered . Pentax has the worst customer service I have ever encountered in my life - period . The camera ingested a large amount of water about halfway down the Grand Canyon run and quit working altogether thereby depriving me of the pictures I would have taken had I bought another camera . After leaving the Grand Canyon , I was heading to northern Colorado to do some paddling so I called Pentax and told them that I was on the way to their headquarters in Golden and I wanted my money back . They could keep this water filled hunk of junk and use it for a fish sinker . I called them again while I was in their parking lot to let them know that I was there . I sat in their reception area for nearly an hour before anybody , besides the receptionist , would talk to me . I thought about getting arrested while I was there , then decided against it . Finally , two guys came out with a new W30 and after a half hour of talking I finally figured out that there was no way I was ever going to get my money out of these jerks - so - like a moron I took the new camera . It has the same problem as the first camera with the video . As to the ability to see the screen , nothing you can do will make it were you can see the screen in bright sunlight . You will be reduced to pointing the camera in the general direction of what you want to photograph and pushing the shutter button . If you own a Pentax , I wish you the best of luck . If you don't , I would recommend that you keep it that way . I don't like the camera and I really don't like the people that work for Pentax . There is a lot more to the story but I don't need to sit here and type up another couple of pages , just let me reemphasize - the worst customer service I have ever encountered . As a matter of fact - I think I 'll take another stab at getting my money back today . I 'll let you know how it works out . As it turns out - the second W30 was as big a hunk-O-junk as the first one . After three months of trying I finally got my money back from Pentax . Lousy camera and a lousy company to do business with . One more time ; The worst customer service I have ever encountered in my life and that 's saying something .  
2	  This product works well , and sounds good . I compared it to the Coby CA-747 , and Griffin DirectDeck ( 7256-DDECK ) . Both of those had * awful * sound quality . The philips adapter sounds good , about as good as one can expect going through the cassette head of the stereo system .  
1	  I spent a few hours using these adhesive squares to run a 100 ' + cat5 cable and I must admit I was extremely pleased when I was done , It turned out great . Then the next day , 3-4 squares fell off the wall .. no biggie .. I replaced them with new ones . Then the next day , I did the same thing . A week later half my cable is on the wall , the other half has fallen to the floor . 17/48 of my squares have now fallen . Very disappointed , however , it was a low risk investment . I 'll try a different vendor and cannot recommend this product if you are sticking it to a wall or the door frame .  
2	  Living in an Amazon dist . city ( Phoenix ) shipping is really fast . I can order something on one day and it will be at my house the next day . I 've even had Amazon deliver something with what appeared somebody 's personal car , on a Sat . This router setup was extemely easy ( using WPA2 ) and the range is great , full coverage on a 2500 sq / ft house . So far no problems at all , it should be noted that it is powered by an APS UPS system , so it 's always powered on with filtered / AC / battery backup .  
2	  This is the 7th trackball purchased by my family and work . The first one my wife purchased for work . Then we purchased one for our desktop which we lost in Hurricane Katrina . Now we have one for each of the 3 laptops at home and we just purchased 2 for work . If you have never experienced a trackball , once you get it , you will never want a mouse or mouse pad again . Recommend a trackball over any mouse period !  
2	  this is a great deal and shipping was fast ! I use it in my Zen mp3 player ; works good .  
1	  FOLLOW UP : One of the two fans on this unit has already started to vibrate and make much noise . I ended up removing this from the hard drive , cut the Molex connector off for reuse and threw the rest in the trash where it belongs . Try to find a competitive product with ball bearing fans , I wouldn't buy this product again . I tried one of these Vantec fan units on a Dell Dimension 4700 desktop . I received the computer for free as it was no longer booting , turned out the hard drive controller was going bad and there was many bad sectors on the drive . I ended up replacing the hard drive and found that the new hard drive was running as high as 127 degrees Fahrenheit ( 52 degrees Celsius ) . I installed the Vantec cooler to the hard drive but used a 3M brand double-sided tape to attach to the drive . I realized a 3-4 degree drop in temperature at idle ( just disk spinning ) and almost nothing under a heavy read / write load . The Vantec heat sink does absorb some heat and the two 50 MM fans move heat from the drive , the problem is case design . I ended up buying a 140 MM fan and cutting the removable panel out on the case and mounting that with a dust filter . I am now getting no higher than 109 degrees at full read / write load . I find that if the case air circulation is already limited , the Vantec won't help too much . The Vantec unit will just move the heat away from the drive and recirculate it back inside the case if auxiliary case cooling is not used . I would recommend finding a fan with ball bearings instead of sleeve bearings , once sleeves start to wear they go bad pretty fast . This Vantec cooler may work fine in a well ventilated ( well designed ) case , just didn't do the trick on mine without the modifications stated above . Hope this helps .  
1	  Appears to be a very bright , focused monitor . Text is very clear . No problem tuning it in . Only one problem , a 1 1/2 " vertical stripe down the middle of the screen . Called Gvision tech support and they said to return the monitor , but they had a curious question . The tech asked if it was a black monitor . From that I gather there may be problems with the black ones . Also , the one I received was manufactured in Dec . 2002 . That makes it nearly two years old already . If it hadn't been defective it could have easily gotten 4 stars maybe five . Didn't try the speakers .  
1	  There was a picture of one a little further down the page and a special price if the second one was bought . I was not happy with the second one that I got . The picture of the first one was showed as the same for the second but in fact was not . I bought on the idea that the second one would be the same as the first but it was not and I did not like the second one and probably will not use it or order anything again from Amazon because of this fact . The picture shown here is the one I liked but not like the second one .  
1	  DO NOT purchase this product if shoplet . com is the supplier . They ship out in the thin box intended for store display and you will receive a damaged product . Sure , you 'll call and they 'll give you an RA for return , but will never schedule the UPS pickup , so in frustration you end up paying to ship it back to them . Then they will refuse to receive the return because , get this , the package is damaged when it arrives at their site . The parts of this riser that weren't damaged appeared to be nice . The riser is adjustable so you can determine where you want it . Too bad the damage to mine was so visible , otherwise I might have kept it .  
2	  Quality filters really make a huge difference . I was using a cheapo filter before I bought this one . Before I even put this filter on my canon 7d , I could feel the difference in quality right away . This polarizer filter is definitely not made from cheap materials . I will definitely buy a B & W product again . Save up because this filter is worth the price . I 'll be posting photos of before and afters soon .  
1	  I have tried this kit on numerous cd and dvd discs and not once has it managed to repair any of them ( the scratches weren't even deep , they were barely visible ) . If I 'd tried rubbing the discs with washing up liquid using very cheap toilet paper I might have had more luck .  
2	  I purchased this product after agoning over the decision made more difficult by the reviews good and bad . What sold me on this product was the fact that a rep or tech from the vendor replied to every comment made about the product . Whether offering help or advice it told me they were passionate about thier product and opinions of said product . None of the other big vendors did anything of the sort . Indicated to me they stood behind the product and had in-depth knowledge of it . Probably a small company which means even more when they can provide feedback but the big names cannot devote anyone to the same percieved level of service . I got the product on time and I followed the instructions to a tee . Worked beautifully with my gear . Have a 46 inch RCA LCD HD TV and Mediacomm Cable box , I am told it is manufactured by a co . called ASPEN and therefore no incompatabilities were listed on hotlinks website with this cable box . Works like a charm . My eqipment is in a closet just behind the wall where the TV mounts , drilled throught the wall with grommets and into the coat closet , cables were plenty long enough . I do not have any latency like described in some posts . Don't need to be a sys engineer to get this to work , just need to be able to read . Hid the IR sensor behind the TV as directed where it is not flooded with light or inteference from the room or TV itself .. I cannot get it to fail any time of day . Very happy with this purchase and if I had another use for another I would buy one . One post stated it seemed cheaply put together , I did not think so , although it did not have embossments or logos all over it it looked and felt pretty solid to me . Another said the emitters came of the ribbon , mine are solidly attached . Anothe said the ribbon split wrong revealing bare wire , I carefully seperated mine with no issues . I would recommend they make the box so it could be wall mounted with the oblong keyhole so it could hang on a screw but other than that .. I liked the ribbon style cable for the emitters that could be split and routed as needed , Sticky stuff worked just fine if you find the eye first and don't have to remove it . Can you really expect it to stick if you remove it half a dozen time before you find the IR reciever on your remote equip because you did not read the instructons first . It clearly explain how to find the IR reciever on your equip whcih you stick the emitter on to . Now hopefully it just lasts . I think I recall another post saying it got hot , I have not noticed this and frankly don't recall feeling for it but have touched it since it has been on and no heat issues jump out at me . I wasn't alarmed when picking it up I think I can say it did not get hot to the touch . For a wired product it works awesome . So hopefully this may help you decide and come to a less agonizing decision that I had to make .  
1	  The unit skipped ( screeching sounds ) with brand new mp3 's disks from day one . I had the unit serviced and the problem still remains . The problem is not the disks , but the unit since the cds work fine on my other player . Unlike every other boombox I have owned , the AC adaptor is on the plug and is enormous . The sound is only marginal . ..  
1	  The set I bought was comfortable , produced a nice sound , and passively blocked noise well . ( Here it comes . ) BUUTT these headphones popped and crackled constantly with the two heavy bass test tracks I tried on them . If you 're not going to use them with that kind of audio ( super heavy bass ) then they 'll work fine for you . With that kind of restriction though , they just aren't worth the price .  
2	  So you want to know how a Visor differs from a Palm ? The short answer is not too much , but enough to make the Visor Deluxe a better purchase than the Palm IIxe ( 3Com 's competing unit ) . The major differentiators are the following : 1 ) The Visor 's form factor is a touch more ergonomic , I feel . 2 ) The Visor comes preloaded ( in ROM ) with a niftier address book application . 3 ) The Visor 's OS ( although the same as the current Palm , I believe ) is non-upgradable . 4 ) The Visor comes equiped with the " Springboard " expansion slot which allows for the addition of everything from modems to GPS units to MP3 players with little to no change in form factor ( the Palm , on the other hand , generally expands via larger units that snap on the back and connect to the cradle contact ) . I 've been incredibly satisfied with the performance and durability of my Visor having upgraded from an old Palm Personal . Either way you go , these handhelds are potentially the most useful thing you can spend $ on .  
2	  The SD1000 doesn't disappoint . This camera is an overachiever . After picking up this camera for myself I loved it so much I gave one to my mother-in-law as a Christmas gift . It 's an incredible precison device , the pictures are excellent , the video is stellar , it also has a recording feature so the camera can double as an audio recorder . Other ultracompacts with this cameras ' feature set cost quite a bit more . This camera is loaded with features which give you the ability to capture some magnificent shots . I was so impressed with this camera I when out and purchased my first DSLR.I carry this camera everywhere I go . I never miss an opportunity for a great photo . I highly recommend this camera . If you purchase it you 're love it .  
1	  Only thing I like about this filter is that , I got it with my Nikon 50mm lens for free . It is unusable in conditions where there is light in-front or towards the sides causing horrible reflections on my images . I am glad I did not spend $ 9.99 to buy this filter .  
1	  I ordered a Mini-iPod from Amazon back on April 30 , 2004 . The original ship date was June 1 , 2004 . Amazon has delayed shipping me the product 3 times now , and my latest scheduled ship date is September 2 , 2004 . My recommendation to you is go somewhere else to get the product !  
1	  Using this product when it was brand new , i found that it 's useless . It can't even shave hairs on my front , let alone my back . The device just painfully pulls on your hairs without great difficulity cutting it . With desperation , i grinded the device back and forth on a hair patches to finilly get a cut ( as my hairs got painfully pulled ) . I used the device properly as described by the instructions , & no hairs were stuck in the device , as some other ( bias ? ) reviewer mentioned could happen . I eventually gave up , & got another shaver . USELESS ! I lost the reciept , so tried to give it away for free to my friend , but he didn't want it . lol I can't even give that thing away if i try , but i don't have the heart to throw it out . ( i hate waste ) . lol This company isn't good at making shavers apparently , as i recomend you stick to the brands that have more experienc in this area . I 'm experienced with such products , as I 've been buying electric shavers of various companies since a teenager ( im 30yo now ) , & i 've never seen a shaver so crappy .  
1	  Buyer 's beware . Olympus support is horrible . If you ever lose or damage your software Olympus will not help you get it . I lost my CD when I moved and you can't download the software anywhere ( you can't even buy it from Olympus ) . Now I have a completely worthless digital recorder . I 'LL NEVER BUY OLYMPUS AGAIN .  
1	  This worked fine for about 5 months , now it shorts out , so music comes through only one earbud ( regardless of which of the 2 splitter inputs is used ) . Squeezing / bending the splitter fixes the 2nd channel , but only while holding it in that position . Usually had in my shorts pocket , so not a lot of stress on the cable . Due to this problem , I would not buy this product again .  
2	  We 're really happy with this Sony after buying & returning TEAC W-600R Dual Full-Logic Cassette . What a difference in sound ! Better features , too . Definitely worth the difference in price .  
2	  This case is a great , simple pouch for Sirius Universal port receivers . I own the Sportster 5 and it fits snugly into the single-pouch case . The seems are stitched well and seem sturdy . The inside lining is soft enough so that it doesn't scratch the screen of your receiver . The case is also stiff enough to help protect your receiver in case you place it inside luggage or a larger carrying case . THERE IS NO SEPARATE COMPARTMENT FOR THE REMOTE . In fact , I cannot see the remote fitting in with a Sportster 4 or 5 , only with a slimmer model like the Starmate . Overall , great product for the price . As long as it protects my receiver from the house to the car to the office , I am ecstatic !  
2	  This cable is good for anyone who needs a new cat 5 cable . If you are a online gamer is cat 5 cable is great for you and anyone .  
2	  This is actually the 4th time I 've used this stuff . The first 2 times were for a pair of STK392-560 convergence IC 's for a Sony rear projection TV . They keep the chips about 5C cooler than with the other thermal compound ( measured with an infrared thermometer ) . Third use was for making a portable N64 . Used it on the CPU , GPU , and RAM chips and they stay nice and cool . And my most recent use was for my computer CPU . This , along side the Cooler Master 92 Hyper TX3 , keep my CPU A LOT cooler than the original equipment . If you are doing anything that requires thermal compound , then always get this stuff . Don't even bother looking at anything else , because EVERYTHING else is inferior to this .  
2	  I bought the body with USM 28-105 lens four months ago and I loved it so much . You can use many functions to take beautiful pictures . On some point , it 's better than the Canon EOS 50 . But I must remind you : the 28-90 lens is not good and professional . So my suggestion is : just buy the body . A good lens is very important .  
2	  I spent A LOT of time trying to find a reasonably priced tripod that had true fluid-head smooth panning and tilting . I have my own videography business , and had spent $ 100 on a tripod that was jerky when you tried to pan or tilt . This velbon cost $ 60 and is incredibly smooth for pan and tilt . The tripod is a little bit too light weight . i wish it was a bit sturdier . but other than that , excellent tripod for the price . To get a significantly better tripod , you 'd have to pay at least $ 180 . update : 8.1.07after having used this tripod for close to a year , it no longer performs well . the camera sits crooked on the head now and the tripod is useless .  
2	  Hello , I have Zune 30GB over a month and so far I am very happy about it . Solid case , good sound .. nevertheless I was very surprised when I started organized my music files - simply there is probably some bad routine in software , because it does not organize my files in the order I want . I spoke to my friends and they reported similar problem . If anybody knows how to fix it ..  
1	  I ' , dying of spinal cord degeneration due to radiation responses in Hiroshima during Occupation . I 've had IBM 's , then compatibles since 1981 . We had a divergence in programming ever since ; MS believes in overgrowth , inelegance , and bugs . We used to work with 16KB and do fine . MS also has other tactics and this was one - when I woke up paralyzed in the right-hand , it was , what to do ? I could not get the competing hardware / software package since it was incompatible with WIN 7 ( as are half my devices and programs ) , so I was stuck with Win7 's not very grand speech recognition program and this set of headphones wit mike . The mike does not isolate sounds . It 's all or nothing ; tower of babel . So I type a finger at a time using my good hand .  
1	  It was meant for a 6-person real estate management office . We repacked and returned it within one week . The set up and config were easy . The printer 's control panel prompted for user action EVERY time non-letter-sized media was detected . It worked fine for single copy jobs but continuously jammed up for multi-page copies causing the toner wastefully smeared over hands and paper when unjamming . Canon brand toner cartridge at around $ 140 a piece would need replacement frequently .  
1	  I have a 2003 Kia Spectra and it does not work and also the USB ports don't fit well . Definitely returning .  
1	  I returned this product twice ; once for a replacement and the second time for a refund . My research pointed to this camera as being able to meet my needs , however it did not . One was a feature oriented problem , in that it took way too long to cycle between photos . I missed some really good memories at my son 's high school graduation because of that . More importantly , both cameras had lens problems that manifested in opaque circles showing up in photos that had a solid background . Sorry , but this camera just did not make the grade . I ended up with a Canon .  
2	  These HDMI cables are every bit as good as the ones going for $ 30-$35 . Don't let their low price fool or throw you . I compared the quality of the feed / signal going between my DirecTV HD box and Magnavox HD TV and they are the same . Well worth the price even with S / H.  
1	  UPDATE 6/24/12 - So I email the seller . Of course he goes : - Dear Aya , Thanks for writing an email to MarginMart . As I can see that you have placed this order with Fulfillment By Amazon so this order was fulfilled / shipped to you by Amazon itself . Now we request you to kindly contact Amazon Customer Support for more info . You can reach them at 866-216-1072Please let us know if you have any other question . ThanksSergio-This " Sergio " obviously doesn't care and blames it on Amazon . I know Amazon packs and ships products , but I believe it is products that are READY for shipping , etc . This particular item had a bag that SAID " DVI-D TO HDMI CABLE 6 FEET " where it clearly had a DVI-I cable , which is totally useless . I then try Amazon 's automated return service , where it required me to actually talk to a representative . I told them them the story through chat and the person just gave me a refund and told me don't even bother sending it back . At least Amazon made it simple and easy enough . But I still wouldn't buy from the sellers again . * For crying out loud , there has been a negative feedback , where about 300 people at least read it and yet they don't learn ! STAY AWAY FROM THIS SELLER . Not worth your time or your hard earned cash if they keep failing their customers . Sent them an email . I will update to see how the conclusion .  
1	  I got this player 2 months ago . It worked fine , it takes some time to get used to using it , but once I did , it was great . HOWEVER , I was using it while walking to class , and the screen just shattered . I did nothing out of the ordinary , it just shattered . The glass is all gone and the screen itself is half-black from it . I e-mailed them AND called them , and I was told from both places that the screen is not covered under warranty ( seems as if almost nothing truly is ) . I even asked them if I could pay to have it repaired , and they said no , tough luck . Anyway , I 'm pretty pissed off right now . I wasted 200 bucks on a decent player , but the warranty makes it not worth [ .. ] . As much as I truly hate to say it , I may buy an ipod next .. atleast they know how to keep a happy customer . I will never buy another iRiver product EVER again .  
2	  These bookshelf speakers have good range and solid bass response .. not muddy or thin like a lot of speakers in this size and price range . I think these compare very favorably to my more expensive KEF IQ10 bookshelf speakers and have a bit more bass .  
1	  I bought this router because a friend and the Best Buy computer guru suggested it . You better know exactly what you are doing because tech support is on Mars ! I think I am going to have to reach them by telepathy . I may be taking this back in 2 days if I can't get it up and going by then . I use Netscape , not Internet Explorer . I don't know if that is making a difference . However , I am feeling very hostile to Netgear right now .  
2	  this system is perfect if you like loud base and want alot of power out of your speakers . But these speakers aren't as clear as it i thought it would be from reading the reviews . i had a BOSE Companion 2 and i think those speakers sounds better than these , but they do lack base and loudness . but overall i am pretty satisfied with these ..  
2	  I just wanted to let you know how happy I was when I found your website through Copernic . I previously bought a JVC Digital Video Camera and their website was so unhelpful and so empty in information . I returned the camera and bought the Olympus D-340R and I am sure I 'll keep it just from viewing your site and the reviews and how easy it is to locate the accessories and so fourth .. thank you  
2	  This filter protects my objective on the Canon EF-S 18-55 mm IS II zoom lens . I have used Tiffen products for over 50 years .  
2	  This is easy to use and allows my to remotely use my camera . Love it ! It did not come with a manual so be sure to have your camera manual handy when getting ready to use this for the first time .  
1	  Warning - I bought this product after a great experience with the smaller frame but I have had two big problems . ( 1 ) - a product problem = It would not accept photo transfers from my Mac laptop as the mac laptop disconnected the USB connection saying it was drawing excessive power ( I have never had this problem before and it happened twice ) - note that there are quite a lot of posts on the smaller Phillips frame reporting extensive problems with macs both at the operating system , hardware and photosoftware level ( 2 ) - an instructions plus user problem it turns out it seemed not to take the memory chip used by either my Sony or HP digital cameras which are reasonably popular makes but the slot looks to a reasonably sensible consumer as if it is the right one ( and the paper instructions are misleading ) so I jammed the slot which lost me my chip and incapacitated the slot ! Be warned . So I would be ( very ) wary if you are a Mac user or if you assume that a popular camera memory chip will work with this without very carefully checking . A disappointment considering how much I liked the smaller frame , which I loaded direct from camera .  
1	  I got this camera today after ordering it from Circuit City and I will now be driving 2 hours to take it back to Circuit City ! It will not install . I emailed Creative earlier , but haven't heard back from them . I read another review that said it would not work with Media Center , so maybe that 's my problem ; I have Media Center 2005 ! Creative should really tell people which systems do and don't work ! I have spent several hours trying to get this STUPID CAM installed ! It 's going back to the store ! I will buy another Logitech !  
2	  There are a few of us who like to use old technology for its own sake . Maybe its the challenge of ' massaging ' old technology to try to get state of the art results out of obsolete equipment , maybe it is nostalgia for some . For me , it was a combination of wanting to save a few bucks while getting the best possible image quality . Several years ago I bought a very-used KodaK / Nikon DCS330 digital camera to wrap around several IX-Nikkor APS lenses I own . My how things have changed since this camera first appeared in 1997 ! The size is large , very large , even though the camera body Kodak used as a base is the ' smaller ' Nikon Pronea 6i , which was an APS ( remember that failed format ? ) unit . And it is very power-hungry : I eats 6 AA batteries so quickly ( and so expensively ) that the only practical solution is an external battery pack , in my case a used Quantum Battery 2 , now discontinued , with a coiled cord tethering the two together . Why bother with all this stuff when you can get a small , faster , more-megapixelated camera ? In short , Image quality . The color rendition , depth , saturation , and sharpness of the images taken with this camera are simply outstanding . I 'm more than willing to put up with its 3.0 megapixel resolution to get what I consider to be the finest quality digital picture I 've ever seen . Its hard to explain , but the picture is ' warm , ' unlike the super-accurate and to my eyes cold rendering of most digital cameras . The DCS330 is more like film in warmness , albeit the intrusive graininess . But there are drawbacks . Size and weight of all this stuff is one , having to use an external power supply on your belt is another , and its need for this item being reviewed , a ' hot mirror , ' is a third . A hot mirror is a special filter needed in early digital cameras to block infrared light from reaching the CCD sensor . Today , this technology is either built-in or isn't needed because of technological improvements , I 'm not sure which . But the old digitals need this filter , or the image will have a reddish cast to it . The Kodak DCS330 had one built-in in front of the mirror inside the body , but it had to be removed to use IX-Nikkor APS lenses for which the Nikon body was originally designed , otherwise the lens , with its extra-deep seating within the camera body , would break the built-in hot mirror . Kodak said you can't use the IX-Nikkors ; yes you can , but the internal hot mirror must first be removed and replaced with a lens-mounted version like this Tiffen . And that 's all there is to tell . You need one of these if you are considering an older professional-grade Kodak digital with IX-Nikkor lenses , or if for any reason there is a need to replace the built-in hot mirror with a conventional lens-mounted hot mirror filter . Unless you like red-toned pictures , that is . The Tiffen does a great job , is of good quality . This part is pricey , but that may reflect the lowered demand and consequent higher cost per unit to produce . For people like me who simply enjoy playing with old , technologically-obsolete weirdo camera equipment , Tiffen 's continuing production of this and similar filters for obsolete technology is a godsend .  
1	  I bought one of these at .. for my wife 's birthday . I am revulsing in shame at the poor design of the user interface of this unit . Numero uno . The player doesn't save your place when you turn it off . OK . A lot of them don't , but I 'm not anywhere close to finished . Numero dos . You can't browse through directories ( albums ) on an MP3 disk , only songs ( all 200 of them , right ? ) . To locate a particular album , you had better already know the names of all the folders on the disk . You have to do an alphabetical search to get to it . One workaround I can think of is to prefix numbers to the folders prior to burning the MP3 disk . This requires more computer skill than should be required for a device that costs sixty bucks . Numero tres . OK , let 's assume you know the names of all the albums on your MP3 disk , or that you implemented the workaround I just described . You 're playing the disk and you want to switch to a different album . You do the search . You get .. NOTHING ! Why ? Because you have to back all the way out of the directory structure to get to the album information . This involves STOPPING the player altogether , and whatever else you were doing ( like driving ) , THEN do the search . In short , one would expect an MP3 player that includes a car kit to be reasonably user-friendly enough to be used while driving a car . Memory would be nice . A quantity equivalent to an .. alarm clock would suffice . That way , you could leave the thing in your car and NEVER have to touch it again . I would have EASILY traded the four-line scrolling display of the names of the songs , the artists , the running time , and on and on - nice frosting , but not enough cake - for about ten minutes ' worth of thought about how these items are used . The MP3 format has soo much potential , and too many of these gadgets fail to come anywhere close to meeting this potential . The engineers ( or trained monkeys ) who designed this thing need to be sent back to school - on the short bus .  
2	  I was a bit skeptical about this product due to some early reviews that were negative , but I 've had a great experience . It offers a very rich set of functions , and has definitely reduced " suspicious activity " I had been experiencing with my prior router ( an old Linksys Etherfast DSL Router ) . I 've had to reset it only once in the three months I 've had it . I have not tried its VPN support . I 'm very pleased with this product .  
2	  I bought these despite the negative reviews : Facts : 1 . They 're cheap2 . They 're an alternative for those of us who don't want to use bluetooth headsets . 3 . They can be used to listen to music from the phone in stereo . 4 . The sound quality is fine . People can hear me better when I use these as opposed to talking into the phone itself . I got everything I wanted ; a hands free alternative so I can drive that works and is cheap . Yes , the cords are long but they can be tied if you can take 5 mins to do so . And yes , the ear buds are a bit big but they still work for me .  
1	  I have owned a dozen HP printers over the years and just bought a 460wf . The printer has been nothing but trouble . I am fairly computer literate and was unable to connect to the computer wirelessly following the basic instructions . After 6 hours with " customer service " I was able to get it set up and working . The tech support people ( the 6th group I spoke to ) said it was " faulty drivers " . 5 weeks later the problem returned . When I called to get a product return number I was told that it was too late to return the item . I then called customer service who told me that the warranty had expired ( false ) . The offshore customer support techs were basically automons who could not speak English . Unless your time has no value this customer support is WORTHLESS . This is the worst printer I have ever had ( not that it prints ) and the customer support is so bad I will NEVER buy HP again . Do yourself a favor and buy any other printer .  
1	  Hardware is great . A wonderful little device . The software is next to useless . It simply does not work , and their technical support has not EVER respond to my attempts to contact them . A shame , but unless they actually make software that works , I would have to say avoid buying from them . I have not been able to update the music on the internal memory for months due to the freezing , crashing and very low quality of their code .  
2	  Works perfectly for my 2000 Jeep Wrangler Sport ( TJ ) . Came with everything I needed and seemed good quality . Very easy to install , lots of options and sturdy .  
2	  I very rarely write reviews about products I buy , but these headphones are so amazing , I decided I had to . The headphones themselves are obviously high-quality , they 're comfortable , and my ears do not get sore when I wear them for extended periods . Their sound is broad , I can hear the highest notes to the lowest notes , and every mid-tone in between . Their range is unbelievable , and I don't have to have the music up to hear everything , like I do with other inferior headphones . These headphones are literally a steal , the company could get away with selling them for 3 to 4 times what they are selling them at now . I would gladly buy these headphones again . They were shipped quickly , and I couldn't be happier .  
1	  I own this camera . Nowhere does Sony tell you that this camera will only function reliably with sony discs . The manual only tells you it has to be an 8cm disc . When you turn the camera on ( after you buy it ) it will show " sony disc reccomended " on the screen , not required . After losing discs to access error messages ( this included my daughters sweet 16 party , an overseas trip and finally a vacation in the mountains ) I sent it in to sony . Sony sent it back stating nothing was wrong , but that sony discs had to be used to guarantee it will work ( stated nowhere on the box or manual ) . The sony discs are hard to find and more expensive than any other brand . Sony forces you to buy their discs after you 've bought the camera otherwise why not clearly state Sony Discs Mandatory on the box or handbook prior to purchase . They are ripping their customers off !  
1	  The battery lasts for about 10 minutes even with a full charge . I made the mistake of buying two of them for my husband 's dvd player and they were useless . What a waste of my money .  
1	  I recently bought two 25 bundle packs of these blank dvd 's . I have literally thrown out half of the discs of the first pack due to " bad media " - they will not allow data to be recorded onto them . I have now started on the second bundle and am having the same problem - out of four that I tried to record on so far , I had to discard two ! I contacted Philips about this problem several days ago via email and have received no contact whatsoever from them . Very poor quality discs - I will not buy their discs again !  
2	  This hub works perfect ! No drivers were needed for Windows XP and vista . Installation was a breeze . All devices were recognized with no problems . The only thing I wish this thing had was no power adapter but I know that 's not possible if you want something that 's able to power 7 devices such as this .  
1	  The prints I got with this from my Picturemate charm looked great , but the ink is a joke . It only lasted for about 60 of my 150 sheets of paper . I was printing sepia toned images , so I suspect that has something to do with it . Don't rely on the ink that comes with this product , always have at least two back up ink cartridges .  
1	  This was the first hdmi cable i ever bought . I was told by friends that expensive cables didn't offer more quality . After this experience , I don't know if I believe it . I read all the reviews and thought how great is it to find an $ 15 hdmi cable . Well now I am out $ 15 and have to find a new cable . Problems : 1 . Seller is listed as hdmi king through amazon . com . Yet it comes to me through some Abascus123 seller ? When I try to return it I have to contact some third party . Never had this experience when Amazon 's name is on it . Packaging was just a mailina envelope with the cord . Seemed like it wasn't new . 2 . The picture was fuzzy , it was like a 1985 TV screen ! My component cables were very picture perfect . 3 . After 2 weeks , the fuzziness slowly got worse . Now when any part of the screen goes black , blue lines streak across the screen . So much for HDTV ! And yes , all the cords are plugged in tight and I haven't run over them with a lawnmower or anything . Just want to share before you think you are getting a good deal but may waste money . Maybe it is just my cord or the seller that sold it to me . I am surprised by amazon 's quality to ship my order off to some third party . This is the first time I have received an item " supposedly " sold by Amazon . com but did not show up in an Amazon labeled box .  
1	  They don't bother telling you in the product description that this floppy drive can't be used to boot your computer system from this drive .. Had to find out the hard way after scanning the files on the driver disk and users manual where it 's noted in small print .  
1	  Ordered 3 weeks before Christmas this year . Was told several times that the frames were backordered and would not ship out until the week before Christmas , but that they would be expeditied . Come the last shipping day before Christmas and they are still backordered . Customer service is of no help . How is it that a company can make one ( and only one ) product and still not be able to come close to making Christmas needs ? I mean , they could have locked me ( 3 frames ) in for life as a customer with their wildly overpriced $ 12 a month service . The first year was included with the frames we bought , but I have no doubt that we would have kept the service for ease of use . I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN SCREW IT UP THIS BAD !  
2	  i read a lot of revues before purchasing this rca speaker wire . it is truly 16 ga . just as it was described , and if you watch the price it will change in your favor . great product .  
2	  Bought a new LG LCD tv and was disapointed in the sound . Bought a Vizio sb200 soundbar but couldnt connect it to the tv . What to do ? Cables To Go to the rescue - just what I needed to connect from the tv headphone out to the soundbar in jacks . Great price , fast shipping and now I enjoy deep , rich sound from my tv ( with the addition of a powered subwoofer ) . Can also use the adapter cable to listen to music cds thru the soundbar - the music sounds better than thru my stereo system .  
1	  The speaker came with a defective amplifier so the left speaker didn't work . We had to contact Klipsch Support . They were not surprised and immediately told us they would send us a new amplifier in 2 weeks . It has been two weeks , and we are still waiting for the replacement . I am wondering if Klipsch does any QA testing on the product .  
2	  I just installed the 4 port linksys and it is the easiest piece of hardware I have ever put in ! If you are going to use DHCP it is already programmed . My PC came up already connected to to ISP and I didnt have to go thru the programming . ( I did anyway just so I would know what was going on ) The 3 other PCs in my house came up just as easy . This is a great inprovement over MS Internet Connection Sharing software and a hub that I was using before . I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to share PCs over a cable connection .  
2	  I purchased this D-Link router to replace my old , 3 year old SMC n-router , which was showing it 's age . I 've been using this one for about six weeks now , and find that it works well and improves network speed . It is an improvement over the last router , but has some configuration " quirks " . Pro : The router is noticeably faster ( but not dramatically faster ) . It was easy to configure the basics , i.e. wireless security and SSID . It has a small improvement in signal strength and area coverage ( but not dramatically better than the old router ) . Port Forwarding ( for gamers , security cameras , etc ) is easier than most other routers to configure . Con : Configuring MAC filters was a pain ! The device ( computer , camera , printer , etc ) must already be connected to the router in order to be added to the filter list ( " allow " , in this case ) . Instead of just adding the MAC to the list and then configuring the device . The " status " display on the router does not show all devices attached in real time , and can be confusing . The router runs hot ( like most ) . However , when the router is set up vertically , for reasons of area footprint reduction and in order to get optimal air flow through the router for best cooling ( due to placement of the air vents ) , the display lights face down . This , in a way , is good , because they are bright blue , but it 's also nice to look over at them to get a brief indication of your network 's status when performance is lagging . Summary : Good router for the price . No harder to configure than the others ( they all have their " quirks " ) . It has improved the performance of my home network and I 'm pleased with it .  
1	  I got this as a gift from my uncle a year ago . After 3 months the right side broke . I sent it in for warranty and they shipped me new ones about 3 months later . I received them not too long ago and the headphones are broken yet again . Def not worth the headache even as a gift . I think the sound signature is also very poor . I appreciate bass and I can say that headphones with little bass bother me a bit but these headphones are nothing but rattling in your ear . Heavy on bass and everything else is kind of muffled in comparison with other headphones . Other headphones Ive had ranged from 20 dollar headphones to 160 dollar headphones . If I could recommend a headphone , I would go with the Klipsh s4 , their a better build and are more durable . Ive had those for a year now and no problems what so ever .  
2	  All I wanted were replacements for my 15 year old , blown out stock speakers . I couldn't asked for more with these . Installation was easy , and this sound coming from them , though not audiophile quality , is leagues better than 80 % of the stock speakers I 've heard on brand new cars . If all you want are replacements , don't hesitate !  
2	  I mounted the camera portion on the rear of my 19 ' travel trailer . The video potion clips onto the inside rear view mirror . It works great . Certainly makes pulling a travel trailer much safer . My only negative is that the installation directions could be much better .  
2	  i Just received my speakers today for my ipod mini . i Love it , its perfect for your room when you don't want to bother your ears with head phones or your office . i only see 2 problems , one is that the battery will have to be replaced many times or you will have to constantly charge your ipod but this problem can be solved by buying a wall adapter for the speakers . overall great product and worth the bargain , only 4 bucks ! One more great thing about it is , that it not only connects to the iPod , but nearly anything with a headphone jack ( computer , CD player , PSP , Nintendo DS , other name brand MP3 's .. Zune and anything you can think of )  
1	  First , it 's a fifteen-cent piece of plastic that is way , way overpriced . Secondly , it doesn't work . It falls right off . Never mind arguing about a somewhat loose fit vs . a tight fit . This just DOESN'T fit , period . You put it on ; it falls right off immediately . Pathetic , and even if it actually did fit and stayed on the end of the filter , it would still be one of those egregious price-gouging rip-offs that are all too prevalent in photography equipment .  
2	  At first glance , $ 25 seems a bit steep for two types of chargers and a cable . The quality of the products seems first class . I 'm glad I bought it . I bought it for my Sansa Fuze , but will instead use it to keep a Sony MP3 player charged and ready to go . I will , of course , use a different cable than the one that came with this .  
2	  I love the roller feature of this bag and there are a lot compartments for stuff . But with a laptop , office items , & a few clothes - it can be cumbersome and heavy . There is a sholder strap , but that 's why I purchased one on wheels - my sholder was always in pain from carrying my laptop . I would recommend if you travel often , but just note that it 's sometimes awakard to carry .  
1	  This is my second purchase of In-ear-headphones . I have a hearing problem and find buds more comfortable than the standard head phone but the soundwith these to me is close to nothing . The first ones are OK . I checked these against all the headphones I have and I suppose that is just the way theyare . Price was OK and that is about all . Reviews on Amazon were a little mixed on these .  
1	  After reading the reviews of Bose noise cancelling headsets ( QC2/3 ) , I decided to give the Shure E4c a try . I arrived at the airport earlier so that I have time to try things out . The earphone sounded just fine on their demo CD player . I didn't try it on my laptop , which is a mistake . On the airplane , I put this earphone is real test . Of course , the " sound isolation " works , ( put a piece of memory form in your ear , it will block the sound ) , but when I listen to some real music like the " Carmen - Act 1 Prelude " , the bass was totally cutoff . My broken $ 60 worth of Panasonic headset did so much better than this one . Besides the sound problem , I don't feel comfortable at all with it . As soon as my plan landed on the run way , I called the store , and they are kindly let me to return in Huston airport ( where I transit ) . I found their store , and the salesman listen my test music and had to agree with me and accepted return . ( GREAT SERVICE ! ) I ended up with Bose QC3 , which I am VERY happy with . My recommendation to everyone is to try this one with your own music source and pay attention to the peak bass performance . They have a great customer service and you can buy with confidence . But the little thing may or may not work for you .  
1	  Both items worked perfect for about 30 days , then the cassette started rattling to the point of being completely annoying and distracting . I had to throw it away and ended up buying an FM transmitter which works better . Both the charger and cassette have AWESOME retractable cords . I especially appreciate the charger having this because , well , for one it works , and for two I keep my ipod right next to my cigarette adapter . No long cords lying around ! If they sell these items separately go for the charger .. skip the cassette , it is junk .  
2	  Typical Sony high quality , seems to be well made , it is a large unit - I guess to accomodate the CD carousel . Controls are easy to use , remote works well , no problems reading any of my CDs . The only downside would be that the power button must be used on the unit , no power control from the remote . Not a big deal . Similiar ( or maybe identical ? ) unit at a local major retailer was significantly more expensive than Amazon .  
2	  I bought this item here a few months back to aid me in being able to help customers recover files from hard drives , transfer / backup files , etc . Setup was a piece of cake and installation under WinXP was a snap .. literally just flip the power switch on the unit and XP immediately finds the drive and adds it as Removable Storage under My Computer . Switching drives out is pretty easy as well since it 's a few screws , two connections , and you 're switched out ! When I am not using it to help customers , I use it personally for saving large files off that I need but don't want on my drives .. only complaint I have on it ( and it is a small one ) is that when it is sitting on my desk on its stand , the vibration tends to get on my nerves .. but I can't complain too much since I have not tried anything to help minimize the vibration . I just turn it on when I need it .. finish what I am doing .. and then turn it off .  
1	  I purchased this drive after reading through numerous positive comments . I am sad to say I have lost data 3 times now and am extremely gentle with the drive .  
2	  Although I am an avid lover of Apple products , I must admit that these headphones are much better than any headphones made by Apple . Apple 's earbuds are painful . They hurt my ears because they don't fit well . I decided to give Apple 's in-ear headphones a try too , and was gravely disappointed . These V-MODA headphones are amazing ! The sound quality is great compared to Apple 's earbuds , and these come with not only three different sizes of earbuds , but also a thing to wrap the extra headphone cord around , which was exactly what I was looking for . These stay in my ear well when I work out and run too , which is an extra bonus . They also come in a variety of colors .. what could be better ?  
1	  Nothing but problems with this printer ever since I got it . Random paper jams on printing , complete shut downs during photo copying , poor photo scanning quality , EXPENSIVE cartridges , etc . Got so frustrated with it a few days ago trying to copy a few things I literally smashed it to bits with 5 double-fisted over head blows to the printer . Best thing I ever did , forced me to get a new one .  
1	  This wonderful little hunk of junk came to me Dead On Arrival . For the price , I wasn't expecting much so good thing I set my expectations low . So if you choose to gamble on the idea that you 're going to receive a working product , then best of luck to you my friend !  
1	  I am a real person who does not work for , or have any relation to the company GPX . I , like many of you , wanted a bargain CD player . You get what you pay for . This CD player worked fine for about 2 months , then , it went crazy . The play button didn't play , the stop button didn't even stop . It didn't spin fast enough and the CD 's weren't recognized . The ESP caused more skipping than it fixed . I don't know who wrote all of those glorifying reviews but they don't have the same product that I do . Yes , the blue color is nice . That is why I give the product one star . It looks nice . If you want a decorative object , buy it . If you want a CD player , look elsewhere .  
1	  Bought the TV about 2 months ago , Picture is great everything worked , Sound quality is pretty crappy , the internal speakers are about as good as my laptops . But after about 70 days , the TV just shut off and wouldnt turn on again . Quite a waste of money , and even if you are covered in the warranty they take about 4 months to do anything about it .  
1	  only get this if it 's going to stay in one place , not bothered frequently . Easily damaged and rendered nonfunctional if tossed around too much or jerked in and out of ports too much .  
2	  I program and test web sites all day long , so I needed a mouse that was wireless , had good battery life , and one that I wouldn't make accidental clicks all the time with . Back / Forward buttons located where the thumb rests on the mouse had always been a nuisances for me . The location of them on this mouse is perfect .. I never hit them on accident . The wheel could be a bit smoother , but is a 100 % improvement from the other mouses I 've had . The horizontal scrolling doesn't work in all the applications I use but that 's not a surprise . As far as battery life , I 'm seriously impressed . There is room for two AA batteries , but I 've had only one in the mouse for over a month now and I 'm still going strong . This mouse is more than worth the money . I highly recommend it .  
2	  This bag is sexy , feminine , and chic . The only problem I have is that I think it should have the carrying handles on the outside which makes it more functionable to carry and made from the faux-croc . The handles that stores inside makes this laptop bag look cheap .  
1	  Ipod came shipped in about 3 days , everything looked great , started out great . But after the first charge expired it hasn't held a charge for more than an hour since . Really not happy about spending the money on this item , would never do it again . Actually trying to get my money back at the moment .  
2	  Everyone should use UV filters to keep from scratching those expensive lens . Bought two of these for my Sony A65 lens .  
1	  in that the disc only recorded on both sides for a short time . an error message appeared that the second said could not be use to record after about 4 or 5 uses .  
1	  I am still waiting for this article . I 've emailed the guyssupposedly sending this twice . He said he would look into it , but nothing has happened . What do I do next / Jim Malone  
2	  I bought these for 3 point n shoot cameras . Just enough memory for a person who doesn't take many pics .  
1	  I was disappointed at the instructions being less than heplful in knowing that the charging of the product for 4 hours prior to use was necessary or it would stop working . It was not revealed anywhere that the product had to be removed from car dock every day to be charged even if it was in the car charger and would stop working and have to be reset , which no instructions how to correct , warnings or directions are given . And last , not easily to get technical support on the phone .  
1	  Really erratic . I try batch converting files from a series ( e.g. , different episodes from the same TV source ) , and half of them get converted and the other half gets spit out because Turbo . 264 claims it can't handle DivX files . I 've downloaded the " required " software using Turbo 's link , and the same problem recurs . Whether a single file or a batch of files , Turbo . 264 just quits at different places when processing the same file at different times . So far , I 've given up using its software for conversions and have returned to opening an AVI file with QuickTime , then exporting to Apple TV format . It works fine as an adjunct to EyeTV , but I find it easier to record programs using my cable box DVR . I think the software should be renumbered 0.3 , not 1.3 . Also , I think it should have its own power supply because even when hooked up to a POWERED USB 2.0 hub , it sucks so much juice that a warning message pops up on the screen advising me that the hub is overloaded and I should disconnect some of my devices . Of course , I experienced dozens of trials with System Profiler not even recognizing it being connected ( because it was way underpowered and therefore invisible ) before I got the first overloading message , and then I isolated the Turbo . 264 as the sole USB device connected to a powered 7-port USB 2.0 hub . Then it was recognized ( but still crashes occasionally ) . At least Tech Support came up with the same diagnosis after I contacted them . Problem is , why isn't any of this in the small flyer of an instruction manual ?  
1	  I purchased this item in order to modem hotsync my Handspring visor . It has NEVER worked . It locks up during the sync process at User name . I tried to contact the company who , per there web site only offer email support for the product . I finally had to call corporate headquarters to demand a replacement . To their credit , they did send me another modem . To their discredit , it had the same remarkable low quality and inherent inability to perform as the first . Fortunately they were consistant in quality . Unfortunately , the quality was extremely low . I guess that the modem , like the army commercial was " being all it could be " , however , like some soldiers , all they could be is simply not enough for the task at hand .  
1	  Purchased my 500gB drive 11/8/2005 . Failed yesterday . Called LaCie . Jeremy at LaCie tech support was little help , other than to tell that it may be the power block , and to try buying one to see if that 's the deal . After opening up the case , enclosed are 2 Maxtor 6L25ORO 250gB drives . After some limited testing , they both appear good , which points to the bridge card . Crapola . Thanks , LaCie . I will say that I own 4 Porsche 250gB externals , and they 've been no problem at all .  
2	  I was concerned when I ordered this that it would be too big for my 7 " Samsung Galaxy Tab ( since the iPad is larger ) - but I just got this today , and it works great . Very sturdy , lots of different angles to adjust to . And the rubber on the feet and other areas of the stand keep the device in place , and the stand from skidding across my glass-top desk . Perfect ! :)  
2	  Excellent sound and I 'm not even through the break in period yet , I 'm using an ancient Onkyo amp , and they are playing 128kbps without any major distortion unless turned up 3/4 or more . I think since I only have 50 watts going to the speaker this is excellent . I highly recommend these little things .  
2	  A great 802.11b laptop wireless card that allows for easy connection of an external antenna .  
1	  I also just had to try one out for myself . What a piece of junk ! I 'm no iPod lover , but this thing pales in comparison . I felt like I was carrying around a sony walkman . The fake click wheel took me by surprise as it 's just simple buttons . The software and store r simply ridiculous . Almost impossible to use . CRASH - CRASH CRASH . you can forget about syncing this thing . The battery life is terrible with WiFi on . Which brings up the next point . I found the WiFi useless as nobody I know in their right mind will ever buy one ! I gave it a week and sent it back . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !

1	  I bought this drive about 5 months ago . Just this week it stop recognizing original CDs and CD-rs . When I try to burn a CDr in Nero , Nero spits it out and says insert a blank CD . Tried every different brand , updated the firmware , and finally called Sony to RMA the drive . I spent over 2 hours on the phones with techs who have gone over every single thing I 've already done before giving me an RMA number . It 's been a nightmare and I wouldn't buy another Sony product because of the poor quality and bad service .  
1	  After having read the specifications and looked at the pictures , the cables that I purchased were not the same as specified . This makes a HUGE difference when one is working on servers and doesn't have the luxury of spending 5 minutes dealing with the stupid ' cup protector ' ends : [ .. ] . Also , when I reviewed my order , I had specified " 7 foot " cables . It said that the cables were 7 foot , but somehow between that and my confirming , I got an email saying they were 14 feet and I received 14 foot cables . Thanks .  
2	  The filter holder fits my need perfectly for a compact holder for photographic filters . I can move them between my different camera bags depending upon what I need for that trip and the subject . Fits my 77mm filter just fine as advertised .  
2	  Great cable . Works really well . I have had it running almost all day and seems to work exceptional well . Was kind of skeptical when I got it for that low of price . But Definitey worth the purchase  
1	  its a good idea . however griffin executed iTRIP poorly . The frequency doesn't reach my car stero . not recommended product .  
1	  Sometimes I have to turn it off / unplug to reset the orb when it gets stuck and does not want to work .  
1	  I purchased this player ( RP2520 ) while on vacation . I had dropped my faithfull and workhorse AVC Soulplayer DMP-01 ( basically a Re-branded Rio Volt SP100 or SP90 ) while exercising . After five years of service , I needed an MP3 player to get me through my 20 + hour drive home . I only had MP3 CDs with me . I went to three ( national chain ) stores on my last day of vacation and this RCA was the only one that had easy folder navigation ( all my MP3 CDs contain albums , each in their own folder ) and it came with a car kit at the cheapest price anywhere . It seemed like a good value at the time . Well , you get what you pay for . The unit plays audio CDs without skipping at all , but MP3 CDs will lock and skip .. and I burn all mine to CD-Rs ( not CD-RWs ) . The problem gets worse as you get near the end of CD . Now , any album I have that is only encoded at 160kbps or less ( which is not very many ) plays fine . VBR ( variable bit rate ) and 192/224/320kbps encoded MP3 have trouble after about 1-2 songs . It 's as if the buffer gets full , and it 's all downhill afterwards . I use high quality name-brand CD-Rs ( Sony , Verbatim , TDK , etc ) . It doesn't matter which brand . MP3s all skip . Audio CDs and Audio CD-Rs all play fine . Strange and sad really . I tried returning the unit for a second player .. it did the exact same thing . So back to the store both units went . I guess I 'll try to find a used Soulplayer or Volt SP100 / SP90 / SP250 somewhere . My Soulplayer never skipped on me once ( too bad they don't make ' em anymore ) . I 've heard good things about iRiver players too , maybe I 'll have to look into those as well .  
1	  The single star is due to the frustration caused by dealing with this vendor 's so-called ' guarantee " . After only 10 months , the detector will not stay attached to the clip with the suction cups for attaching to the front window . Every time I turn a corner or hit my brakes it slides off the clip and falls on the floor , which makes it pretty much unusable . I contacted Escort ( who makes the Beltronics ) and they informed me that even though I have had this unit for less than 1 year , I would have to pay to ship it back to them for repairs at a cost of nearly $ 10 . What kind of guarantee is that ? I will never purchase another Beltronics / Escort item that can't be returned to a store if it breaks . Thank goodness I kept my old Passport unit to use while I deal with this frustration . This is the last Beltronics I ever purchase .  
2	  Fast easy set-up , no problems so far have had it 2 months . Would highly recoommend . Great price at Amazon got an extra 30 dollars off with Amazon visa .  
2	  I 've had the camera for a month now , and I really enjoy the quality of pictures I 'm able to take , particularly when I lower the ISO and take the picture in RAW format . Very easy to use .  
2	  This lil mp4 player is the best right now . I have owned one for over a year now , i use mine every day at college and in my car . The touch pad is sweet , gives it smooth navigation , no clicking and clacking . PROS - The LCD on here is BRILLIANT Samsung .. i have compared against the 16.7 million color ( this has 240,000 ) creative player and this one wins hands down . waay better color representation , and the blacks are black not all gray and blotchy .. and lastly the SOUND IS AWSOME ! has deep bass not found on others , also has bit expantion and SRS for a full and encompassing sound . CONS - the only issue it has is the video playback is only 20fps , ( though most movies are only 24 fps ) , so some chop when panning across scenes . also has issues playing some older converted avi 's . all in all has a few video issues , but to be expected since its an music player first . but this is a very great buy , quality built with a metal back similar to the ipod . great great sound , easy interface , plenty of room , FM tuner and recorder , read text files on it , built in mic , and plays most file formats and easy to load , just drag and drop music onto it and your good , no converting audio files , just video .. so buy it you should be impressed .  
2	  For the price of $ 40 , why not ? This lens fits my Nikon d90 well . Comparing this lens to the 18-105 mm Nikkor lens , this lens is actually smaller . I use it as a zoom lens . The only draw back to this lens is putting it on the d90 body . It 's backwards . Whenever I change my lens , I forget that I have to spin it backwards to snap it in . It 's not a big deal but I get what I paid for .  
1	  Ok . I don't know how you guys are doing it . I assembled the telescope ok with the supplied directions . I attempted to align the sighting scope with the mirror . It was way off and very difficult to adjust . It is so unhelpful that the spotting scope shows a world upside down and backwards . It constantly makes you move the telescope the wrong way to find what you are looking for . I also had difficulty with the up-down ( latitude ) adjustment . Why are there two locks for that ? If one is locked up you can't move the other one . Not user friendly for fine tuning . Not intuitive to me . I had no success finding a single object in the main viewer . I wasn't trying to use the magnifying eyepiece . If the spotting scope is no good and the eyepieces are no good , why have this thing ? OK , I am frustrated at the moment and will try again tomorrow . Other people have had better results so I will assume I just need more practice . I will change and delete this post if I figure it out . BTW , I have no telescope experience but have read scores of books on astronomy and I know , sort of , where good stuff is and what it is . I found the Andromeda galaxy easily in binoculars , but couldn't even get the scope on the Orion nebula , seeing all the stars around it with the naked eye easily . Later : Well , I have managed to find the moon and the Orion nebula . The spotting scope keeps getting bumped out of position so it is necessary to aim the whole telescope . With total manual controls , it is most difficult to find an object even if you are very close to it . But practice is helping . I don't have especially dark skies , so the potential of my viewing is unknown . The moon looked pretty good . With the Orion nebula , I could resolve only 2 of the 4 central Trapezium stars , but some nebulosity was visable . It looks nothing like long exposures from a big mirror under dark skies , but better than my big binoculars and much harder to find .  
1	  I tried it in San Diego for the first time and it could not find the Hilton San Diego Bayfront , even with address typed in . Not good . The touch screen and user interface are not very straight forward . Think twice before you get this model .  
2	  My fiance and I just purchased this camera and boy was I impressed ! This is our first camcorder but not the first one I have used . It 's light weight make it easy to handle . And the steadyshot works quite well . My hands are quite shaky but you could never tell by watching something I taped ! The picture quality is good , but I am only using the standard A / V cables . Once I get the S-video cables I should see a dramatic upgrade in picture quality . The battery it comes with isn't the best , only about 90 minutes fully charged . I particularly liked the nightshot feature . Although the images come out in a green tone the picture quality is outstanding . I was fooling around with it in a pitch black room and you could see everything clear as day ( green of coarse ) . The LCD is exceptionally smaller than the 530 but it is still big enough to fit most people 's needs . Of coarse if you want to save battery power just don't use the LCD . The only thing I can't comment about is the still picture option . I just spent a large sum of money on a straight up digital camera so I don't need to use that option . So I am sorry I can't help you out there ! Overall the camera is excellent and I would suggest it to anybody looking for a new camcorder .  
1	  Bad connection signal . Usually , I can't get my image signal transfer to a projector or TV . It 's really annoying when you try to use it .  
2	  I bought this B + W UV MRC filter together with my first lens a Nikkor 16-58mm for my Nikon D300 camera from amazon . com . The build quality of this filter is really good compared to my other filters from Hoya and Tiffen . I would buy the same UV MRC filter once I have my Tokina 11-16mm UWA . This is for protection of the glass from scratches and UV , first and foremost .  
2	  These are really the best tapes one can buy and they are no longer available at Walgreens . My son has to have them and we are happy we can get them !  
1	  I have had this keyboard / mouse combo for a while now and I have loved it . Lately , though , the keyboard just starts acting up . By acting up , I mean it stops working . The function keys ( E-Mail , Zoom , Windows key , etc . ) along the side seem to work just fine , but the letter keys are unresponsive . I 'm a software developer for a living , so this is just flat out unacceptable ! It seems to work better when right click on the " Medialife " icon on the task bar and click " Exit . " Don't know if that has anything to do with it or not .  
2	  Very well made , and looks great , even in the bedroom . Took less than 20 minutes to install and mount my 15 " LCD TV . Very pleased with this purchase .  
2	  Have had the camera for about a week and find that on auto that it is easy to use but once you go into the menus , there is a steep learning curve that will take forever to learn and it is very frustrating . The image quality to my eye is amazing again on auto but on manuel sometimes it works and other times it refuses to work . The flash is so bright that it washes out things and so I have to go to the low light flash and it is again not readily available but have to push buttons to get there . I am not sure had I really known all of this I would have bought this camera but maybe gone for dslr instead . Check it out carefully before you make this decision .  
1	  I have had numberous back covers and most of them crack at the corners a few weeks after installation . This one is still perfect . I love the rubberized plastic feel , helps with it not sliding around on your hand . Update : Had the cover for less than a month , and one of the tabs on the side that holds it on snapped off . I am not rough with my ipad , and it does not get dropped . I take very good care of things . Now it 's useless .  
2	  ( 1 ) The IBM Microdrive DOES work with the 995 ! I 've been using a 340MB drive and it works like a charm . ( 2 ) The new positioning of the flash virtually eliminates redeye in most conditions , though the flash is still much weaker than an external one . ( 3 ) It 's a little annoying that a case was not included , the bundled compactflash is only 16MB , and you have to buy the AC cord separately . ( 4 ) The auto-focus apparatus is a bit louder than other cameras that I 've used , especially with " continuous autofocus " option on . The optical zoom also seemed a bit loud . They don't affect the operation of the camera though . Also my hearing is particularly sensitive . I am still learning the wealth of manual operation features that this camera has . I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase !  
1	  I wouldn't get this product again for several reasons . It 's a bulky item and as much as I thought I 'd always want my player in the cup holder , often times I didn't . It 's difficult to see the display . There were plenty of times I had difficulty seeing what station it was set to . It doesn't hold the player securely . The player never fell out but going over even small bumps or roads that cause vibration would cause the connection to loosen . When that happens the sound isn't good . This transmitter has a cord that runs from the headphone jack to the base . It also has a slot to put the player in for charging . As soon as you put the player in the slot , it will turn on by itself . The player will sound through the car speakers if it 's just in the charger . It will also sound through the car speakers if it is just plugged into the headphone jack via the cord . However , unless you plug it into the headphone jack and the charging slot it will not sound the best . The cable it comes with is pretty weak and began crackling even though it was cared for and never kinked up or otherwise abused . Combined with the fact that the player can jiggle from the charger connection it makes for some very frustrating car rides . If you don't have a lot of room around your cup holder , or your cup holder gets in the way when it 's in use , avoid this transmitter .  
2	  The camera is amazing . Especially considering the price . The pic quality is good . Its light weight . The lense cover turns the camera on as well as protects the lense from dirt and dust . 5 ( x ) digital zoom is surprisingly clear . The Cammera didn't need drivers to be installed for it to work on Win 2000 . As soon as the USB port was plugged in from pc to camera Windows installed the Cammera as its own drive . From there its as simple as drag and drop . The few downfalls with the camera are that it is a bit to big to throw in your pocket . No optical zoom . The USB cable isn't the standard type , so this particular cable is the only one you can use to transfer files . Over All , Definatly a very nice product .  
2	  This review is for the Targus TXL617 17 XL Notebook Backpack . For some reason , the roll-on and carry case are also listed for the reviews here . As everyone else has said , this backpack is enormous . It is twice as thick and nearly twice as large as my standard Jansport book backpack , though not very heavy considering its bulk . Unstuffed , it 's about 3.5 " thick at the widest width and ~ 2.5 at the thinnest . The official dimensions as listed by Target are : 15.5 " x 8 " x 20.5 " . The pockets are well-divided into large areas and smaller areas . I especially like the big middle area for thick books and other general , non-paper items . You will not run out of space in this bag . I can fit my laptop , power brick , mouse , a weekend 's worth of clothes , several paperbacks , a toiletry kit , and a pair of tennis shoes without running out of space . The backpack is not free-standing . It also does not have a waterproof " rain skirt " ( bottom area of bag ) though it does look reinforced , in case that is important to you . The laptop compartment is extremely roomy . The actual open pouch for the laptop is held closed by a velcro strap ( I prefer snappable for longer wear value ) . The padding is decent on the sides and bottom , I would obviously avoid dropping the backpack even a couple inches to the floor still . There is zero padding at the top of the backpack where the opening of the laptop pouch is . Theoretically , the velcro strip should keep the laptop from sliding out if you for some reason manage to drop the bag upside down . Still , this may concern some people . The water bottle holder on the side fits a 750ml Camelbak water bottle , and would easily fit a one liter bottle of soda or whatever your choice of beverage is . A nice change from bags that have a " bottle holder " that will barely hold a 16 oz bottle . I am 5'7 " tall and the bag looks very large on my back even when not filled . The shoulder straps are pretty comfortable , but the waist strap ( which I don't like to use ) is annoying against the small of your back . The only option is to unsnap it and let it dangle while you walk . Also , since the photos do not show any picture of it , there is absolutely no channeling for sweat on the back of the backpack . Unlike many other backpacks , such as the Swiss Gear / Wenger line which have raised areas to help prevent the formation of sweat spots on your back from lack of air circulation , the Targus XL has the classic " smooth " quilted back that you see in normal book backpacks . With a laptop of this size , which normally you would intend to fill to a decent level since you are mostly buying it for the additional space , the omission of sweat channels is disappointing . I would not have purchased this bag had I known . ( Targus ' site doesn't have a photo of the back either ) . I have not used this backpack with a roller case , but aside from the top carry handle there is no other place to thread the backpack through roller case handles . This might be a problem if the backpack is very full since it would not allow the backpack to rest fully on the rails of the roller case handles . Regardless , for a sub $ 50 backpack it 's an excellent value and especially great for people who want to just carry one bag for weekend traveling . It will probably also be great for larger / taller people who have to carry several textbooks and their laptop to class .  
2	  This is a nice little switch . The cost is good . I use this to print to one printer from two compuers . The only con about this switch is that the software is not Vista compatible . I have to manually hit the button on the switch to print back and forth from one computer or the other . I 'm not even sure if you get the software to work that the switch would always be on for both computers to print anytime .  
2	  bought this item for a fishing trip to Canada , product worked just like it advertized , would recommend to anyone . For the price you cannot beat it .  
2	  I was looking inexpensive ( relatively compared to others ) headphones and did a lot of research . This particular set got great reviews and I decided to get them . The sound quality is great , I 've listened to better but not anywhere near this price . The sound is crisp , the foam paddings are comfortable and I have no problem with wearing them for extended periods of time . The only complaint which arn't really bad are that the cord can sometimes be too long even with the coiling and that the headphone top seem to stick straight out instead of rounding to the shape of your head .  
2	  This is used as a sheet protector for geneology papers . They work excellently as a way to preserve old letters , news clippings and typed pieces . I want to order more .  
2	  I live in a 3 story condo and I was having problems with my wi-fi . Problem fixed and my wi-fi is even faster now . It 's not as big as people say it is .  
2	  Bought this for my daughter for Christmas & she loves it , exactly what she asked for ! Fits everything she has and plenty room for more !  
1	  1 . I could barely get them on my ears without stretching them2 . Once I got them on they hurt3 . They were extremely uncomfortable4 . They were way too big around my ears5 . The earpiece wouldn't fit in my ear6 . The design is awkward and doesn't allow for good sound . Think twice before ordering these headphones .  
1	  i have a new Canon XSI and i have bought this product i have shot about a 1000 shots ( for 4 days ) in the desert and i didn't have access to a computer then when i went home i have had lost the first ~ 100 shots the computer and camera were unable to view those images .. i formatted the card with the camera once and with my reader once and i have the same result  
1	  While the price may have been a clue , the sound quality has been poor . Sounds muddy and muffled . No seperation or crispness . I tried the different options included in the packaging to get a good fit to reduce exterior noise . Any degree of effectiveness has been from pressing them to an uncomfortable degree into my ear canal . I do not recommend them at any price .  
1	  My daughter received this as a gift and it worked for over a year . Then the CD 's would spin and spin without playing . It kept skipping too . It 's too bad because it 's cute and compact in design . Between my experience and other reviews on this product , it seems that it 's not a good buy .  
1	  This is a great remote . Easy to use and program . I only give it one star because of the deceitful rebate programs offered by Logitech . I purchased this remote in Nov of 2006 and promptly submitted the rebate with all necessary UPC codes , receipts , etc . After an unusually long time , I checked on the status of the rebate only to find it was denied because Logitech claims I did not submit the UPC code from the box . This is absolutely false . Instructions were followed to the letter . Beware of rebates offered by Logitech . You won't get them .  
1	  The product looks fine , but as soon as I mounted it and started playing the radio and CD player , I found the sound to be very " tin like " and unimpressive . To make things worse , within 6 months , the CD player just stopped working for no rhyme or reason . One day I put in my favorite Italian CD and it would not even recognize the CD , so I tried several others ( all original CD 's , not home made ) . I then run 2 different CD Drive cleaners to clean the lens head .. no good . CD drive is busted . Very disappointing product . I am going to purchase the Sony mounted radio / CD player that has received much better review instead . I will be avoiding all GPX products from now on . Do not buy this product .  
2	  I happened upon this system when I was getting ready to drop quite a bit of money on a Bose system . I read the reviews and started doing some research . I went to the Klipsch website . There , they sell refurb models for $ 100 ! And that includes shipping ! I was a little apprehensive , as I don't usually buy audio equipment without hearing it . Considering the cost , though , I thought I 'd give it a try . I received my system within 4-5 days of ordering it ( not bad for the holiday season .. not to mention free shipping ) . First thing I noted was the look of it ; it 's very sleek and modern ( and goes very well with my black 80gb ipod ) . The only cosmetic issue ( as the result of buying a refurb ) was a slight scratch in the cradle that holds the ipod . That meant little to me , as it was covered anyway ! The IGrooveHG is a simple plug-and-play system , and it even has a handle . Both of these characteristics make it quite a bit more portable than the Bose system . I 'm not sure if I chose a bad song for it first off , but I wasn't initially impressed . I thought it sounded " okay " , and I couldn't expect much for $ 100 . But then , I switched to another song and actually used the EQ on my ipod ( big " duh " on my part for not doing that in the first place ) . The initial disappointed flew out the window . This thing sounded UNBELIEVABLE ! I played a Mozart piano sonata . It blew me away . Each and every note was crisp and clear . It sounded as though , truly , I was listening to my husband play it on our piano . I then ran through my catalog of music and played a little bit of everything ( ranging from jazz to rock back to rap to country .. I truly mean EVERYTHING ) . After making the appropriate adjustments on the EQ , every song sounded great . I saw that several complaints of rattling . I didn't have that problem at all ; but then again , I 'm also not trying to blast out my windows with a shelf system . I played it at a considerably loud volume , and all that rattled was the glassware on my countertop . I also saw that some people have complained about the remote . When I used it , it worked flawlessly . I do have the most recent 80gb ipod , so I 'm not sure if the problems are with older models or just with certain remotes . I would highly recommend this system to anyone who would like fantastic sound without dropping hundreds more on a Bose system . I was never able to listen to the Klipsch and the Bose next to each other . However , from what I can recall , the Bose did NOT sound hundreds-of-dollars better than the Klipsch .  
2	  I got this item last week with 6Gb . It 's a great device . It has good display and great features . The * MUSIC * that you want can easily be dragged onto the Sansa . The device automatically gives the playlists of artist , album , etc . The converter that comes with the item is really amazing . It was a big hastle to put videos on my PSP but the converter makes it so easy to put it on the Sansa 270 . You can put pretty much any type of * VIDEO * onto the converter and it will do all the work for you . Im not a big * PHOTO * person but the converter in suposed to be able to do that as well . The * RADIO * can almost always pick up channels very clearly and the recording of the radio is good quality as well . The VOICE RECORDER is very good quality . It is much better than any recorder that comes on a cell phone . The only few bad things about the Sansa e270 is that it does not come with a wall charger or car charger ( i dont think that they even sell them ) You can only charge the device by using the USB cord that it comes with to charge it in your computer . Also the Sansa does not offer a lot of storage space or accessories ( but you can buy extra memory to put in your expansion slot ) I encourage you to buy this great item  
2	  It works great and also you service was great . Thanks a lot . Berta  
2	  I 've owned these headphones for about a year . The earpiece part of the headphones are very comfortable and well-padded . My only complaint is that they look really dorky . I seriously feel like a goofball wearing them out in public . I 'm almost completely deaf , so I am not a particularly good judge of sound quality . What I have observed is that I can crank up the sound all the way on my IPOD and there doesn't seem to be any distortion with the Koss UR40 headphones . I keep wrecking in-ear headphones , even the expensive ones , because I max out the sound on my IPOD . Before I bought these Koss headphones , I was burning through at least one pair of headphones a month , which is why I decided to spend a little bit more money and buy these Koss headphones . The UR40s have lasted almost a year , so this is definitely a reason to consider buying . I treat all my headphones badly - carelessly toss them into backpacks , etc . , so it 's truly amazing these UR40s are still working great . Note that I paid 2x the listed Amazon price because I bought these headphones as an impulse purchase at a local electronics store . I highly recommend buying the headphones here from Amazon , at a significant discount over what they cost in the store .  
2	  For somene that wants a fax machine in the home for non business use , this is the model to buy , value priced , easy to set up and operatesflawlessly . It is a good value  
2	  top rated external ( .. ) ( the authoratative hard drive rating site ) and for good reason . Just to comment on some of the bad reviews below , I am sure anyone with a fair amount of technical experiacne can tell you that almost every bad review below is really based on ignorance as to externals , and the reviewers would have had the same exct issues with any other brand . I strongly recommed that you check out storage review . they have stats from thousands of these drives and for example these are much more reliable than the equivelent seagate , and Maxtor has better warranty response ( both are one year ) and support . Anyway although I roll my own externals , for the office we jsut buy them premade like this maxtor . I have four of them and they all run 24/7 ( they are known to run cooler than the seagate ) , and are frequently bounced around with no problems at all . As far as the " spin down " so worrying another commentor , I suggest he / she READ THE MANUAL ! For goodness sakes maxtor 's chipset allows you to have either 100 % uptime OR energy saving ( and with externals drive lifetime saving ) by giving the user configurable options on how quickly the drive will respond !  
2	  I love my Zune . I bought another for my son . Great screen . Easy to use , holds plenty - I dont need to carry around more than 7500 songs . The Zune Marketplace works great and they have a lot of off-beat ( no pun intended ) titles . I 'd like to see movies become available but that 's not a big issue for me . Just a nice thing to have . The unit is durable and doesnt scratch . The premium ear buds are really great . I bought the accessory kit that includes them , along with the Altec-Lansing speaker system so I can listen without earphones . That also is a very good quality piece of equipment .  
2	  I bought these at Circuit City for a considerably higher price but I most say it was definetly worth the price . I don't listen to rap but I listen to everything from the Dead Milkmen to NOFX to Slipknot and everything sounds great ! Some people say that you can't hear the bass line but all you have to do is adjust the amp level and you have your bass . I would have paid alot more for these if I knew how great they sounded ! I have had these for about a year and have yet to have a problem except having to replace the battery every other week for the bass amplifier . Excellent set of headphones for the price , you can't go wrong with these ! Edit : The reason I have to replace the battery so often is because I wear these whenever I go out of the house so they get alot of use .  
2	  I replaced the Infinity Gold speaker in my ' 97 Jeep with these . They more than met my expectations of what a $ 25 per pair speaker should be .  
2	  This is the best mp3 player i ever had , it plays , almost everything , mp3 , wma , wmv , mov , mp4 with excellent quality of sound . And a decent plus is the radio and you can customize the background . It plays the video with an amazing speed , and quality . Very Satisfied with product .  
2	  I use this for recording from my iPad or iPhone to a tape deck , and it works great . No problems .  
2	  My husband and I were about going crazy with all the remotes . We did not even look for a " one size fits all " because we thought we would have to spend a thousand dollars or more . Low and behold , I found the Monster when I decided to shop for one to give to my husband for this past Christmas . We have now used it for 6 months and we love it . It is definitely user friendly . This is the only remote we use . Be prepared to spend some time setting it up , but after all that , we have had only one issue with it : after we shut off the system subsequent to watching a DVD , when we go to turn the system on for just regular TV viewing , the right video number does not come on . We then have to turn the system off and then turn it back on . Everything is great after that . A minor inconvenience when we think about all the frustration we experienced with the handful of other remotes . We simply have not had time to reconfigure the settings and after all the reviews regarding the customer service , I am very encouraged to contact them and feel confident that this minor problem will be fixed . I highly recommend this remote .  
1	  This is the second pair I 've owned that have stopped working on one side . I thought perhaps it was user-error the first time , having caught my hand in the wire and yanked it a bit hard . But the second pair has gone the same way . Too bad , to . They seemed to stay in play under heavy activity ( running , mountain trail hiking ) better than others , but won't hold up over time . I got a good 8 months out of this last pair .  
2	  Was I surprised when I got this in the mail . It 's so tiny . Of course the item page didn't hide the size . It says " 5 inches " . I just didn't realize how small 5 inches was . So get your rulers out and see for yourself before you buy . But it 's very nice . It 's sturdy and you can position the bendable legs so many different ways . I got it for my Zoom H1 digital audio recorder and it 's perfect . I thought I could use it for my Flip Ultra camcorder but Flip has the tripod hole on the bottom of their unit but over to the side rather than centered so you have to go through contortions to position the tripod legs in a way so the Flip doesn't fall over sideways so I 'll just use it for my Zoom . And the price .. 2.95 . You can't beat that .  
1	  Pictures of the product offered were misleading . There was only the processor , and poor packaging . Pictures led me to to believe there would be original packaging , which included a fan . Also , if I had known it was processor only , I could have purchased it for less elsewhere .  
1	  I 'm very disapointed with this DVD because : 1 . Freezes with my DVD-RAM disks . I know they 're better than normal RW . I send 2 times to the technic service and they recommend me to use better disks ( I don't know where I can find it ! ) . When disconected and connected again , run normally for a while , so the technic service can't find the problem in 2 weeks and they return me . I have to film the problem to explain it , they told me have fixed the problem and now the DVD goes to the technic service for third time . Update : Now I have problems with the RW disks also . 2 . The remote control is UN-natural3 . Fast Forward or rewind is not FAST !  
2	  . . . where I had no access with my old wireless card . I didn't change my router , just the card . I have a medium signal up here , two stories and about 40 yards from the router . The signal is more than enough to compute comfortably and without hassle . The software installed quickly , and after the card was installed it found my network immediately . A goof proof installation that took no time at all . Nice product !  
2	  I have been a film camera buff all my life . I have looked at digital cameras for the past several years but was waiting on the features that I have in my film SLR 's . This was reasonably priced and pretty full featured ( lacking only in spot metering ) . I gave it a try . I am well satisfied with it . I have shot several thousand images and find the images more than satisfactory , the camera easy to use and am becoming a digital convert .  
2	  Get this product the thing works great ! ..  
1	  I 've owned Sony Walkman CD players in the past that were really good and performed well in my car . When my last unit started to have some problems , I immediate bought another Sony , assuming equally good functionality . NOT . This unit has no backlight - try to change tracks in the dark car . The BIGGEST problem for me is that there is no " resume " function as in past units and no way to retain settings . When you disconnect the power source ( as in shutting off the car ) you lose volume settings and track settings so the unit always goes back to track 1 as opposed to resuming where you left off . There 's an annoying beep if you change from one track to another also . You can turn that off but then when you shut your car off , the setting is lost and you have to reset the " beep off " setting . Lastly , the unit is hard to open . Not a problem if you 're using it on a walk but a big problem if you 're trying to change CDs at a stop light in your car or trying to do it in the dark . While the anti-skip protection is great and the sound is reasonably good , there just have to be better buys out there .  
2	  Lowepro Vertex 100 AW backpackVery good backpack for the price I paid . I got this as an open item from a camera store with all the attachments and padding . The original price is a bit too high and I would not have paid that if I had not found this deal . The bag is fairly bulky , but very well padded . There are alot of straps the just kinda dangle around and look messy . Unless you are using the Waist belt and chest strap for a trek , it looks fairly goofy . There is also no way to remove the waist belt when not in use . It would have been nice . The exterior is great . Very rugged construction and the weather proofing is a great feature . The fact it is all black and grey is also nice . The Tripod holder is very loose when not being used and bounces around alot . This can be removed when not in use and the straps that assit can also be removed or hidden . The two front exterior compartments are very useful for holding extra memory cards and lense filters . Great feature with easy , one handed access . The laptop compartment is so so . I do not have a laptop so I use this for storing my tripods pan-handle . It works nicely . It would be a slight problem if I did have a laptop because there is no specific compartment outside the camera gear space where you can store a wireless mouse , charging cable , ect . I personally dont want those items coming into contact with my camera , lenses and flashes . Now for the main compartment . The padding is nice . It has cloth sewn onto the walls to keep the main areas " rub safe " . I keep three lenses with lense hoods attached ( 18-55mm w / h , 50mm , 70-300mm w / h ) securely tucked in without fear of them falling or tumbling around . I also keep a point and shoot and 2 2.5 " externals tucked into one of the adjustable pockets . They fit nicely and do not fall out . I can keep everything I need to do outdoor photography with me at all times and not need to worry about running out of room . This is a great backpack for people who intend on being outdoors for long periods or expect unfavorable weather in their journey . If you are a sun shine only shooter and dont have alot of equipment to lug around , this backpack may be a little to much for practicality .  
2	  When I saw the price these cable were listed for I had some doubts . I ordered them anyway and turns out they work great . Totally satisfied with the product .  
2	  Unit has very useable features and is simple to use . Tones are a little annoying , but maybe this is a good thing . Memory function and volume control are very useful . Detection seems to be good . Lot 's of false alarms due to sensitvity being so high . This is a given trade off . Voice is easy to understand . Automute is a very nice feature in congested areas .  
1	  This card was to be used in my Canon Vixia HF100 camcorder and Canon SD800 still camera . After its 1st use it has developed a corrupt file system . I 'm not able to format it , as the file system is only recognized as RAW at this point . Sometimes the Windows command prompt function " CHKDSK / R " will fix problems with a bad index or file corruptions ( accessed via Start -> Run -> cmd ) , but I can't even get that far . My A-DATA 16GB SDHC C-6 has worked beautifully for >1 month and is less costly ( per GB , of course ! ) & faster than this model ( using the Vixia HF100 and SD800 camera ) . Given others ' ratings , I must acknowledge that my experience is likely the result of some fairly rare production anomaly .. I suppose even more reason to document it .. I 'm pursuing support options now & will report from that vantage point next . I will update this review and / or associated * rating with any change ( s ) , as warranted .  
1	  The features do not remotely live up to the hype . The base map is close to useless and without the addition to the add on map , will do no more than a $ 150 gps . If I still had the box , I would send it back  
2	  After Listening to all the logitech and Insignia ( and my own logitech ) units at Best Buy I came to this klipsch unit was BLOWN AWAY . THX certified for a reason I guess .. its just an orer of magnitude better than all the others . All of the other units had a hole in the midbass and no real low bass . These do a geat job of filling in the mid bass so voices sound warm clear and real . I prefer bass reflex over ported units but this one is quite good . The highs sparkle , the bass is real and I could not be happier .  
2	  These speakers are the perfect addition to a Yamaha receiver . They sound great and the piano finish gives them a very nice touch . These speakers allow you to enjoy a truly home theater experience ; the mids and highs sound great and the bass is very good . These speakers sound so good that sometimes I prefer to listen to music or concerts just with these two front speakers instead of the 5.1 setup . I took advantage of the bi-wiring capabilities , which I would advise to do it to take full advantage of these speakers . Please consider that these are big speakers for people who really want to enjoy a HOME THEATER experience . I would definitely buy them again !  
1	  The tiny media cards arrived in a huge box .. so much for the environment . But more disappointing , one of the media cards is completely dead after just a few uses . I bought these to be used in a Canon digital SLR and a Dell PC laptop . One media card is completely dead and can't be read / formatted by either the camera or the PC . A quick internet search seems to indicate a similar problem with the Transcend cards for other users . Buyer beware .  
2	  This is an excellent product for what it is : a stand for a MacBook Pro . The mStand gives you a nice area to store a keyboard or sleeve , puts the screen at a nice height ( especially when using alongside a Cinema Display ) , and is very sturdy and looks nice next to the Cinema Display . Not much more to say about it , except Yes , it 's a little pricey . But there 's really nothing else that compares to it , which is of course why I purchased it . BTW , I am using it with a new 13 " MacBook Pro and 24 " Cinema Display .  
1	  UGH .. I finally gave in to my husband who begged for TiVo at Christmas , but I didn't buy it until his birthday in March . Well , the lifetime subscription for TiVo service ( which was $ 299 ) is no longer available ( since March , just my luck ! ) , so now $ 299 only buys you 2 years of service . Furthermore , you can use your land line ( mine is stretched across my family room , in a great location to make my two small kids trip and fall ! ) or you can use your computer network to receive the programming from TiVo . BUT , you need a network adapter if you 're going to use the computer network method . The TiVo brand adapter is not even available on the TiVo website and it 's selling for higher prices on eBay . The other network adapters listed on TiVO 's own website are ALL discontinued and can't be found in any major stores . You can try eBay , but basically you 'll be paying a minimum of $ 50 for an outdated network adapter . ( Plus the cost of setting up your computer network if you don't already have one ! ) Don't try buying one that isn't on TiVo 's list .. they don't work . We 've been recording the HIGH quality level , which is like going back to our oldest VCR in terms of quality . So far , it hasn't been worth the cost the TiVo unit , the monthly service charge , the splitter that I needed so that I could use both my VCR and TiVo at the same time , and the network adapter that I haven't been able to locate yet ! The whole concept of TiVo is great , but think twice before buying ! If you 're not tech savvy , you 'll have a hard time connecting it with your TV / VCR / DVD player and your computer network . Good luck . By the way , the rumor has it that TiVO is coming out with a Series3 , which will include high-defition capabilities .

2	  authomatic , AP , SP , manual mode .. autofocus , manual .. flash , connector to ext . flash8 OPTICAL ZOOM ! works as CF-readercool rotatind lens .. great remote .. 2Mp for me is enough .. i do not know about you  
1	  It 's okay . The sound quality isn't amazing . The main problem is the very poor shuffle program that shuffles about 4 songs and play them over and over . I think for the price it 's a good deal , but personally I would prefer something with better performance .  
2	  What can I say , this is what the the folks buy who demand the best .  
2	  i was a little pissed off cuz it took more than the estimated arrival time for the item to arrive .. but it 's worth the wait . i have a 10 Mp Panny fz28 and this tiny card can store about 1000 pics . i am absolutely love it and i plan to buy another one .  
2	  When my wife and I went on our honeymoon , I noticed that she used the video recording feature of her then Canon A80 quite frequently . But the video was low resolution and only a choppy 15 frames per second . We had the opportunity to go to China recently , so we decided on this camera for our trip . The video quality is excellent and helped capture some of our experiences you can only recreate with video . Being small , we took it with us everywhere . I have never used an image-stabilized lens before , but now I 'm a believer . This is a great family camera-something small that you 'll want to take around . It 'll get great snapshots and capture video that looks good enough for DVD . Highly recommended .  
2	  I found this item pretty useful . It 's 2-step brightness helps . I even use this for reading purposes . Great buy .  
1	  I ordered and PAID for a 2 GB mini SD card for my niece to use on her mp3 player . Unfortunately , I received a 1 GB card instead . I 've sent several emails to the company ( including one via Amazon ) with no response . Don't order from this company or you might be very sorry .  
1	  I must say up front that up to this point , I have been very pleased with Epson printers . All have served me well , with a minimum of trouble . For that reason , I have recommended Epson to many people . However this model , the CX6000 , is a totally different story . On the positive side , it runs smooth , as quiet as I would expect from an affordable AIO , and has the right combination of features . The color LCD is nice , which really is a plus for direct photo printing . Draft printing is quite fast and definitely will save ink ( very pale - but still dark enough to proof-read ) . All in all , a nice machine . But it has one major issue - which I did not know about when I bought this unit . Incredible ink consumption . To date , I have printed some 25 text documents and 2 photos . All cartridges have been replaced at least once , the cyan twice , and the yellow and magenta already show 50 % after just a few pages . Now I understand that you should not run a tank-type printer out of ink , as doing so can do damaged to the print head ( s ) - so I can understand leaving some ink in the cartridge before you are forced to replace it - but something is wrong here , VERY wrong . Furthermore , if you print black text , the color inks go down like mad . On top of that , when the ink is out - the entire machine halts .. you can't even scan . Epson customer service is useless . Period . Thinking back to the Epsons I have owned and received excellent service from , I am shaking my head over this fiasco . Do youself a favor and avoid this model , as I don't expect Epson to make " things right " with this nightmare .  
2	  This iPod case will let you keep control of the click wheel and all ports will still be usable so you slip on the case and there 's no reason to take it off ( unless you want to stare at it for some reason ) and it has Star Wars villian Darth vader on the cover ( i don't know what 's on the back i have only read about it and seen a front picture ) i 've ordered one from ww . starwars . com already . over all if you love star wars and have a video iPod this is the case for you .  
1	  I only connected two monitors to it . A normal flat panel PC monitor and a projector . Neither of the two pictures were clear . Fuzzy and slightly washed out . I 'll be sending this back .  
1	  The product indicates Vista drivers . However , it doesn't state that it only supports 32-bit drivers . When contacting the vendor , they did not offer a refund nor any indication that 64-bit drivers would ever be available . Pretty sad .. 64-bit Vista has been out for almost a full year now .. I WOULD RATE it a ZERO , but they require 1 star ..  
2	  This Logitech keyboard / mouse combo is an excellent buy . In addition to all the regular keys , this keyboard also has enhanced ' F ' keys that are pre-programmed to do a number of different tasks like open Word , Excel , and Powerpoint . There are also ' Undo ' , ' Redo ' , ' Print ' and ' Save ' keys . there are also 4 user-programmable keys . To the left of the ' Caps Lock ' key are a ' Back ' and ' Close Window ' keys to control your browser . It took me a while to get used to these , but now I like them . The mouse is nothing fancy : your basic 3-button variety , with the middle button being a scroll wheel . The best thing about these devices is the lack of wires to clutter up the desk / restrain free motion of the mouse .  
1	  I purchased four of these for Christmas , and 3 of the 4 tested so far do not work out of the box .. the displays are gray and washed out , and the units only work when plugged in . I will be returning all of the units purchased due to this experience .. it 's a shame to give gifts that don't work ! Save your money and get one from an electronics store where you can test the unit before purchasing as problems with many of the digital photo key chains seem to be widespread .  
1	  I 've owned the Toshiba e740 for several months now . I bought it to replace an iPAQ 3670 which needed an external 802.11b PC card to do wireless . ( Very bulky . ) The e704 is a reasonable attempt at a self-contained wireless PDA . With built-in 802.11b wireless ( switchable in hardware and software to conserve battery life ) , it is a decent package . Much more compact than my Compaq iPAQ 3670 with an external 802.11b card . Unfortunately , the reliability is poor . The PDA kept loosing its memory forcing me to reinstall the backup software and restore the applications and PIM information . This was a major pain . Finally , the e740 stopped working all together . Push the power on button and nothing happens . The battery is fully charged , so it must be a failure in the PDA itself . Guess its back to the iPAQ 3670 for me !  
1	  This is the first wireless print server I 've bought , and although it saves me from having to run cords across a room , I find myself avoiding printing anything because the print server times out or somehow loses the connection to my printer , usually within several hours of resetting it , and at least once a day . That means that if I want to print for the first time in a few hours , I usually have to get up , unplug the print server , wait a few seconds , plug it back in , and wait a few more seconds before it realizes there 's still a printer attached to it . It also doesn't have a power switch-no reason it should apart from this problem-which means I have to unplug the A / C adapter from the back of the print server or unplug it from the receptacle . The technical support folks are friendly but unhelpful , since they really don't know a thing about this technology and just run through the one size fits all troubleshooting flowchart . After all is said and done , ta-da ! It still doesn't work ! One other problem I 've had with it is that it doesn't recognize my multi-function printer as a scanner . D-Link never promised that it would , since my Brother wasn't one of their test printers , but I was hopeful . And despite the set-up screen 's optimistic statement that if my scanner isn't recognized I just need to re-run the installation software that came with the multi-function printer , that extra step changed nothing . My printer is a Brother MFC-8660DN connected to the D-Link print server by about 3 ' of USB cable , and the print server is about 15 ' away from the wireless router . The reason the print server loses the connection is a mystery ; there are no network timeout settings associated with either the print server , the printer itself , or the wireless router that affect it , and there 's no correlation between the print server 's losing the connection and the printer 's going into sleep mode . Perhaps this isn't the best make and model of wireless print server or perhaps this technology just isn't mature yet . Or perhaps I got a defective unit or there 's just strange chemistry , so to speak , between the print server , my printer , and my network . Whatever the case , this is one peripheral that looked promising but has ended up creating as many new hassles and inconveniences as I had hoped it would solve .  
1	  These radios are not compatible with the Motorola radios being used by my crews . They are not receiving a good signal from even 2 feet away much lest a mile or more . I would not recommend them to anyone for purchase or use .  
2	  WOW ! I have to admit , I am very pleased , and surprised . I didn't expect the quality of the leather or the craftsmanship . I am impressed with the quality of the zippers and the leather . The workmanship , seams , and finish represent a higher price then I paid . Ater 3 years it is still going strong . Looks a little worn , but everything works and I hope to go another year or two before replacing .  
2	  I bought one of these little mp3 players several years ago from QVC , and wanted to buy another one for my grandson . I looked everywhere but couldn't find one like mine , until I checked out Amazon , looking for it . I shoulda checked here 1st ! Amazon 's got everything ! I can't believe this little bitty thing holds about 500 songs ! And it works great ! Now my grandson is jammin ' away with his new mp3 player ! Thanks Amazon !  
2	  Adult headphones kept slipping off my five year old . I found a Sony pair at Target made for kids , but there was a built in limiter that was so over applied that an iPod / iPad sound could barely be heard with any room noise ( people talking ) or road noise when in the car even when the iPod / iPad were maxed out on volume and not limited in the settings . The SONY headphones went back to the store . These had good reviews on Amazon , so I spent a few extra dollars , and it really paid off . These headphones have padding on each side and an audio limiter that connects in-line between the iPod / iPad headphone jack and the headphone plug . So , when the area is softer , we use the limiter to ensure my daughter doesn't turn the volume up too loud . When we fly or are in the car , we removed the limiter cable and she can hear the movie or music without a problem . These are much better quality than the SONY headphones I bought , and my daughter is really happy that they are sized for a child and softly cushioned to fit on her ears . I am very , very pleased with these headphones .  
1	  I 'm not sure if this is a product issue , or due to the shipping , but it turns itself off with just the slightest bump . I only brought it because we aren't allowed to have our mp3 players at work but are allowed to have a cd player . If you 'll looking for something like that , cheapper isn't better , go with something a little better ; if you 'll looking for something more long term and can get / use a MP3 player , do the research and get a MP3 player that fits you 'll needs .  
2	  Good tuner for me . Picks up all channels in the area and only one of those freezes occassionally but that could be the source . nice price

1	  Yes the color of the print on this paper was very impressive . The thickness was also nice . Then the problems start . I have let the photos dry for 3 weeks . They still got screwed up when I put them under a glass frame or in a photo album . It is like the ink never really dried . You would think for what they charge HP could make a gloss paper that works . To top it all of if you get just a tiny bit of moisture on the printed photo the ink wipes off . Save your money and ink !  
1	  My Grado 60 is more than 17 years old . The Grado 60 has clearer high , more natural mid , deeper low and richer sound stage than this new Sennheisher 280 Pro I received today . The 280 does have better isolation due to enclosed design . That isolation also comes with a price , it get hot very fast while I can listen to the Grado 60 for over an hour without notice any heat or fatigue on my ears . I had my wife and son listen to both on various songs , with the volume lower on the Grado since that headphone is more sensitive than the 280 , we have no doubt the Grado 60 is much better sounding than the 280 after 3 minutes . The Grado 60 cost me 69.00 years ago and it is still selling at that price , cheaper than the 280 on special sale . If you want to buy this unit , you owe yourself a listen to the Grado 60 first .  
1	  I bought this thing becuase I use voice recognition with my computer and I 'm on the phone quite a bit . it was supposed to eliminate the need to for two head sets . With the amplifier and the plantronics headset to go with it The total cost came to around $ 200 . Yay ! The amplifier has a strong hum when used through the phone and when I use it witht eh computer it has such poor sound quality that it doesn't work with my voice rec . software . I called customer service and they said I should send the unit to them and they would send me a new one . Funny , I have read that in a few places online . I went out and bought the Labtec equivelent , the dialog-301 at a whopping $ 15 ( headset included , the head set is cheap though ) and it is chrystal clear for both the phone and my computer . Plus if you want to upgrade the head set you can buy any analog computer headset . Save yourself $ 185 and just buy the dialog-301 you will be happy .  
1	  Volume control stopped working the morning after we unpacked it . Now it works only on high , with lots of static . I wasn't expecting much sound quality at this price point , but this product is ridiculously shoddy .  
2	  Great sound for a 2 speaker system . I bought the black ( a little more expensive but go well with my IBM T30 ) .  
2	  I am new to photography and wanted to jump into every aspect of it . I bought a high end lens to work with everyday pictures but after looking at some up close photos wanted to try that . I bought this lens to attach it to the 50mm lens .. I love it . It allows me to get much closer to the subject . Well worth the money in my opinion !  
1	  In a short time , the wire around the headpiece came out and the earplugs came apart . Very disappointing product . Ray  
1	  This item broke after 11 uses and stopped working with the radio at that point I discarded it I won't purchase it again  
1	  this product will last 2years , if your'e lucky . Great features , but if router or modem doesn't function your'e up the creek . If you do decide to buy it or any other product buy directly from amazon . com ( not someone selling on amazon . com . I got taken for $ 200 that way with no way to get my money back ! )  
2	  Hated these the first time I put them on . They initially entangled and ate my hair at ear phone expansion points when trying them on the first time . Ever since then .. they have not done so , fit very comfortably . Sound quality is the best I 've ever heard on headphones .  
1	  I 've had my SG300 for 3 years now , and it inexplicably stops on its own ( you can hear an internal shutoff click ) and , ultimately , freezes , and all data is lost . It failed from the first time used . If I attend to it by not letting any time lapse , I 'm ok , but that 's hardly reliable ! I 've initialized countless times over the years . I 'm on a Mac . The software that came with it was for a PC . In case it 's my mistake ( not knowing how to use it ) I 've talked to countless people ( PC / Mac ) and researched on the web and no one has a solution , but I AM reading about similar complaints . I use it ONLY as my secondary backup , which I keep offsite . My firewire LaCie Porsche , on the other hand , works flawlessly ! I don't take this SG seriously .  
1	  I bought the CR79 because I wanted something that would look nice in my paneled livingroom . I chose this model specifically because of the external speaker outputs . I thought that if I did not like the sound quality of the built in speakers , I could hook up my own . Let 's take the features of this item one by one , in the order of from the worst to the best . The CR79 has the cheapest looking turntable I have ever seen . It would be very easy to break something just by inattention . I put a good quality stereo record from the 60 's on it , and the sound was like something from the 1930 's or 40 's . My wife described it as " music in a can " . The AM / FM radio is better , but the sound is all in the mid-range , lacking any real base or clear highs . The reception wasn't too impressive , either . The tape cassette was considerably better . But I had never before seen one where you have to open the door by inserting your thumb into a hole and prying it open . No button to push to eject ? The CD player has better sound than the phono , radio or cassette , but wouldn't you expect that anyway ? Even so , it still lacks range . The CR79 's best feature is its appearance . There 's no denying it looks nice sitting there in the living room . It looks well put together , and does not dominate the room . The wood finish looks like a rubbed oil finish that might not be all that durable . A coat of urethane would be a good idea . It 's too bad that the Chinese manufacturer of these units did not make them sound as good as they look . This unit is overpriced for what it delivers . It is not a sound system at all , but really just a home decoration item . I returned it to Amazon the next day and ordered the TEAC DC D6300 . It is everything the Crosley is not and five dollars cheaper as well .  
1	  I bought it in December , 2003 . From the very beginning , DVD-R 's would occasionally freeze and then , after a few seconds , would recover . However , commercial discs played without incident , so I believed the problem was the DVD-Rs . I was wrong . After six months of service , even commercial DVD 's began to freeze . Finally , in June of 2004 , it totally died . A commercial DVD ( The Wizard of Oz ) froze after 10 minutes of play and the machine never recovered ; it failed to recognize any type of disc , and is now garbage .  
2	  After much hesitation whether the Belkin CushTop will properly ventilate my new laptop computer and reading other people 's comments to ensure it does the job it said it does , I ordered it on Amazon . com . And I 'm happy to report it works really well . The surface of the CushTop is firm and so it allows that ventilation gap for you laptop 's heatsink and fan to operate properly . It offers very good height for typing and viewing the screen when you have it on your lap sitting on the floor or on the sofa , which is where I use my laptop . All in all , I liked it so much , I got one for each of my two siblings for Christmas .  
2	  love the bag - small and compact for a laptop - has room to keep charger etc . Looks very stylish . I just bought it - so can't say about durability . But overall satisfied .  
1	  I was given this as a Christmas present . The idea behind it is great . I used it with my Averatec tablet . Soon after using it , the battery life dropped to about half . I purchased a tip for my phone . First time I used it , the charging was done in 10 minutes . The battery now only gets 3 days where I was getting 5 . I replaced the battery and still get the same 3 days . I 've sent emails asking about tips for other items and have not received a single response . In addition , I sent an email asking about the problems I had after using the device , again , no response . Use at your own risk .  
1	  Not a true " mini " mouse . It is about as bulky and cumbersome as the cheapy mouse that comes with bundled PC packages . Not at all suitable for small hands ( or people with a hand disability ) as it so claims . It may have fared better had Belkin omitted the word " mini " from its name . A hassle downloading drivers which were not easy to find on Belkin 's site . Also , there was no USB-to-PS / 2 adapter in the package ; you 'd have to call the vendor and special-request it which they ship to you standard . They don't expedite .  
1	  Shredded paper goes in your recycle bin ; plastic bags do not . I had not thought of using a bag , but there are biodegradeable tall kitchen bags and smaller food waste bags that I guess could be used .  
1	  Don't buy this scanner . I 'm a light user , and this scanner failed after 18 months . The software was okay , the hardware quit working after the warranty expired , and the scanner unit needs to be replaced by a repair center . It 's so costly , the repair is not worth it . Do yourself a favor and go with another brand .  
2	  So far , so good . Can't beat the price when you consider you 're getting two 2400mah batteries . Love the abilty to use AA batteries if I get in a pinch . I have the grip attached to a Rebel XTi and love the way it feels as apackage . Stabilizes the platform well .  
2	  The Sony CMT-NEZ30 offers a good amount for a stereo this size , as it truely is tiny , and is great for those that dont want to sacrifice a lot of space , or have a mini-system that looks like a kids toy . This is perfect for your bedroom , kitchen , office , or den , as once again , it is small , and it even looks great sitting on top on your furniture as its speakers have a simulated walnut color to make it blend in . As for the sound quality , it produced a nice clean sound for the size ( the speakers woofers are only 3 1/2 inches ) , and it has lots of features such as a loudness / bass boast button , and seperate bass and treble controls . The 30watts is a perfect size amplifier to produce decent sound levels for a small room . It does have some disadvantages though . First off , even though the sound quality is good , the bass reponse is a bit flat , and even though you can cut the treble down , its a little bright on the high end , but once again , I only reccomend this for a small room , if you are looking for a micro system that is going to produce deep bass reponse for you living room or dorm room , then I dont reccomend this . Once again , if you want something that sounds better then a boombox , and looks better too , then this is a great system , and even though Sony is usually overpriced , this is a great buy , as strange as it is , Sony Audio is always usually resonable priced , unlike their TV 's or Playstation 3 which cost a bloody fortune . Still the best in its class for the price as the Panasonic Micro system which is a bit smaller then this , and about ten bucks cheaper , sounds horrid , and has no volume , so this is the way to go for a micro system unless you feel like shelling out a thousand bucks for a Boise . ENJOY  
1	  This is without a doubt , the worst printer I have ever purchased . I bought this one to use on my HP computer , as I use a Photosmart 1115 with my Power Mac G4 and it is excellent . I figgured the extra inking would be better on the PC . WRONG . So I tried it on the Mac , it is SLOWER . It runs about 1 page per minute and a half . A color photo takes 5 minutes , and this is a small 4x6 print . I 'll keep the 1115 . It has better photo quality also . AND , the smart card reader is also slow . The 1115 reads the same photos in 1/10 th the time . I will never recommend this printer to anyone .  
1	  This is stranded aluminum wire . Aluminum is 1.58 times more restive than copper . Thus a 1/0 AWG aluminum wire is approximately equivalent to a 2 AWG copper wire . This may make a world of difference in your application ! Additionally , others have stated this wire appeared to be less than 1/0 AWG . I measured the core diameter with my caliper and it appeared almost exactly . 325 inch ( 1/0 AWG ) ( it 's always tough measuring stranded accurately ) . So at least you know the product 's labeled gauge is correct . Do a quick search for " aluminum vs copper conductivity " for more properties of aluminum vs copper wires to see if this suits your application .  
2	  I am a mystery shopper and this is a great recorder . It is easy to use and it picks up voices from a pocket in my purse . I also use it with a microphone . You can file the voice recordings into different folders and the recorder is small so it is not obvious . I am very pleased with voice recorder .  
1	  I am greatly displeased with this headset . I wanted something wireless for use on my laptop but this thing is static city . It would drop channels like no tomorrow and constantly shut down . I 've never had any problems with my wired ones . So , moral of the story , if it 's too good to be true , it probably is .  
1	  This is a follow-up of my prior review . I have received a replacement product ( not new as was mine ) and it does work for now . I asked that they simply replace the Velcro strip on the back of the case since it can't be purchased from them on-line . After 3 calls to support , they refuse to help me with this 10 cent part . I 've never been so frustrated with a product in my life . I 'd think twice before you buy a Palm product .  
2	  Popped the card and the disc into the system , let the OS do the install , and boom , I had audio . I 'm only using the basic stereo output with the supplied drivers & basic applications like Media Player , so I can't comment on the capabilities of the card or the Creative applications beyond that . On a side note , I needed this for a system that I know to be electrically noisy , and this card does not seem to be particularly susceptible to it , with little of the noise leaking into the audio . If what you want is a bssic card with a no-hassle install , you should be happy with this one .  
1	  I was a latecomer to the MP3 scene but I finally gave in about a year and a half ago when I picked up the Sandisk Sansa 8gb . The thing was a headache right out of the box . The software was useless . I couldn't for the life of me get it to work without crashing or freezing my Sansa . I gave up on that and went with the drag and drop method which was much simpler and faster and , for the most part , that worked fine . However I quickly discovered that if I wanted to add videos and photos to my Sansa , I HAD to use the software . If you drag and drop videos or photos , they won't be viewable . It makes absolutely no sense , but I gave the software another shot with no luck . I finally emailed customer support and they pointed me to a download of an older version of the software and , YAY ! It worked ! And about 5 minutes later it stopped working . My Sansa started sporadically disconnecting and reconnecting , interrupting the transfer and forcing me to restart the process again . Extremely frustrating . All that said , if you can deal with the frustration , the Sansa performs FAIRLY well .. I had a handful of incidents where the unit would just freeze up for no apparent reason and the delay when deleting a file or making play lists , for example , was horrid and made the features not even worth using unless you didn't mind wasting copious amounts of time . But when it wasn't lagging or crashing , it worked fine . It was a nice , small size and fit into my pocket without being noticeable . The wheel and buttons were responsive and worked well , for the most part . Though I was constantly annoyed at the inability to easily browse through my music the way I want to . I tend to arrange my folders in such a way that I can easily find what I 'm looking for , and with the Sansa there is no option to just browse the hard drive and folder structure . It 's very limited and close-minded , considering how easy it would be to add such a feature . I now own a far superior ( and far more expensive ) Archos 5 160gb and though it 's bigger , it is a beautiful piece of electronic goodness . I 'll never buy another Sandisk media player again . Avoid !  
1	  Smart Strip SCG4 failed after a short while . When it switched on it would just buzz . Also , before it failed it was nearly impossible to set the adjustment so that it would switch on and off when I turned on / off the laptop connected to the control outlet . With the short life of the product , I 'm sure I never saved the cost of the outlet strip in electricity savings .  
2	  great sound , good bass , loudest cheap earphones you can buy . only one drawback , and i guess its my fault anyway - where the wires go into the earphones , they can break if you dont take care of them . so dont keep wrapping them around your ipod . this only occurs after a good 6 months of use , so for the price , its definitely worth it . ive had 3 pair , and its the same problem every 6 months , but at this price , its not a problem to get another pair . better than spending 40 dollars on a pair that do the same thing at 3-4 months .  
2	  This was the perfect piece to use for working out . It holds more than enough songs and it is easy to keep up with than my 30gig  
2	  I 've had this handheld for a year now . To be honest , it was given to me as a Christmas gift , and I wasn't exactly thrilled about getting it . I was like , " What do I need a datebook for ? " I am eating my words . I love this thing ! Not only can you use it to jot down your appointments , but you can set alarms and look WAY into the future . There 's a world clock , memo pad , a to do list , a decent calculator , and much more . However , what I like best is how you can download tons of games and share games with other handheld owners . I have bought Word and Excel to go on my handheld , and I 've purchased the fold up keyboard , too . With this , my handheld is better than a laptop ! I can work on papers at school without lugging around something huge ( which is ideal for any college student ) . Plus , it 's super easy to hotsync ( storing stuff from your handheld to your pc and vice versa ) ; all it takes is a touch of a button . While I love this handheld , it does have a few flaws : 1 . Sometimes it freaks out , and you have to reset it , losing your info . However , when you hotsync , you get all the programs and files back ( that you have saved on your PC ) on it really quick , so you never have to reinstall software or anything . Plus , you can buy an attachment for about $ bucks or so that acts like a disk , so you can save your info . This is handy , so I suggest getting this if you are going to be doing a bunch of work on it . 2 . It 's not in color , and from what I 've seen so far , you can't get pictures or anything on it . ( If I 'm mistaken , then I 'm sorry ) . 3 . If you like cuteness , then you may not like this one . There are many cooler looking handhelds out there ; this one is kind of dull . However , for the price and its capibilites , it 's worth the buy , no matter how it looks . - This is a great choice for a first handheld !  
2	  I 've had this TV for a month now , and am impressed with its picture , style , and the number and type of connections on the back of the TV . It is a " Best Buy " in my book , plus March 2007 Consumers Reports gave the Olevia a pretty good review . There are two annoyances that leave it short of five stars : ( 1 ) the TV is not able to be controlled by my Comcast-provided remote , and the Olevia remote can't be programmed to control all the features of the cable box - therefore I have to use two remotes ; ( 2 ) there is a piercing blue light that emits from the on / off switch when the TV is turned off , so if you have this TV in the bedroom , you 'll have to put a little piece of black electrical tape over the light because it is so uncomfortably bright .  
2	  I have used the 2 light set for over a year now , and this is a great improvement . Very easy to use . Works just great for the photography enthusiast !  
1	  My Zen Vision M locked up several times over several months . The last time , it was permanent . I had to contact their customer support to begin the process of getting it fixed in the middle of January . I received incorrect information regarding product availability , long waits for the sync adapter to come back into stock before I could attempt to reload firmware ( I lost it ; my mistake ) , and finally after getting an RMA approval have now been waiting 17 business days from their date of receiving it for them to get replacement stock . They quote an average of 10 , but ask you to contact them if it is longer than 15 days . I have been told that they are going to replace it once they get stock back in . Although they have units to sell in stock , this does not mean that they use them to honor their warranty with . They will not give any sort of estimate when they may have replacement stock . Also , their web RMA status page may not get updated , or may post incorrect status . Oh , one other interesting feature of their support is that if you don't have a support contract and the unit is older than 3 months old , you have to pay another $ 25.00 for the testing . In the almost 2 months of dealing with this , Creative Labs has lost me as a customer , which I have been for over 10 years . Aside from the lockups , I liked the unit . I now have an iPod that I love and also had to use Apples ' Customer Support services . No problems . They dealt with the problem in a professional and efficient manner .  
2	  I held off on buying these for a while since they were so inexpensive , I couldn't imagine they worked all that well . Instead , I read some reviews and got the Sennheiser PXC 250 , which fold fantastically small for travel with good noise reduction . Big problem though : they are " on-the-ear " phones , and very uncomfortable for long periods since they push your ears into your head . I fly cross-country and internationally quite a bit , and I found I couldn't wear them for longer than 2 hours without actual pain . Noise reduction and sound quality are useless if I can't even wear the headphones ! So comfort became my # 1 criteria . I demoed the Bose Quietcomfort 3s , and they are very nice , but there 's no way I was going to spend $ 300-350 on headphones . I finally bought these , immediately put them on and wore them for over an hour , and they are incredibly comfortable for me . Noise reduction seems decent , and sound quality is good if a bit boomy on the bass . Amazon was $ 12 cheaper than Target . Very happy and difficult to beat for the price . Anyone want some PXC 250s ? :) Pros : Extremely comfortable for long periodsBattery stored inside headphone itself vs . dongle or boxBattery and airline adapters includedCons : On / Off switch hard to activate , especially when onA little bulky for airplane travel  
1	  If you ever need to take indoor shots in succession , DO NOT buy this camera . I loved my last Canon and went with this one which was newer , but in the same series . The recharge time for the flash is terrible between 7 & 15 seconds and really makes a difference when you 're trying to capture the perfect shot . The reason seems to be that this model only uses 2 batteries . The A620 is entirely worth the extra $ 100 since it has 4 batteries and the fold out screen .  
2	  These earbuds stay in place and offer great audio reproduction . It seems a little tinny on the higher tones , but has good bass and overall great audio response . I highly recommend this product . I 've tried a number of products trying to find one that will fit in the ear and stay there . This one does the trick .  
2	  This is my first DSLR camera . I bought this to learn photography . I would say that this camera is worth for the price . I would suggest to buy just the camera body and go for a better lens . This camera has decent enough features for a DSLR . This does not have the live preview option though .  
2	  hooking up computers and cables and other items that go with them can be extremely aggravating and you may feel like you need a computer to figure it out however this purchase was very easy and this product was exactly as described and worked perfectly .  
1	  I cannot get this cover to fit the new iPod Nano . Maybe it fits the old one ..  
1	  The HDMI cord doesn't work for me . I tried it out on three different HD T.V. 's and it didn't work on a single one . It was constructed well and seemed to be a good product , but I can't really get past the fact that it doesn't work . It may just be my cord as I have seen plenty of other reviews that say it works perfectly . I decided to go with this one . Mediabridge Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet - Category 2 Certified - Supports 3D & Audio Return Channel [ Latest HDMI Version Available ] - ( 6 Feet ) . It 's a couple bucks more , but at least it works .  
1	  This crossover cut out the mid-range . My music sounded very " empty " , it was nothing but weak highs and muddy lows . After a month , and thinking that it was the speakers that were making the music sound bad , i unplugged the crossover and hooked the rca 's from the head unit straight to the amps . The sound was perfect . I suggest , don't waste your money on this , and use the built in crossovers on your amps . I 'm not even going to resell mine , i 'm just throwing it away . I wouldn't wish that kind of sound on anybody .  
2	  I bought this for my son and he loves it ! It is easy for him to download music onto it and it holds alot of songs ! This is also a very sturdy product , my son takes it to football practice with him !  
1	  I purchased this drive from Amazon . It lasted a little over a year , then died . Since I had been using Western Digital drives exclusively since I started building computers in the late 1990s , I assumed that this was a fluke , and I purchased and installed another one , same model as the one that died . The second one lasted a year and a month before it also died . That 's it for me - one failure could be a fluke , but two virtually identical failures is a design and / or quality problem . I am now through with Western Digital . Something has apparently changed , and not for the better . If you do buy this drive , you better be very sure that your data is backed up somewhere else ..  
1	  After two months of use I noticed severe data loss .. pictures from my vacation became unreadable . I thought it was just a one-off but so I formatted the card ( in my camera ) and used it again . Low and behold .. same thing . Some pictures became unreadable and lost again . Wouldn't go with Transcend ever again .. I 'm going with Kingston .  
2	  I purchased the speakers at a sale price of $ 49.95 , but these speakers are a great deal even at the regular Amazon low price . I had a front speaker that was getting a little fuzzy sounding on my car and needed a replacement for the factory speakers and these certainly filled the bill . The quality and clarity of the sound is fantastic ! I am really impressed at the difference between the stock speakers and the Infinity speakers . It has made a world of difference in my daily commute and occasional trips .  
1	  I would agree with the nay voters here . I have a 15 " LCD on one 75/100CL , a 20 " LCD on another , and a 23 " LCD on another . All three are well below the recommended weight limits of this mount . Still , all three of the LCDs drop to the lowest angle regardless of how tight I adjust the screws . If you are mounting high on the wall with the intent to view from a MUCH lower angle and about 10 feet away , then I guess this mount will work for you . Otherwise , look at other manufacturers for mounts ! This was my first Omnimount purchase ( s ) ( I bought 6 mounts total ) and will definitely be my last . I am underwhelmed by the " quality " and the claims printed on the box . ADDITIONAL ( 2/22/06 ) : Two evenings ago , I heard a loud crash from upstairs . Last night , I found out what it was . It wasn't the cat knocking something over . My very expensive , delicate 20 " monitor , which only weighs 19 pounds , violently fell against the wall to the mount 's lowest position . The clamp plate had cracked ( the plate that clamps onto the horizontal pivot bar ) . This although the monitor is well below the advertised weight and size limit ! I called Omnimount ( I was very polite ) and told them what had happened . I was merely asking that they send me a replacement clamp plate . It would be easier for them , and easier for me since I wouldn't have to completely remove the entire mount from the wall , get in the car and drive across town and stand in a customer service line and drive back home and remount the whole thing ! Add to that the wall screws that come with it are HUGE , and almost 4 " long . While that is great for keeping it firmly attached to the wall stud , getting the screws into and out of the stud is very difficult , even for someone with a lot of arm strength . They wouldn't do that . They demanded that I take the WHOLE MOUNT to the store . Complete drivel , and in the long run , more costly for them since they are getting a whole mount back instead of just sending me a part ! Although they claim that the mount has a two year warranty , this is a poor way to deal with it . One other thing .. they offered to send a retrofit kit to repair the other drooping mounts ( how long till THEY break ? ) . The kit consists of longer screws and Thread Lock . I have serious doubts that Thread Lock is a long term solution ! What also confuses me is that if they are sending me several of the " Fix " kits for my other 75/100CL 's anyway , then why couldn't they also throw in the clamp plate ? Bottom line .. stay away from this mount for the above reasons . I am scared to death that soon I will have other monitors crashing to their demise .  
2	  How did I finally get it to work ? I followed the setup guide carefully . I did everything the manual said to do , step by step , in the proper order . But that didn't work . I would get no Internet connection and the cable modem would reset itself every 5 minutes . I read the reviews here and followed the suggestions . I updated the firmware . I rebooted the computer . I reset the cable modem . I rebooted the router . I repeated the above a bazillion times in different orders . But that didn't work . I swore . I whimpered . I threw a tantrum and promised to be good the rest of my life . But that never works . Finally , what eventually worked for me was : - I cloned the MAC address of my network card - I held in the reset button on the cable modem ( RCA ) for 20 seconds until all lights on the front panel were lit solid - I sacrificed a chicken - I cold booted the PC - I danced , I laughed , I rejoiced . It worked ! This may not work for your situation , but it 's worth a try . And hey , what 's one chicken more or less ?  
2	  I 'm very happy with the LX7 itself - it 's slim , looks good , has a smooth scroll action and quiet buttons , It fits neatly into the middle of my palm , which is how I usually use mice . The receiver , on the other hand , is a bit too ungainly larger than the typical USB thumb drive . The translucent plastic shows that there is quite a bit of empty space inside . It 's unfortunately a bit ungainly , especially compared to the amazingly tiny ones that Logitech ships with the more expensive mice these days . It would have been nice if it docked into the base of the mouse , like some of the Microsoft Notebook mice . Since this isn't explicitly advertised as a notebook mouse , I suppose it 's understandable . Overall , I 'm satisfied , especially for the price of my refurb unit .  
2	  Our T289s arrived from Amazon the day before we were to use them at a weekend trade show at the Santa Clara Convention Center . It ony took me part of one afternoon to learn all of the basics , and the rest of the weekend was ' learn-by-doing ' , with the help of the incredibly simple instruction manual . We caravaned down in two vehicles with a radio in each , and were able to find parking near one another , which expedited our move-in . Once we got into the event center , we saw dozens of this make and model of radio being used by the other conventioneers . During sales lulls , I occasionally played with the scan feature and in fact , during one of those passes , happened to hear a couple of friends of mine that I 'd been hoping were there ! ( The one small drawback over the weekend was that it was the last weekend in March of 2001 , and if you remember , there was a tremendous solar storm - this made the range of the radio somewhat limited , but did not hamper the sound quality nor the ease of use . However , since then , we have had no problems with establishing a long range between radios or finding a quiet frequency , even with the tremendous subspace chatter that is always present in the SF Bay Area . ) The T289 has already become a very neccesary part of our shopping expiditions , as it has streamlined the process of being able to keep up with one another without having to adjust to each other 's walking speed and / or shopping habits ! And yes , they are the COOLEST-looking gadgets around . If you 're going to invest in two-way FRS , go ahead and get the Talkabout 289 . It 's got all the features you will ever need , and it 's a very reliable little contraption . Heartily recommended !  
2	  compre esta camara y es exelente .. peque & ntilde ; a , tiene todo lo que necesito .. lo unico es q ' deberia de venir con una bolsa para guardarla .. espero que les esa util el comentario  
2	  Second D-Link product owned and I am very happy with it . So far , no problems . Ordered and shipped from Amazon within one week . Very pleased .  
1	  Length : 0:46 MinsLogitech has a known issue with this remote and other remotes . ( search online , " harmony remote back sticky " auto fills on google . Google requires several thousand searches before the query becomes a suggestion ) Something breaks down in the plastic and the back of the remote becomes sticky like its covered with goo .. See quick clip posted with this review . Logitechs solution , they sent me emails saying have it fixed by a third party , re-cover the back with plastic sheeting , buy a new remote from them at 10 % discount so its only 30 % more than you can buy it online . Will never buy another product from them . I have remotes that are 20 years old and the plastic shows no sign of degradation . Up your quality control logitech .  
2	  Brutally expensive in the bigger diameters , I got this 39mm for my 135mm Elmarit . Threads effortlessly and seems to work just fine . BTW if you wondered why I bothered with this I live in the mountains at 7,500 feet so I bought into the notion of the UV / IR cut . Coating seems great , haven't gotten it dirty enough to tell you if its any easier to clean then a standard filter .  
1	  I received a pair of Koss KSC75 earphones as a holiday gift ( from my wish list ! ) . I soon realized I need a case to protect the earpieces from snapping off and to keep the cord from getting tangled with all the other cords I have to carry . I must thank all of you who reviewed this case , since I learned from most of you that it 's rather large . I don't want it taking up too much space in my bag since I travel a lot and try to keep the bulk to a minimum . I looked at the smaller Koss case ( size " D " ) and a reviewer there said he had tried them for his KSC75s and that case is too small for them . Then I researched on Amazon and via Google for more than an hour , trying to find a case these would fit into but would not be unnecessarily large . So hard to tell ; often no dimensions are given . I found people posting picks of soap cases ( ! seriously ! a soap case by Mary Kay ! ) in which they were carrying their KSC75s , because * they * couldn't find a good case either . Then I just took a look around my house and found a Burberry sunglass case that fits these headphones perfectly . Done . So once again , thank you to all those who noted that this case is a bit too roomy for a pair of KSC75 earphones .  
1	  Do NOT buy this item ! I have never felt the need to write a bad review on a product .. The first one I got-the electric grid stopped working after a couple days . I took it back and exchanged for a second and the bulb burned out after about a month , replaced the bulb ( half as must as a whole new unit ) and then the electric grid on this one went out soon after . I never left it out in a strom . This product is junk !  
1	  I bought this to replace our HP psc 1200 which had given good service for many years . Our previous all-in-one always worked on any computer we installed the software in . The 5610 installs a huge software package . It screwed up the Fuji camera software I 'd been using . The HP software I had for my last printer could be interupted at any time ; I 'd pull the paper supply out , then cancel whatever I didn't want in the print queue . The software for the 5610 has a very hard time cancelling a document ; at the least it insists on wasting an extra sheet of paper . Worse , I now have a document that can't be cancelled at all and it 's got the computer completely frozen up . The paper feed is messed up and ruins documents especially when you 're using HP 's most expensive photo paper and ink . The photo printing quality is not great unless you use the very highest settings and then it is extremely slow ( think 30 minutes per picture ) and most likely to ruin your pictures by misfeeding or software glitches . This HP is garbage . Try a different brand .  
2	  At this price , who doesn't want one ! ? I got a whole bunch and gave it away to all my photographer friends !  
2	  I have Dell XPS 710 series maxed out for video and digital editing . HD 5.1 audio capability in my speakers is a must and these speakers are perfect . From thunderous base to shearing high pitch .. no problem . What is most impressive is there ability to crisply drive both ends at the same time allowing you to composit things like thunder and glass fragments hitting the ground . The wattage is nice when you simply want to feel that base move you !  
1	  Before you purchase this item you should know the following information available from the technical support section of the Linksys web site ( but not on the data sheet or user manual for the product ) : 1 . The WRE54G is ONLY compatible with products having WDS ( Wireless Distribution System ) support . Lynksys ( as of 01/20/06 ) only lists the following three products as compatible : WAP54G ( firmware version 2.07 or later ) WRT54G ( firmware version 2.02.2 or later ) WRT54GS ( firmware version 2.07.1 or later ) 2 . Wireless MAC filtering has no effect on clients connected through the WRE54G . There is no way to specify which MAC addresses can and cannot access the network when they are connecting through the WRE54G . 3 . If you do have MAC filtering enabled on your router or access point you must enter the MAC address of the WRE54G in the " permit " list for the expander to work . 4 . The range expander will reduce the transmit rate to approximately half of the original source data rate transmission . 5 . If your computer has a firewall such as Zone Alarm , you need to enter the expander 's IP address in the list of trusted IP addresses in the firewall in order to configure the WRE54G .  
1	  I should have read the reviews before purchasing it . Why would someone sell the item as a package when the package is not compatible ? I guess I now have a paper weight that is black and blue . How about thinking before selling !  
2	  Great headphones for price . Good sound . They were a little larger than expected and warm ears after a while of listening . I would recommend .  
1	  This is the worst disappointment to discover that the picture frame , unlike most that we could have bought instead simply does not work without " activating " it . That is , you stick in your memory card , but then nothing happens , unless you subscribe to a service over internet , phone , whatever . This way you could activate a card reader that you have already paid for . This was not at all our intention when we purchased this product as the package makes no mention of such " bundling " . Now I am stuck with a gift that was returned to us from a grandmother , who could not make it work . Neither could I. I will try returning it to where we bought it and do my best to warn others about this rip off .  
2	  This film is not for use in 35mm cameras . It can only be used for 24mm cameras . The product description did not give you this important information . You have to watch who the seller is . Never buy a product from the seller who has a very strict return policy . For instance , Photoworld will not allow you to return this product if you bought it by mistake ( if you read their return policy , almost nothing can be returned ) . Always buy things from Amazon or a reputable seller who has a decent return policy . Also , if you see that Amazon is the seller in the product list view , the seller may be switched to a different seller when you enter into the product page . You 'll need double check the seller when you place the order .  
2	  I have had the Nuvi for a few days now and from my experience so far , the unit does a great job for point to point Navigation . Although , it would have been nice if more manipulation were possible , there are certain options offered that could help to make the unit present a route which is acceptable . One of the primary reasons i bought this product was because of its compact size . Almost nothing else i have seen so far beats the Nuvi in terms of convenience when you are a travelling person . Which is where i have my big complaint , the unit i bought from Amazon had to be returned to them because the car charger ( DC convertor ) got stuck in the side of the Nuvi and refused to come off . This means every time i wanted to carry the nuvi with me , the car charger would accompany us . When i called Garmin i was told after a 50 minute wait that you are not supposed to connect the car charger to the side of the Nuvi , but instead it needs to be connected to the behind through the car mount . Although i found this hard to beleive , Garmin offered to help to free the charger from the USB Mini port . To avoid any complications i thought it best to return to Amazon and seek a replacement which they very promptly despatched to me . After receiving the unit i decided not to be too adventurous so i plugged in the DC car charger to the back of the car mount - and guess what ? Its stuck there permanently ! I yanked and tugged but to no avail ! The only good thing this time is that i can now take the Nuvi off the mount without the charger having to be lugged around . But if i do want the Car charger to be taken with me , then the cradle of the mount joins the merry family . How come no one else has had this problem ? I am surprised that there seems to be a defect with the Car charger plug-something that most certainly is a critical aspect-if you do have the charger stuck in the side of the nuvi , you cannot use the USB port for down loads etc and neither can use the AC wall charger to charge the unit as it plugs into the mini usb port as well ! Having said this , i need to point out that there is no problem with the Wall charger it slides in and out smoothly from the USB Mini port on the side of the Nuvi - wonder what Garmin will have to say about this ? Cannot afford another 50 minute wait to be told some other story !  
2	  Works great as expected . The Hi-Fi fits perfectly and no issues with sound using it in this case . Haven't taken it far , outside on the patio is about it , so I can't offer any opinions of travelling with it . I use it more as a protective case than a travelling bag . The 8GB 2nd gen nano I have fits through the case as well as the 80GB 5.5 gen video I have as well . The power cord fits through the opening in the back just as expected and there are a few pockets that I put the remote and 1 or 2 dock adapters in . So , if you 're looking for a nice case to keep the amazing Apple Hi-Fi safe and sound when you 're movin ' it around , I believe in the product here , you have found ! :)  
2	  Now that S-VHS blanks are no longer manufactured , it is near impossible to find an extended length S-VHS blank for a reasonable price from private parties or from any store 's inventory . While this D-VHS blank is not cheap , it provides even better quality ( because of its super fine grain ) and very extended recording time for both D-VHS and S-VHS recorders . Using the latter , you can fit a long movie at SP speed for excellent picture quality even by today 's digital standards . The longevity of this tape should also be excellent . In fact , I have plenty of DVD coasters now ( accumulated over the past 6 years ) but all of my S-VHS and D-VHS ( even regular VHS from ' 83 ) tapes still play well . Be that as it may , all videotape blanks will soon be extinct so grab them now if you need them .  
1	  I purchased two of these to use in my car and on the road to hook my MP3 player into a car stereo . They are of a very poor quality and make static whenever the cable is moved in any way . Cable move a lot in portable installation in moving vehicles . Thus , I 'm throwing both away as they aren't useful . If you were connecting two components that didn't move at all , this might be an OK cable , but personally , I would invest in a higher quality product .  
2	  I would recommend this keyboard to anyone who has Carpal Tunnel Syndrome or related wrist pain due to repetitive motion . 22 years ago , I had constant pain in my hands , wrists , and forearms from typing all day . Within 2 weeks of switching to this keyboard , 95 % of the pain was gone . It did not return until I spent 2 weeks recently typing on a traditional keyboard at my new job . I immediately ordered this keyboard for work and the pain is gone . The keyboard is split and angled , which puts your hands into a more natural position . It takes a few hours to get used to it , but you will not regret making the switch because your hands and wrists will feel so much better . I believe this keyboard kept me from having surgery on my wrists . Get it !  
2	  Very easy to use . Helpful instructions and simple recipes to get started make it very easy to use for first timers . Always make sure there 's enough liquid and you should be fine .  
2	  I have owned and used this cooker for several years . It is the perfect size for my 2 person household . Many empty nesters and those with small kitchens will find this a terrific product . The accessories make this pot multifunctional and expand its usefulness . There is : - a steamer basket - a glass lid - a strainer lid - which locks in place like the pressure cooking lid for draining hot liquid from pasta , veggies , etc . The locking capability of the strainer lid makes draining hot liqiuds very easy and safe . There are many books available for those unfamiliar to pressure cooking such asPressure Perfect : Two Hour Taste in Twenty Minutes Using Your Pressure Cookerand many others . The options are unlimited and so you are not stuck with only pot roast or stew . You can even bake cheesecake in the pressure cooker . Pick a book and get started ! The Presto website is another great resource with lots of recipes and tips . This cooker saves time , conserves energy ( propane in my case ) , and prevents loss of nutrients in food while giving delicious results . Do not let the stories of pressure cookers exploding from way back when frighten you . The newer cookers have safety features to prevent this . The Presto brand is very common across the country so the parts are widely available . The sealing ring must be replaced on all pressure cookers periodically no matter who the manufacturer is . Many hardware stores ( mom and pop as well as large chains ) carry thePresto Pressure Cooker Sealing Ring / Overpressure Plug Pack ( 4 & 6 Quart ) . An important consideration to make before purchase .  
2	  The Panasonic headset is comfortable , easy to use and has excellent sound . While not expensive , so far this headset is the best one I have owned and I would buy another without hesitation .  
2	  The internal LAN card in my laptop was going bad and I needed a quick fix . The Belikn card has performed so much better than the internal card that I am not going to replace it . I will continue to use the Belkin for my business demo 's .  
1	  First , the hardware . The Linksys WUSB54G wi-fi adapter comes in the form of a small box with a flip-up antenna . You hook the included USB cable ( A-B type ) to the adapter and to a USB port on your PC - high-speed USB 2 port preferred - and you can surf the web wirelessly . The adapter seems average in performance , in terms of speed and distance . ( I use it with a Linksys Wireless-G router . ) The signal strength seems to fluctuate quite wildly , even when you don't change any of the factors that might affect it . But overall , it works . Now comes a BIG warning : do NOT install the utility that came with the adapter . It has a confirmed serious memory leak problem . By this I mean that after running the utility ( which sits in the system tray ) for about an hour , it 'll have gobbled up anywhere between 300MB and 600MB ( or more ) of your system memory ! My desktop has 1GB and at one point the utility took over more than 580MB before I shut it down via the Task Manager . Unfortunately ( as another example of really bad software engineering ) , you can't quit the program for real . As long as you have the adapter active , the utility will come back to life and start eating up your memory again . If you have Windows XP , use the OS 's built-in " Windows Zero Configuration Wireless Client . " First , uninstall the Linksys utility if you already installed it . Second , you need to install the adapter 's driver : simply plug the adapter into a USB port , and , when Windows ' driver search dialog comes up , browse to the " Driver " folder on the Linksys CD-ROM ( e.g. , " D :\ driver " ) , and use the " v4 " ( version 4 ) driver , which is the latest - after that , Windows ' built-in wi-fi client will automatically kick in . Unfortunately , if you use Win2k or earlier , you 'll have to either live with the poorly written Linksys utility ( the problem exists on all systems ) and restart your PC periodically to reclaim the memory , or just return the whole thing as a defective product and get another adapter ( e.g. , Netgear ) .  
1	  This hardware is well-made and I have heard very good things about the non-bluetooth version of the mouse . When it 's connected and working , it does its job very well . Unfortuntately the MX5000 set suffers from some very poorly made software that makes it very difficult to use effectively . At seemingly random intervals , the mouse will start lagging or stop altogether . If this happens during gameplay , you 're in a bad way . The keyboard also suffers from a truly annoying bug . When it comes off of its sleep state , it will double the first key you press . I have also had the keyboard just reset out of the blue . Add in that the SetPoint software for the LCD screen only fully works with two pieces of software ( MusicMatch and Windows Messenger ) , and you have a very disappointing desktop package . The MX1000 is a great mouse on its own , but stay away from this Bluetooth combo . It is unstable and very frustrating to use .  
1	  It 's advertised as fitting all the different sizes of Franklin planners . Yes , it probably fits all the hole patterns , but in the Pocket size planner the Palm sticks out of the planner cover about a half inch . Not an ideal application . Plus the cost is a bit ridiculous ; fifteen bucks for this little piece of molded plastic ? Get real !  
1	  I bought this transmitter for my daughter 's birthday and it broke off in the cigarette lighter the first time it was used . It also blew the fuse . I would look for another brand with the same features .  
1	  I bought this remote to use with my 27 " Panasonic CRT TV in the bedroom . The OEM remote lost button functions over time-just like the previous , more expensive Sony RM-VL900 I bought to replace it . The same thing has happened to this remote ! I 'm beginning to wonder if the TV is somehow the cause of this recurring problem . The main channel Up-Down buttons no longer work , so one cannot scan channels . The individual channel and PIP button still work , but only one of the PIP scan buttons function . The only way to surf is to bring up the PIP window , use the lone PIP scan button , then punch in each channel one wants to watch . I have a Universal MX500 for the main TV , and have had no problems whatsoever with it . Of course , it cost well over $ 100 , and I just don't have that kind of $ nowadays . I 'll just have to hope I can find an inexpensive remote that will maintain button function for more than a few months !  
2	  Over all this product is very nice It does work as stated as long as you have a high speed conection . BUT check to see if it 's compatiable with your tv , cable box , fta receiver , etc . The on screen remote control that is used in the slingbox software did not support my equiptment . Although tech support was very fast to reach , and in enghish I must add they were very aware of incompatable remote issues . With no resolve . I had to search out a third party remote program to resolve my issue . But it did not control all the functions of my origanal remote but did the job .  
2	  Got these headphones because I don't like earbuds and most over the ear headphones don't work to well with glasses . These are definitely funny looking and the way they fold are very unique , but they fit really good with my glasses . They dont squeeze the temples and the sound is great . They arent Beats by Dre but they have some bang to them . When I go into class I just fold them up and stick them in my pocket , so they are very convenient .  
1	  I had an HP printer for years , never had a problem . I 've had this C-80 for 6 months now and it is nothing but trouble . Color rarely prints properly , 1-8 sheets of paper feed each time , the printer goes through ink like crazy , but it doesn't seem to end up where it is supposed to be on the paper . Bottom line : a complete piece of junk .  
2	  Item arrived exactly as described . Shipping was faster than anticipated . The price and quality make it a super value . I have tested the cable and it works great .  
2	  plug and play with vista . cheap . works . what more can you want .  
1	  I bought the Toshiba Pocket PC e740 on March 24 , 2003 from Shopharmony . com . I received it via UPS on April 1st , 2003 . My serial number begins with a " 2 " . When I received the PDA , it appeared to be working fine for one day , so I sent in the rebate ( big mistake ) . Right after I mailed it , guess what ? The PDA is now officially [ not working ] . THe screen would start flashing all over the place when I charged the PDA overnight , and I constantly saw " low battery " messages all over the place . Turning off WiFi did not help . My BIOS version is " 1.0604 .. " Now , if I remove my battery for any period of time , the data is lost . Completely . Hearing all the reports of faulty repairs by Toshiba , I would suppose that sending the PDA to the company would be a bad idea ( I already talked to the Recall center representatives ) . Now , I can't use the PDA properly , let alone CHARGE it . I can't return it to Shopharmony . com , since I already sent in the UPC code for the rebate . Am I officially [ out of luck ] ? Someone who is / knows a lawyer , please consider a small-case court against Toshiba , if this is feasible . The number of defective Toshiba e740s is staggering , all over the place . Toshiba will not honor a e750 exchange , neither will the place where I bought my PDA . According to the other posts , returning it to [ the store ] is useless , since they have to same exact problems . Is the Toshiba e740 model [ out of luck ] ? ( it probably is ) . Toshiba has removed the e740 from their website , and even the recall information .  
2	  I 've bought 2 times the same product , and I 'm very happy with this SD . Used on a SLR Digital Camera , is fast and reliable . I recommend .  
2	  I can connect my TV to my laptop easily with this cord ! The sound and picture are great . Also , I can keep my laptop close so I can easily change the video .  
1	  My recommendation is that you shouldn't buy any modem with the name Conexant . This was my fourth Conexant modem , and it was just like all the others . It turns out that all Conexant modems are software based , which means that they put most of their workload on the CPU . This results in frequent crashes , slow connections , and most commonly , frequent disconnects . I hope you take this advice and buy something more reliable , such as Best Data or US Robotics .  
2	  Awesome little camera-just don't depend on it for capturing great 4 megapixel shots you can print out in poster size color . It 's a small camera and so is the resolution . What it 's perfect for is capturing moments that would otherwise go unrecorded because you didn't want to lug a mid-sized ( or even compact ) camera around . This thing is TINY . The downside is that it 's easy to lose pics if the battery drains and it 's even easier to get a blurry shot if you 've got a shaky hand . Patience when shooting in good light and a careful eye on the battery meter are needed . Though I only got about 50 shots with the included battery , I have taken well over a hundred with the Energizer I popped in and it 's still going .  
2	  Great for traveling . I throw this in my backpack and take it everywhere . I use this with my iPad along with a small , thin , Bluetooth keyboard . I love this product .  
2	  I bought one of these drives for our facility and its great ! Fast access times , plug and play , runs like a champ . We haverun DV compressed video on these drives and never had a droppedframe . I want to stack 13 of these drives and have a fullterrabyte .  
2	  I cant beleive what I paid for these speakers , they blow away all the other sets that I 've heard ( except for Klipsch ) . The subwoofer has tight DEEP bass , excellent 8 " driver . One of the best features is the headphone jack , its right on one of the satellites , I never thought that I would care less about that , but it has become one of the most handiest things ( I have a baby , and sometimes need to keep it quiet ) . Volume is not a problem with these speakers either . One shortfall is the MINOR lack of midrange , which can be fixed with software , but nevertheless should be mentioned . BUY THESE NOW ! If your in the market for 2.1 speakers , don't bother hesitating . Get em !  
2	  This was my first PDA purchase and after much soul searching I settled for the Windows Mobile PC platform . I am certain that I made the right choice despite the comments by those who believe that Windows Mobile has a long way to go aginst Palm OS . The choice fell between Toshiba e355 and iPaq 1935 both selling for $ 199.00 . I opted for Toshiba e355 since iPaq was offering a measly 90 day warranty ! Granted iPaq 1935 is perhaps more compact and smaller than Toshiba e355 but the performance of Toshiba rocks and I have no regrets . Both my PDA and Windows Mobile 2003 have worked flawlessly and has been very stable till now ! I do not know why everyone is complaining of absence of CF card slot when price differential between CF card and SD card has narrowed considerably . I got a SanDisk 256 Mb SD card for 59.00 after rebates only slightly more expensive compared to comparable CF Cards ! What can I say about Toshiba e355 ? Performance is impeccable . Very stable and so far reliable . I have added a few software , FlexWallet and ACDSee Mobile and both work flawlessly ! I have transferred my address book from Outlook and few other data including several photo images from my desktop using Active Sync and everything is working well . The only complaint I have is about the non removable battery . However I am fairly certain that in about three years time , I will be upgrading this PDA and I am not overly concerned about the battery replacement issue ! I have no hesitation in recommending Toshiba e355 to those who are looking for a base level PDA but do not intend to carry it in their shirt pockets ( iPaq 1935 is more appropriate ! ) Have fun using Toshiba e355 !  
2	  In searching for a HDTV , I was limited to a 37 " width constraint by my existing entertainment center . After researching the qualities of LCD , DLP , and plasma , I decided plasma was the way to go and this one at 36 " wide was a good fit . The only problem was with the H configuration of the table top stand . In order to flush mount the display with the front of the entertainment center , the front legs of the stand had to be cut back 5 " to keep them from protruding . We are extremely pleased with the quality of the almost 3-D pictures and I am most pleased at how easy it was for my technically challenged wife to master the remote . I highly recommend it .  
1	  I think these were made for a walkman that sits at your waste or inside a bag . I CAN'T STAND the asymetrical wires . Why is one side longer than the other ? Someone mentioned that they were that way so that people with remotes could use them . Why does the apple store even carry these things ? The sound is the only reedeming quality . The buds are comfy but the cord keeps whacking me in the face when I run . Bottom line : it shouldn't be that hard to wear , run , and store them ( the storage box is too small ) . I 'm taking these back to where they came from !  
2	  I was thinking of getting a UV protection filter after I got my first DSL camera Nikon D90 . I did much research on the numerous filters and found that they are sitting from just 5 bucks and even up to 60 bucks . I doubted if this such little thing really dose something with the DLS . Finally I chose B + W for my camera because its amazing reviews made me feel it is worthy for every penny . After I put it on D90 , WOO , I was impressive by its solid appearance . Now , I shoot with my D90 without noticing anything in the front of it . I cannot find any differences .  
2	  It does not always eject well with U3 installed . I have removed it and it is working well . Also I do not like how the light will sometimes stay on after ejection . Other than that it is a great product . Very durable and plenty of space .  
1	  After less than two years of service my Beltronics V955 stopped working . I contacted Beltronics and was charged $ 59.95 to repair the unit . It came back to me saying the power switch was replaced . I did get the same unit back that I had sent in . Though I am content with the radar detector 's performance I feel that I was forced to pay too much for repairs too soon after purchasing the item . It is not a cheap instrument . I paid aprox $ 150 + for it and could not afford to replace it when it broke . I think Beltronics should be more reasonable with repairs that are not the fault of the owner . It was not a question of any type of misuse created the power switch breakdown . For this reason I will not purcahse another Beltronics device .

2	  Allows me to use my device without all the extra cables ! Have had no problems with it .  
1	  Unfortunately , after several ( 5 + ) hours of working with this device , I haveto proclaim it a disappointment . Installing the hardware itself went fine . However , when I attempted to install the drivers for this device , Windows ( 98 in this case ) went nuts . It turns out that the drivers on the floppy disk DO NOT include necessary files .. However , even when I use those drivers and reboot , my machine STILL doesn't detect the network card . Windows itself claims it 's there , but ipconfig ( in DOS ) and winipcfg can't find it . I 've checked BIOS to make sure the PCI slot is enabled - it is . Additionally , the driver installation freaks out because it can't find easy-to-locate Windows-related files ( ftp . exe , networks , etc . ) . I imagine the installer is looking in the wrong directories ; I point it manually toward the correct directory and the installer continues . After checking D-Link 's troubleshooting documentation , I 'm out of ideas , and running out of patience . Most likely I 'll return this to the store or buy a different brand of card .  
1	  The package did not appear to have been damaged , but the end cap was cracked and it cannot be used . Unfortunately , the time to return has expired . I don't know if I can find parts . I don't want to have to buy another one .  
2	  I use these at work at the time . They are compatible with all of the PDAs , cameras and laptops we test and make transferring data very easy . I use them very heavily and have about a dozen on my desk at any one time and I haven't had one go bad yet .  
2	  I purchased this for my daughter and she says it does everything she needs and fit perfectly in the spot on her desk .  
2	  I bought this to use with my Canon Rebel XTi . It works great . Every time I push the button , my camera takes the picture . Even in strong lighting , I have had no issues with the camera sensing the remote . It is small and lightweight , so it hangs nicely on the camera strap without being obvious or bulky . It has the ability to immediately take the picture or take the picture on a delay so that you have time to hide the remote when you jump in the picture yourself . I have had it for 2 months and use it all the time and the battery is still going strong .  
1	  My Pioneer PD-F1009 CD player has great sound . However , the random play does not function right . I have many CDs and songs loaded , and there is a core group of maybe about 20 ( out of more than 500 ) songs that , on random play , are played much more often that is possible in a truly random programming . Before buying the F1009 I had the PD-F407 , and it had the same problem .  
1	  I was a HP printer fan until I purchased the 7140xi . I purchased it because it came with a print server & networking capabilities for my home LAN . After 40-50 hours on the phone with HP Support ; calling friends for technical support , weeks of frustration , and many installs / uninstalls later-the HP printer is being returned . I could not get the HP software to install on my desktop with Windows XP-Home . I was able to install the HP Director software on 1 Windows 2000 laptop but not on another W2K laptop . My advice : consider another multifunction . I just ordered a Canon Multipass 730 & have given up on a networked multifunction for my home LAN .  
1	  This might have been a great cable if only it fit into the slot on the Canon i320 bubblejet printer I bought from Amazon . com . My objection is : why did Amazon . com recommend this cable when I purchased my printer ? It 's so misleading and totally betrayed my trust in Amazon . com . I waited the whole week till I have time on the weekend to unpack my packages and print some photos-now I 'll have to go cable shopping instead !  
1	  It seems to work ok , but the peg in the back of the wall-mount isn't far enough down . It makes the bottom of the plug stick out so it isn't flush with the wall . I will have to see if my husband can remove that when he gets home . Otherwise , it works just fine .  
2	  This splitter was a breeze to use . So much easier than a 4-way splitter . Fewer connections . Makes the cable jumble look organized .  
2	  This is a decent product . Easy to put together even for a senior female like me . Holds almost as many DVDs as it claims . Would get more .  
2	  I don't have much to compare them to as I haven't bought much besides these as far as headphones go . But it 's pretty decent . Sometimes I don't like the sound separation between music and voice ( speaking , singing / instruments ) . I was rapping for about a year and I mostly used these for my home studio . Honestly it wasn't SUPER great , but it was ok for $ 50 . I still use them for regular listening and they aren't bad . Probably a lot better stuff out there for more money though .  
1	  NO STARS for this product - it is very uncomfortable to wear the ear pieces ( plugs ) are painful , it is heavy and slips off my head , when I try to grab it from slipping I naturally put my hands on the outer ear pieces which screws up all the digital buttons and the reception is fair . There wasn't a 0 Star to choose .  
2	  We Love this product . We needed it to go 60ft inside a metal building and hook up to the internet . It has worked perfectly . It is a very well made product and felt that the price was not out of line compared to some others we had looked at . We highly recommend it .  
1	  Slingbox is a cool concept but there are still issues with framerate loss while changing channels on the AV model . While this might be acceptable if you don't change the channel much it was very annoying in our household ! I returned it and will probably just get a small LCD TV - you can nevery have enought screens :)  
1	  The device is unstable , and SanDisk support is incompetent . I 've gone through the RMA process with them about 7 times now . I would have loved to give up and get a refund from Amazon after the second new unit failed to work properly , but SanDisk took so long with the first RMA that I ended up outside the 30 day return for a full refund window . I am still playing the RMA tango with them 3 and a half months later .  
1	  i waited for a long periods for sony to develop xp drivers for pcg-f680 notebook i purchased in 2000 . the installation of xp was smooth and i was working without sony laptop drivers and working fine till i loaded sp2 . the laptop just freezes at random , more on click or scrollbar activities . even with the new sony drivers for xp , the sp2 still behaves the same . is it microsoft or sony ? it seems like i read complaints about sony 's other models facing the same issue . what " lies " beneath these problems ? - sony migration path to newer OSs is a big hassle . never buy sony from that angle .  
2	  I work in a busy studio / warehouse .. no cubicles , just one big space with no walls between desks . These headphones work great .. never knew how productive I could be without all the sound / talk distractions . I know they aren't high end , but they work and are comfortable enough for me to wear for long periods of time . I wear glasses as I work , so the smaller cuffed pads don't press my frames against me head . I actually tried the in-store demo of a couple of the $ 150 to $ 200 Bose noise cancelling headphones . I don't know what the big deal is as I could hear the conversation on the next aisle as the music played . Comparable to those , it seems the same and even better to me for a fraction of the price . My best investment so far this year . The fact that they 're not foldable makes them less " clumsily " put on .  
2	  I ordered this with the camera and was surprised as just how handy it is . The small carabiner on the back makes it easy to attach to a belt loop and the velcro / zipper close also makes it easy to grab those shots you normally miss . It 's especially handy when hiking with a pack or kid on your back .  
1	  these headphone had a horrible sound and no bass and not comfortable in the ear . But what did i expect for 7.99 .  
1	  This cooler is huge . I bought one of these , but it didn't fit inside my PC case . What good is a CPU cooler if it if it doesn't fit inside your PC ? In all fairness , it does have a copper base for better heat transfer and neat-o looking tubes coming out of the base , and due to its size , I 'm sure it cools well . Unfortunately , I couldn't use it due to its size .  
2	  I purchased this bag from amazon in a bit of a rush . However , I sure made out well . This bag has a TON of storage for how cheap it was . I am new to photography , but this bag makes me feel like a pro . I currently keep my T2i , 18-55mm lens , charging cord , cleaning pen , 2 lens filters , a cleaning cloths , a 60 " tripod , and two batteries in this bag . I could fit probably 2-3 MORE lens ' in the compartments . I will be getting another soon , so I will update then . I took it on vacation with me , and I am convinced that I could not have found a better bag . It looks like a simple backpack , so you don't stand out in a crowd . The rib / dividers have a surprising amount of strength while still being very soft . I can't get over how wonderful this bag is . It has an elastic string webbing to carry a " light jacket " but I cannot comment on that . A front zipper pocket with nothing in it is also there ( This is where I keep my batteries for quick switches , but I also put my ipod , and tons of other stuff in there . ) It has 3 ( very soft ) SD card holders with velcro flaps , two open compartments with elastic bands around the top ( These are where I keep my cleaning pen , and filters . ) It has a few exterior rings to hold a tripod . I hand mine off of the side with one loop . All exterior loops seem reinforced , but time will tell . It has a chest and a waist strap , but I removed them , which was very simple . However , my absolute favorite parts of this bag are the two side velcro pockets . I keep my phone in one , and my wallet in the other . so handy !  
2	  We loved the fact that the power button couldn't get accidentally hit draining the batteries when the USB device was plugged into the back of the mouse . My wife uses this mouse with our bed , her leg , the couch , or a pillow as her mouse pad . Works perfectly .  
2	  Sure , it 's over-priced , but so are most of Apple 's toys . This nifty little device fits snugly into the bottom of your iPod and transmits to most non-music stations on your car radio , boat radio or home radio . There can be some static , so it takes a bit of moving around to find the perfect reception . Mine works fine in the glove compartment of my car or sitting on top of my home receiver . It sure beats having an adapter to deal with and you can carry it out of your car for safe keeping .  
2	  I 've spent some time working overseas during the years , and the power grids are not always reliable . We occassionally see power spikes and brownouts from day to day that can cause serious damage to electronic equipment . I purchased the Tripp Lite TRAVELERC6 Protect It ! Surge Protector / Suppressor after a spike nearly took out my laptop computer . I spent days getting the computer going again after the lights suddenly flickered several times one night and then went off completely . This Tripp Lite unit is easy to use , just plug it in between the cord and the power supply and forget it . A green light indicates that it 's working and I 've noticed no difference in the way my computer operates . Thankfully there hasn't been another situation where the unit would be tested ( that I 'm aware of ) , but hopefully I 'm ready for the next power surge . This surge protector comes in a two pin and three pin model , so be sure to purchase the correct unit for your own computer if the need should arise . Please rate this review if you found it helpful .  
2	  I just bought one of these from Best Buy , and the cd had both XP and Max software on it . The software is kind of ghetto looking , and the " Upload completely ! " message indicates that there was obviously not much software quality control , but it works . The only thing , if you unplug the keychain while the software is up , and you forgot a picture so you replug it in while the software is still open , the download will not work . You will have to close the software and reopen it once you have reconnected and selected " usb update " . I got this as a gift for my fiancee 's mother , so I hope it 'll hold out until Xmas ( 8 days to go ) . Will update if I find a problem with it . Otherwise , everything is working and the pictures uploaded fine . Also cheaper and less bulky looking than the ones at Sharper Image and Brookstone ( probably less quality with this one , but my mother-in-law to be is scared of technology , so if she doesn't use it $ 30 is much less to be upset over than $ 60 ) .  
2	  Besides the obvious stuff - plays CD / CD-R / CD-RWs with mp3s or wma files on them , very good FM reception , good AM reception , a boatload of presets for both - this radio has one feature universally ignored by car manufacturers : a line-level input . " iPlug " is just a fancy name for a stereo minijack input on a surface-mountable pod . Awesome . The sound quality was a bit uneven at first , but with the right combination of loudness , EQ & sound profiles built-in , it sounds great . And yes , this thing can pump out some decent bass . Will it vibrate the fillings out of your teeth , vibrate your tag , make your trunk sound like two midgets wrasslin ' aluminim cans in a bag ? No . Sorry , OutKast . Does it sound better than the stock headunit ? Yes . The display is very bright , clear , easy to read and navigate . Few things anger me as much as having to use buttons to change the volume on the radio . Thankfully , this one has a big honkin ' knob you may twiddle and twist to your heart 's content . It also has mute and pause buttons , both of which are a godsend . Did I mention this thing was bright ? Holy crap , is it ever . The six buttons on the right side radiate enough blue light to be visible from the moon . On one hand , it 's great mood lighting when driving at night . On the other hand , the display isn't just visible in direct sunlight - it 's a wonder the sun is visible when the radio is on . There 's no dimmer , so you 'll have to live with it . I 've taken several extended drives at night with this and it doesn't bother me at all . Installation was a breeze with a wiring harness for my car . It took all of fifteen minutes while sitting in the driver 's seat . Looking for a decent radio to replace the stock head unit ? You 'd be hard pressed to do much better than this . ( ps - did I mention the display was bright ? )  
1	  1 . Setup was a pain . It 's connected to my router , but , got a wrong IP address which seemed to have been known for a while per the website of the manufacturer . ( why don't they do something about it ! ) . 2 . Technical support is useless . I talked to a couple of folks in Philipines ( nothing personal to the country ) , but , they 're just interested in log in collecting my personal information without providing any value-added technical solutions . Typical cheap call center . I felt like talking to a wall and listened to a recorded information . 3 . The range and the speed are not good at all ! 4 . I don't recommend at all .  
1	  This just didn't work . It 's supposed to be a dimmer switch but when I tried to dim the lights , it only put out a horrible humm and the lights went out completely . I sent an email to the company and got no response .  
2	  These headphones are a terrific bargain . I looked thru the selection at Best Buy , then I came back to amazon . The sound quality is excellent . The head band is adjustable . The headphones stay on my head , even when I 'm laying in bed . Highly recommend .  
2	  The cable works great with my iphone 5 . The length is several inches longer than the Apple supplied cable which is great because the apple cable is too short . The lightning connector is about the same size as the Apple cable . It 's sometimes a bit tight in the connection but I 'd rather have that then have it loose and coming out unexpectedly .  
2	  This is my second set of ety 's , unfortunately I lost the first . However , I couldn't imagine listening through " regular " headphones so I bought another pair . I fly a lot for work and after debating ety 's or the noise cancelling Bose , my audiophile friend said there was no comparison . The joy of flying on the plane with no engine noise is unbeatable and makes for a much better flight . Sound is crisp and sharp , like a symphony playing in your head . Yes , it actually sounds like the whatever you are listening to is coming from your skull . It may seem expensive to drop over $ 100 for ear buds in lieu of cans , but you won't regret it , these are worth every penny .  
1	  I Have these wonderful headphones and I use the foam buds because none of the rubber ones fit my ears . That said , you have to replace the foam ones every month or two depending how gross you can stand them and at 40 for a measly 5 pairs : that 's a total rip-off .  
2	  I debated wether or not to buy a small USB stick of 64gig or a new Ducati .. this memory stick won over !  
1	  I bought mine last month and used it for 10 times and now it doesnt work anymore . I went to a review board and 50 % people have the same problems . So stay away from this , if you dont want to loose data .  
2	  This radio & speaker system had all the features I wanted for my son 's Ipod . It sits on his nightstand and delivers good sound throughout his room .  
1	  It 's tiny and cute only when it is working . Mine died on the first battery , about 4-hour usage .  
1	  Purchased this recorder in September 2007 ; used on week-ends , infrequently . Stopped playing in March 2008 ; mailed to Samsung repair in New Jersey ; returned after delays due to not having part in stock . After receiving it back , used a couple of times when it stopped playing again . Disappointed in Samsung quality ; won't buy another product from them .  
2	  I ordered these as a high pass filter for car speakers to protect them from excessive bass and bottoming out , they did what I needed . The parts were delivered quickly and at a reasonable price  
2	  I have a Nikon D40x , with the 18-55mm lens and also the 70-300mm VR lens , which is just monstrous . However , even so .. the lens can remain attached to the camera to fit nicely back in the bag ( although it wouldn't fit with the lens hood on ) . I got this bag for travel with my camera , and one of the reviews I read before getting this bag was to get the Slingshot 200 instead of the Slingshot 100 ( what I 'd initially considered ) . EXCELLENT piece of advice ! The 200 isn't as big as you 're probably afraid it will be , and I can carry both my lenses ; the lens hood ; and the rubber Giottos air blower to clean the lenses . As an aside , if you 're swapping lenses out fairly frequently , it 's a must to carry the blower with you .. otherwise you 'll wind up seeing flecks in your viewfinder and have no way to get them out . Therefore , the bag you get also has to be able to accommodate a blower . I will tell you that both the hood and the blower are snug fits in two of the compartments , but I still have the 4th compartment empty . If the lenses you use are more in number or longer than what I 've described here , you 'll probably want to go with the 300 . There is a nice memory card holder on the inside flap ; and the all-weather covering is stealthily hidden on the backside . The bag has much more padding for your back than I expected ; and the foam compartments inside the bag are sturdier than I would have thought . The top zippered area on the back of the bag is not quite as useful as it maybe could be , but still a good , safe place to throw keys , and / or a 20-oz bottle , and a manual too . The bottom zippered pocket is great for storing an extra battery , the Nikon lens pen , filters , and other smaller items . My tripod doesn't fit in either slot on the outside of the bag , but a monopod would fit there . All in all , I would highly recommend this bag . I was very pleasantly surprised with the design and construction .  
1	  I bought 2 of these 4GB sd cards . I opened up the package and immediately placed the cards in the reader . One of them worked fine , the other was DOA . I placed the card in my reader and it told me that the card needed to be formatted and that it has a capacity of 32MB ! I emailed the seller that I wanted a replacement card sent to me and once I received the card I would send them back the defective one . I got an email stating that I must return the card for them to test , and if they found it defective then they would send me a replacement if one was available ! You do get what you pay for . BAD BUSINESS ! STAY AWAY !  
1	  This Que drive was a big waste of money . It frequently locks up my PC while making more noise than a blender chopping ice . After several tries , I finally managed to contact someone at QPS , and was told that some drives are just noisier than others . I will never make the mistake of purchasing another item from QPS . I am sorry that I can't rate this item lower than one star !  
2	  This little device works great in my 2006 Altima . I haven't had any problems with it and would get another one if this one gets broken or stolen .  
2	  HP 02 Black Printer Cartridge ( C8721WN ) . This is a GREAT product , and it costs much less than the HP original cartridges . I had doubts about it 's quality , because it was a compatible vs . original HP product . It works fine , and I recommend these cartridges to anyone trying to save just a bit of money on inkjet cartridges .  
2	  I bought this remote to use for long exposures with my D60 . It has one button which does exactly what you 'd expect - opens and / or closes the shutter . Two minutes after I opened the package I was taking my first test shots , and that was only because I had to find the right settings on my camera . As some other reviews have pointed out , the remote has to be in line of sight with your camera 's sensor in order to work , but that is no great inconvenience for my needs .  
2	  Easy to set up . I do not have a cable box and normally just plug in the cable right into my television . This is the only slingbox right now that allows you to plug in your cable directly without a cablebox . I bought it to watch the NCAA tourney while I was overseas in India . Despite the low bandwidth in India I was able to watch without any problem . My friend who lives in Dubai also used my code to watch my slingbox and had great reviews . Excellent product especially for the sports fan .  
1	  When I read the previous review about this thing skipping , I didn't pay too much attention because I intended to keep it on my kitchen counter . However , it skips while anyone walks anywhere near it . This is the most amazingly unstable CD player I 've ever seen . The best I can say for it is that with the right peripherals , it could be a nifty seismograph .  
2	  I have a G5 iMac at home running 10.4.11 that has a bad network adapter . I downloaded the drivers from startech . com , ran the installer package , rebooted , plugged it in and it worked great . I guess they 've resolved the issue that the previous reviewer had . BTW , don't ever install drivers that come packed with a product like this . There are usually newer ones available from the manufacturer 's website .  
1	  I bought this product right when it came out . I took the risk because it had every feature I was looking for and more . The Skyfi3 is easy to use in the home and on the road , and up to snuff as a portable device with the added accessories . The problem is .. well there are many . The device often freezes when trying to boot up . The internal memory that stores your recorded XM content becomes corrupted on a regular basis . Sometimes the device doesn't know how to recognize the car dock and freezes up . Sometimes the screen doesn't even display any information even though sound is being pumped to your speakers . Too bad .  
2	  This works ! It removed smears that an alchohol cleaning was only able to dissolve and spread evenly over my lens . This pen removed all residue and left my lens spotless .. it 's really amazing .  
2	  I have had a huge number of backpacks over the years , and one thing I can ; t stand anymore is a cheep one . This is one of the most rugged and stylish I have had . I think that this even beats Tumi bags . ( My previous bag was a Tumi which gave out in the zipper when I stuffed it full ) I particularly like this bag because of it 's heavy duty zippers for the large pockets , the metal reinforced top handle and it 's decent size and exapandability . This is a very rugged pack with lots of pockets . Two large ones with part of one of those with a padded slot with strap for your laptop . A top pocket for your MP3 Player and headphones . Lot 's of small pockets and places for your pens . It 's also padded nicely on the back , and has shock absorbing straps . Note this bag also comes in black , which I would have preferred , ( it 's just more professional looking ) but the red is nice too .  
1	  This product cost cheap becuase it is horrible . You 're better off throwing away $ 4 then buying this cable . I bought it to connect it to my tv and micro hdmi adaptor and connect it to my phone , the videos cut in and out and there is some static and white spots on the tv screen , I 've used this adaptor with other hdmi cabes and it works great , so I knew it wasn't my adaptor , also the video look dark with this cable . I tried connecting the cable to my cable box and my tv and the cable quality on my LG tv looked dark and horrible , again with the cable that came with my cable box , my cable looks great .. please don't waste your time buying from this company again . There is no rating for zero thats why I gave it a one , but my rating really is zero .. PURE TRASH !  
1	  This did not work because its for i-pod ? I needed it for a small dvd player to hook to a big tv . Cost more to ship back then its worth . The " quality " of the product gets a 10 , even if it won't work for me . I recomend this companys products ..  
1	  Do not buy one of these you will be wasting your money . You will also be taking them back if you buy them . I had mine for 10 days and within a few days i was unsatisfied the battery does not hold 20 hours of charge it holds more like 6-7 . Then on day 10 after my purchase the ipod wont turn on at all . So all I can say is what a waste of 300 dollars . Also like all these other reviews said they get scratched beyond recognitionSo save your money and stay clear maybe apple will get it right one of these days  
2	  If you are looking for a convienant way to organize your Music , Movies and Pictures the 80 gigabyte iPod is a must have . It has enough memory to hold all the songs you will need to complete your personal soundtrack as you go through out your day . And during those down times when you need something else to watch rather than your own life , you can select from a variety of movies that you can load and unload from your iPod . And when you are stuck with a stranger and have nothing to talk about , your picture library can help you brag how cool your life is and helps explain how popular you have become . It is slim and small so it can fit in your pocket without a bulge and it is light so it isn't a burden to carry it around . I have had my iPod for a few months now and love it !  
1	  Major issues include very delayed response and reception . Connection with satellite takes for ever and seems lost many a times . Connection drops out at the drop of a hat . A bit of cloud cover and there goes the connection . A few trees overhead and it loses it . What 's with the 4 and 5 stars ? Ridiculous !  
2	  What can I say . It performs as advertised . I 'm able to connect my digital camera to a power outlet and avoid draining the batteries while I upload my pics to the computer . Not very romantic , but functional .  
1	  I bought this product at a major chain office supply store . Tried to install it but was unsuccessful . Reason being 2 of the 4 bolts that hold the monitor to the mount broke . Went to the local hardware store and bought more of the same bolts . Finally hung the monitor on the wall and the mount sagged . Tried to tighten the mount so the monitor would stay level . This time a major hex bolt broke . The product is made of inferior metal and is very difficult to be useful . I tried to contact the company who made this product since it comes with a 10 year warranty . The company is no longer in business . I would not buy again nor would I recommend to others .  
1	  This is a nice looking compact device , but that 's where the benefits end . I had this thing for about two months and it worked flawlessly until it died . I unplugged , replugged , unplugged yet again and nothin ' . The modem to which it was attached was also powercycled and when connected directly to a PC it worked fine . Not only was the wireless portion dead but the wired connections were dead as well . The useless Netgear just sat there with some of its LEDs running except for the one with the everything's-OK-checkmark . I tried contacting Netgear 's tech support department but they charge $ 33 for a support call . How nice of them : release s ( * $ t that doesn't work right then charge people $ 33 for repair . Nice way to encourage people to never buy your products again . POS . Why the hell does something like this break ? It has no moving parts and is even plugged into a UPS device . Needless to say this wireless router met my concrete floor at a high rate of speed and I 'm about to go out and buy another model from a different company .  
2	  So this device has a number of really useful features packed into a great portable device . I can # t really say whether the quality will last the test of time . I 've had it for 2 months now . Initially there were some glitches with sound , these were fixed by a software update , and I haven't had too manhy issues since . Generally the device works well . It exposes multiple features in a usable fashion . The navigation menu 's and overall usability of the device isn't very user friendly . It 's not as intuitive to use as some other players on the market . However all the features are there and more . Try and think of a portable device that can surf 95 % of web pages and truly supports flash content . 99 % of pda 's can't boast that . It has a number of extra " soft " features such as wireless streaming from a computer through the player . If you really want to fully feel the force of the player , you will need to purchase the extra plugins and the dvr station . For around $ 75 the dvr station does a really good job for the price ! It 's not much more than ipod video out cables and it allows this plus much more . Make recordings of any program , stream content from a desktop pc through the player and dvr onto your tv with ease . Surf the web on your TV and watch youtube and google videos through it . This is one of the most amazing things , and the quality isn't too bad , especially with youtube videos ! I 'll need more time to see whether the device continues to perform well to judge whether it will last . It 's not the sort of portable you 'd want to take on a short road / rail / bus trip as it 's not as portable as a simple mp3 player and is more purposeful as a video player . You are likely to use it more as a portable video on long haul journeys , and in this class it performs great . My one major gripe with the product is the lack of tv tuner thus relying on the digital cable boxes to perform the tuning and making channel control difficult ( although the feature is available it doesn't seem to work with my setup ) . This means if I want to record 2 seperate programs on 2 seperate channels I 'd need to manually switch channels . Not the optimum thing to do when recording overnight . A little trick around this would be to use the cable auto program tuning features if you have such available to force the cable box to autotune to the different channels for recording . This should work but is definitely annoying and unwelcome . All in all great device , does what it says and performs reasonable well at it .  
2	  I bought the Protron 37 " Dual Tuner LCD HDTV back in September of 2006 and it still has an incredible HD picture . I have never had a problem so I have never had to deal with their customer service . I use our cable remote but the original still works and the sound and clarity are great and I love my tv , to this very day and it is used daily .  
2	  If you like to listen to music through your iPhone and your vehicle does not have an auxiliary jack ( but does have a cassette deck ) , then this is the adapter you need ! I drive a 2004 GMC Yukon with the factory stereo and Bose sound system , and I 've thought about getting an auxiliary input installed , but I always talk myself out of it since this cassette adapter provides high quality sound output from my iPhone at such a low cost . I 've tried other adapters such as theMonster iCarPlayandGriffin Direct Deck , but the Philips provides the closest thing to CD quality sound . The other two always sounded as if there was some kind of filter on them , and the sound was softer and of lower quality . I will say though that I tried a friend 's iPod through the Monster , and it sounded much better , so there may be some kind of compatibility issue with the iPhone . The only issue I have with the Philips adapter is that the tape does seem to wear out after 6 to 8 months , so I have gone through a few of them . But at only around $ 10 a pop , it 's well worth it ! To sum it all up , if you have a cassette deck and no auxiliary in your vehicle and listen to music through an iPhone , this is your best bet . The sound quality you get out of this adapter will surpass any FM transmitter and many other cassette adapters .  
1	  I would not buy this if you are looking for a belt clip when you exercise . It came with no directions on how to put on the skin or the belt clip . There is no protector for the screen if it falls . Belt clip fell off first time when I went to use it . ( Never able to use again since it was white and I was snowshoeing ) . I am looking into other products that Sansa recommends for thisplayer . The skin is fine for just sitting and listening to player .  
1	  I bought this CD player when looking for a way to play radio programs I burn to a CD as MP3 's . It would be perfect for that , but for some strange reason , the first one of these I bought began losing power . It would just shut off for no reason , and it was definitely some kind of power loss because I had to reset the volume and navigate back to the track after hitting Play again . I contacted customer support and I would have to send the unit in for diagnosis . There are costs involved in all that and I figured that since the price I originally paid for this model ( $ 99 ) had dropped to $ 59 , I might as well just replace it . So I bought a new one of the same model and the power fails on it , too ! This is with fresh batteries or even with a power adapter . I cannot figure it out . I even replaced the cassette adapter I use in my car and the power still dies . When you 're listening to a talk MP3 that 's 40 minutes long , having the power fail at 36 minutes is very annoying because the fast-forward function doesn't work well at all . You have to hold down the fast-forward for about 20 seconds just to advance one minute . A time skip feature would be more useful . Hit the Skip button and jump ahead one minute . Hold it down and jump ahead three minutes per second . I 've decided to return the D-NE510 and I 'm going to pay more for the NE710 model . If that oen also fails , I 'm going to abandon the Sony brand altogether .  
2	  I purchased it for my stereo at home to listen my ipod . Does it well . Why buy docking stations ? You home theater and this cable should be all you need to get great sound  
2	  Um1 's are good , but the dual driver um2 's have the perfect amount of " uumph " I need for performing . Clarity is great , and I see they have a new gel tips . Mine are a few years old with the foam tips . They get oily and wear out , but overall , these are the best for the price . Only way someone wouldn't like these are if the universal fit doesn't fit their unique ears  
1	  I use a Sony RZ Pentium 4 2.80 GHz with a Linksys wireless USB link . This computer comes without a serial port that 's why I had to install a Serial Port . The drivers installation were fine , and it did work ( with some , not all applications ) but when I turned off the computer and turned on again the system stopped recognizing the wireless USB , I restarted the system 5 times until it occured to me that it was something about the belkin port , then I unplugged and restarted and presto ! the Linksys worked again , however , now even with the belkin Port unplugged I have to plug-off and plug-in the Linksys card in order to be able to access the lan . I other words , the Belkin installation spoiled my Wireless connection . Be aware that this product may conflict with some of your USB devices , and since some applications wouldn't work I would try another alternative as a PCI serial port card or a USB to Serial cable from another manufacturer .  
1	  We purchased and set up this system 1/3/06 . It is sleek and the sound was fantastic . However 31 days later the subwoofer fan began making an awful noise . The warranty choices were send it to N.J. or drive it 100 miles round trip for repair . We drove it 100 miles for repair . After 20 days they advised they couldn't fix it even after installing a new fan . Another 100 mile round trip to pick it up . On 3/2/06 we shipped the subwoofer to N.J. and got it back on 4/5/06 . By 6/12/06 the subwoofer fan had stopped intermittantly many times and with it all sound from the speakers . We again drove 100 miles and returned the whole home theater system for credit .  
1	  Hello , I 've had the same problem with this tv . The blue blotches and the yellow discoloration . My warranty did expire though Zenith did say they would cover the 2500 dollar part . That 's nice and all , but I assume they are using the same parts that these tvs were initially built with . I expect it will work for about another year or so until I 'm faced with having to shell out all that money to have it fixed again . I 'm wondering if any legal action can be taken against Zenith / LG for manufacturing and selling a defective product ? Perhaps it falls under some kind of product liability law ? I Just want my money back and I 'll be satisfied !  
2	  Protects my WD HD perfectly . All cords and the strap holds in in place not to hurt it 's contents .  
1	  It has been 11 days since I ordered the camera . I have not seen it yet . I cannot find a phone number to contact the store or obtain any customer service . It is not a good deal or a good product when you do not receive any service or the product .  
1	  very pool quality . actually i want to return this product . i dont know how to do that . This is worst product from sony . I never expected this from sony . I spent around $ 80 + for this product . that is my hard earn money .  
2	  this is a great cable for use on a small set . It is flexible and gives a great quality picture !  
2	  I really do love this camera backpack . The only change I would make is to add elastic sides to the camera storage compartment . I had taken my camera out for some photos , and when I returned to my car , I picked the bag from the front seat , and my telephoto lense crashed to the pavement . Amazingly no damage was done . It was my fault for not zipping the camera compartment , but it is an easy thing to overlook . It there were expandable sides sewn into the compartment , my lense would never have hit the ground . Of course , if I had zipped the compartment shut , the lense would have never hit the ground either . It would just be I nice little extra for those of us who need help !  
2	  I bought this case , which fits the Sony RX100 perfectly , and another Sony case at the same time . Sony LCSCSW / L DSC Carrying Case - Blue . The other case didn't fit the RX100 and it just didn't feel as nice . This one is higher quality and just feels nicer .  
2	  I 'm very happy with this product . Originally my system had a CD-RW drive and a DVD-RW drive . However when I got Call of Duty 4 on DVD it wouldn't play in my DVD-RW drive becuase of the copyright software . So I ordered this DVD-Rom drive to replace my CD-RW drive . Installation was very easy and replacing the front cover to black was a snap . Windows detected and installed it without having do a thing , works great with all my existing dvd 's and cd 's . If your looking for a quality DVD-Rom drive then I would highly recommend this one .  
2	  It is great product , like the remote control . It fits into home stereo and easy to switch back and forth .  
2	  This scanner has the best auduio quality I have ever heard and it is made very well . The entire keypad lights up too . The only thing that would of made this better is the CTCSS / DCS feature which I have mentioned to Paul Optiz-product designer at Uniden . It has 250 channels to program , much easier then the newer units like the BCT15 , and BCD996 that use a different programing method . The sensitivity is good , however VHF Low band could be better . I live here in a apartment and can't put a roof antenna up so I am using the stock antenna . It should be noted that I am a volunteer firefighter here in Westchester County and have had scanners since 1974 . To sum it up , buy this unit over the BC350C which is not as good plus Westchester County , NY has just started trunking as of 9/10/07 .  
1	  Its a good printer for regular printing , but trying to print a photo is a pain . You have to push and hold the photo paper into the photo tray so that the printer recognizes that the paper is in it . This only works sometimes , you 'll have to fight error after error message to get it to work .  
2	  This is one of the better combination TV-VCRs I have seen . Panasonic and Sony also both make good 13inch TVs . Toshiba 's combination TV-VCRs often gets overlooked . However , this is an excellent set and performs equally well . The picture is crisp and sharp . The built-in Digital tracking 4 head VCR makes VHS tapes look very good . You get front A / V ( RCA type ) inputs with a TV / game switch . The VCR has good high-speed fast-forward and rewind performance . It also has time-shift recording capability and a built-in head cleaner . The front panel features a useful headphone jack . The ` Black ' cabinet design is uniquely handsome and looks better than other competitor models .  
2	  Works absolutely great as a factory replacement . The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is because I 'm not sure about longevity , only been using it a few weeks now . Works perfectly so far !  
2	  I purchased the headset about 3 months ago . Great sound , great fit . The microphone is perfect for when you just want to listen and not talk , putting it back into the headset was genius . I play wow , and its perfect for what im doing , i also play call of duty 4 and it works great for that as well . The real reason i wanted to put this up is because i did have a problem with the cord . Not the manufactures fault , but mine . I was vacuuming my computer room and got the cord stuck in the vacuum . Now the cord is not just a plastic snag-snap cheap cord . It 's got real fabric wrapped around it , perfect for people who get their cord snagged all the time . But in this case the vacuum had won . The headset still worked fine , with a little humming in the background , but i could tell if i had caught it on something else I 'd be worthless for my next raid . So i emailed steelseries to find out how i could buy a replacement . It was just the extension that had gotten damaged . They told me to save my money for another item , and they would mail me a new extension . WoW ! I promised that I would give this company good name . So i decided to put it up where I had looked to find a good set . I promise you , even before the wire issue ( although it did make me put up this review ) . If you want a good headset , either get these or the 4h 's . Those are are cheaper , but people say they word just as well . You won't be disappointed .  
2	  The Sony FS550/570 is a nice machine : nice screen , slim design , lots of features for home users but lacks behind the competitor 's same offerings such as the Fujistu N3500 Series notebook . This is a great machine for home users .. dual-layer dvd burner is a plus , huge hard drive , but battery life is less than ideal . So if you travel and want a big screen , this is the one to get . If you do alot of graphics work , such as 3D games or intentsive graphics design , try another alternative with a better graphics card .  
1	  I have a desktop and 2 laptops andseveral external hard-drives ofvarious sizes and capacities . My CD collection easily fills a 20 GBdrive in compressed 128 MP3 format . That 's over 500 albums . This is nothing more than a hard-drivewith slimware to drive it ( SMT Tech ) . I can build one myself but it 's not worththe trouble . The problem is moving parts in a portabledevice , not to mention the fact that themoving parts are ALWAYS moving . One bumpthe wrong way while the unit is running andyou might as well light your smokes with100 dollar bills . EEPROM units in the GB range are just aroundthe corner , so save your money until theindustry comes out with a dedicatedNo Moving Parts ( NMP ) unit in the GB range . This unit is almost built to die in 3 yearsor less . It sort of reminds me of theVega and the Pinto .  
1	  I had the same proplem as several of the other reviewers . The unit would not wold a charge . it would only function when plugged into a power source ; and when it did function , the colors were washed out . TAO must have the worst Quality Assurance department on the planet .

1	  prints blurry will not be able to use the paper it was a waste of my money  
1	  Ok so were to begin . This has got to be the biggest pile of wasted money I have ever spent . I have owned one of these for year now , using very sparingly . I would say I have only printed out about 50 images . Though the scanner works great , the printer itself is unresponsive most of the time , says it is out of paper when it is not , and the ink tray is always getting stuck . My opinion of this item is anyone who buys it after reading this review is just plain dumb . It is well worth the extra 50 bucks to buy something that acctually works . HP has done nothing but dig themselves deeper and deeper into my hate list . PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH HP DEVICES !  
1	  I purchased this headset with the Panasonic cordless phones . I thought " same manufacturer , it 'll work great . " Wrong . The headset feels great . The mic stays close by my mouth without being intrusive , the speaker stays over my ear . You can even hear the person you 're talking to . The problem is there is a loud hum that is entirely too distracting to allow . I can't use the headset . So I have thrown my money down the toilet on this one . Sad , Panasonic usually makes quality products .  
1	  I think I 'm the unlucky one . When I connect this cable between DMA2100 and 1080p LCDTV , I get , what I believe , the HDMI handshake issue . The screen flashes several times . After replacing it with a $ 40 one , this issue went away . If I reconnect the problematic cable , the same problem is reproduced .  
2	  I did a lot of research on this PC , and it 's proving to be everything I thought it would . Fast , quiet , lots of features . Amazon offered a great price , minus the sales tax and shipping , so even " comparision shopping " with local stores , there simply was no comparision , especially when you know what you wanted , and I did .  
1	  I 've purchased this unit and luckily was able to returned it back for full retail that I paid for , they gave me a gift card which I 'm happy with . Stores normaly charge restocking fee up to 25 % . After 2 days of using this unit the power button works whenever feels like , on the third day the button would only work when plugging in the unit in my carand maybe after 2-3 minutes of trying to turn it on * Home antena never picked up anything indoors at my house at my work or my friends place so pretty much ur stuck listening to recordings ( if u have any ) . Same thing with the Antena headphones - * not picking up any signal at all * - * Whitout the antena this unit picks signal - outside or when driving it 's about 40 % - 70 % good reception and I 'm saying this because if u walk around or when u drive there 's places ( many ) where is loosing signal , so if u r recording in the same time ur recording the static and noise - so try listening to that song later - it 's a shame . * The songs that ur recording are not recorded in full unless u pressed the record button in time ( in the beggining ) * u do have an option to edit your songs at a later time over the web on your computer , not a bad idea but thoese days with so many things to do forgive me but I don't have time to edit songs . * Some radio stations are not even set up yet .. * Car kit * there 's 2 options1 ) pay about $ 80 - yea it 's sold separatly and install it urself -I did it myself , anyone can do it . 2 ) pay $ 30 ( it 's a different kit ) and have it proffesional installed cost extra from $ 75 to $ 150 . Oh yea , the trial period should be 2 weeks .. * There 's no trial period * they charge you full even it should have been a trial and I used it for 4 days total they charged me one time activation fee $ 10 and montly charge , they did not want to prorate the service . Now that 's another reason I will never purchase another XM in my life . * Also when you call custumer service be prepared to wait over 40 min than when someone comes live will ask you all quastions so 10 min later can tell you that they will transfer you to another cust svc and when I asked why ? just cold trasfered me to the elevator music and finally after that 4rth time I got someone kind that had a good attitude and helped me out and she was very surprised that I 've been transferd 4rth time to her . Online acc it 's really hard to navigate just like old school web sites .  
2	  Just for taking photographs , the Sony 828 is the third best camera I own . But the other cameras do not do nearly as well focusing in low light ( where the Sony uses a matrix of lasers ) nor do they take short movies like the Sony will for those situations in which you want more than a photo . I can certainly go out and create purple fringing with this camera . And it overall is not as sharp as my others . Nor will it adapt itself by accepting alternative lenses . But it will consistently get excellent shots under non-extreme conditions . And if you need to get a short talkie , this is the only camera in this range that will do it .  
2	  I have the armored version , the Nikon Action 7x50 EX Extreme ATB binocular , so most of the comments you read about these will apply to those as well . I have owned those for several years now and I have enjoyed them immensely . The field of vision is good , but not fantastic . Clarity is unbelievable . But where they REALLY excel is in low light viewing ( see chart on the Nikon Action 7x50 EX Extreme ATB binocular main page ) . I can easily see things in the dark that my naked eye just can't grab , and I have excellent night vision . Amazing how much I miss without them . You might consider paying the fifty dollar premium and get the Nikon Action 7x50 EX Extreme ATB . This buys you rubberized armor for bumps , water-proofing and fog-proofing . This also means you won't get condensation inside when going from hot to cold or visa-versa . If you get in and out of your car or house a lot , use binoculars outdoors in the mist or rain , or take them through brush , it 's worth the extra money . If you look at things through your window or only in good weather , save your money and get the Action 7 X 50 . You may want to check the chart I mentioned above . It has information on all of the pertinent specs to help you choose the right size . It applies to both the Action and Action EX Extreme series .  
2	  I didn't find this one before I wrote a review then I posted to the 320GB . Here it is . I bought two acomdata 160GB external HD . The quality is very good , very reliable , never feel hot whenever I touch the shell . One is very quiet , another has clear sound but still ok . I never opened the box to see which company 's hard disk is inside it , but my two years use already comfort me this is a good product that can be relied on .  
1	  I have to use this printer at my work and I am counting the days for it to be replaced with ANYTHING else . This printer is a nightmare . It jams constantly , tearing off the sheets is a pain to do . I do not have one positive thing to say about this printer , if you need something like it , search elsewhere . Avoid this printer at ALL COSTS .  
2	  I 'm a first time GPS user and this item has proved to be a great addition to my life . I have used it locally and in a very large city with no problems . The unit recalculates quickly whenever a wrong turn is made and it will probably save my 34 year marriage .  
1	  I bought two of these . One works great , the other failed out of the box . After trying to figure out why my audio / video receiver wasn't sending a picture to my LCD TV , I checked the cable with an ohm meter - there 's a break in the cable somewhere . You 'll read some reviews that 'll say " it 's just pushing 1 's and 0 's " , that 's true . You have to ask yourself why the electrical cable to your clothes dryer is so much different than the one to your clock radio - " it 's just pushing electricity " :-) Buy these if you want , just remember , there 's a risk associated with the savings .  
2	  The Zune is a wonderful media player , and is very easy to manipulate . The design is dynamic in its simplicity and easy to navigate . If there is a downside , it is scarcely to be found in the player itself . The Zune software , sadly , is decidedly sub-par . While frequent updates have improved the user-friendliness over the past year , it is still cumbersome and awkward . I , like many , am forced to do any editing or grouping on an alternate program and then load it into Zune . As far as the device is concerned , my only complaint is that playlists cannot be created on the go , only at the computer . The ' currently playing ' list is a poor option because it is far too easy to push one button incorrectly , say pressing ' play song ' instead of ' add to now playing ' , and the list you just compiled for your car ride home is erased .  
2	  these bic america rtr1530 speakers are as good as expensive speakers . You say " how can they be as good as my speakers ? i spent 10 times the money so mine must be better . " not really , you just overpaid . i dont think these are cheapos , i just think the audio industry wants us to believe we have to spend hundreds of dollars to get quality and its not true . so if overpaying makes you think your speakers sound better , go for it .  
2	  I bought two of these straps . One for our D-SLR camera and one for our full size 10X50 binoculars . The strap works very well for both of these applications . The only complaint is that it could be a bit wider . There was an error made in the shipping cost . Shipping cost were applied to each strap even though they shipped in the same package . We called this error to Op / Tech 's attention and it was resolved immediately . I would buy this item again .  
2	  I love this cooler pad . It has a low profile and a constant fan . It is quiet . I set it on my lap desk under my computer . It is lightweight and unobtrusive , but elevates the laptop by less than inch in front . If it saves my thermal pad from replacement ( it failed before I bought this product ) then I will be a happy girl .  
1	  This replacement battery does not fit into the phone 's battery compartment as well as the original - it 's smaller and doesn't sit securely . The item arrived with no power and it took at least a week to charge up in the phone caddy . Shipping from Amazon was slow , however the ( expensive ) express shipping option was not selected . After about a month the phone finally seems to be back in proper working order . Too soon to tell about battery life .  
2	  The picture is wonderful . The features are terrific . The ease of use is astounding . FYI - I 'm a James Bond fan and own a few titles . One of the movie channels had a Bond-a-thon a few days ago , so I decided to put my Philips DVD recorder to the test . I recorded one of the titles that I already own from the movie channel broadcast to my DVR . The next day , I recorded the movie from my DVR to a DVD . I then had my family watch the first 10 minutes from each movie on one of our other DVD players and , based upon picture , sound quality , etc . , tell me which one they thought was the store bought version and which one was the recorded version . My wife and all three kids picked my recording over the store bought version of the movie . Truly remarkable . The primary reason that I bought the recorder is to build upon our DVD collection without having to fork over the big $ to buy the movies from the store ( the HDMI connection and upconverting were icing on the cake ) . At $ 180 for the recorder and about $ 1 per blank DVD disc , the thing is going to pay for itself with 10 recordings and then it 's all gravy from there . Also , I travel a lot and have about 80 hours of programming on my DVR that I never seem to have enough time to watch . Now I 'll be able to burn those programs to a DVD and watch them on my laptop when I 'm on the road ! How awesome is that ? ! ? ! ? ! Five stars for the Philips DVD recorder - no doubt . I had tried a few other DVD recorders before I found this one ( including a tunerless Philips ) - for most , I had paid more and received less . For those of you with complex audio / video setups , beware of DVD recorders that don't have a built in tuner . I don't need the tuner for OTA broadcasts , I need it to make my A / V life hassle free . I 'm sure glad that I found this baby ..  
1	  This antenna did not work well at all . I purchased the GE and it works much better . I receive all of the channels in my area . I do not recommend this product .  
1	  Be aware , this reader , although it works , it will NOT read HDSD cards , it is ONLY able to read the OLDER SD cards ( ie - those smaller than 4gig ) I goofed , and did not read closely enough - and now have reader that will not work with the cards I need to use it with . Mea culpa , but hopefully this review will keep folks from buying this reader thinking it will read the modern , larger HDSD cardsBottom line , this is obsolete technology . Get something like the BlueProton or any other card reader that IS compatable with the newer standardJohn  
1	  DO NOT BUY THIS ! It may work with Nintendo Advanced - BUT IT DOES NOT WORK WITH THE DS . SHIPPING IT BACK TO THEM COSTS MORE THAN THE ITEN ITSELF !  
1	  The VuPoint reviews are misleading , The VuPoint Camera is just a cheap cell phone camera disguised as an underwater camera , and it is not even a good camera at all . If you don't believe me just take a good look at the camera lens and you will notice that it looks exactly like you phone camera lens . Actually , any cell phone currently in the market can take better pictures than this VuPoint . I returned it before I had a chance test the waterproof case , but the case looked flimsy and the locking mechanism does not have a secure lock , it may open accidentally underwater . Also this camera wins the price as the electronic device with the most fake reviews I have ever seen on Amazon . You have been warned .  
1	  My husband and I received this monitor for our baby shower . We selected this model because it had the two monitors and the price was resonable . Well I firmly believe you get what you pay for because this monitor does not hold a charge . We have to have the monitors plugged in at all times for it to work . The batteries just dont hold a charge . The reception is good but we can't unplug it and use it around the house . We wound up throwing it out and purchasing a new one . Don't waste you money on this monitor .  
2	  I have this card in my Canon XSI 12 MP camera and it can hold over 1000 pictures and is fast .  
1	  I was very disappointed with the quality . The worst quality of goods I have ever purchase . basically , it makes images very unclear . It sat at my home now .  
1	  Product only worked once , used it for 30min and it was dead . Waste of my money .  
2	  Works straight out of the box . Have not done anything with the Garmin site yet . Treking is fast and mostly accurate , although the routes selected may not always be the best and the " voice " is reluctant to change to a better route . Would be really nice if the unit have a more pocketable form factor ( more boxy ) like some of the others . It can actually be used as a hand held GPS .  
1	  Someone ( and I believe it to be Sony Music ) really crippled this little guy . NetMD could have been real cool , but it 's nothing but a hassle . It 's no wonder MD didn't catch on , even with the introduction of NetMD . First , OpenMG is simply horrible . You have to Check Out the music files that you copy to it , and you only get 3 check outs . To delete a file off the MD , you have to Check In the track . You can't just drag & drop MP3 files individually either , you have to set up a whole " playlist " . Not to mention , OpenMG is buggy and crashes 9 % through the transfer . I downloaded SonicStage 1.5 ( OpenMG 's replacement ) and it 's still as crippled and bloated with the same check in / check out rules and stupid playlists . I don't know why I can't just drag & drop MP3 's to the MD . If the terrible software weren't bad enough , all MP3 's , WAV 's , etc . are converted to LP2 ATRAC3 files , so your hard drive space gets wasted . That also means if you copy MP3 's to the MD in SP mode , what you 're getting is just LP2 converted to PCM , then the N505 itself reconverts the PCM to ATRAC . NetMD is hardly worthwhile compared to realtime recording via SPDIF . About the only thing NetMD is good for is editing track titles from the PC .  
2	  I have only had the case for about a month , but so far it seems fine . It is a little hard to open from time to time ( depending on how coordinated I feel that day ! ) . But I 'd still recommend it .  
1	  The remote does not make contact with the cradle properly so it will not charge . It is a very fussy process to get it to charge . Buy another model is my suggestion .  
1	  Base on the high reviews on Amazon and Cnet , I was excited to get one . Amazon shipped the product super fast . Plugged in the HDMI cable to my 2007 Panasonic plasma , adjusted the player settings , nothing looked better . Noticable was the sound . Sound is way better than the normal dvd player . So I bought the Panasonic upconverter for $ 100 and the graphic is acceptable than this Oppo 891 . Good luck . Hope you have better luck than I did .  
1	  No firmware upgrades yet available as of 3/19/05 . The expert that I chatted with on Linksys was a smug loser who asked me questions like , is it plugged in ? After answering his ridiculous questions and explaining the same thing 15 times he finally told me that I should get my router replaced .. sounds like the wrong advice , since many people have the same problems . I am guessing with a new unit I will have the same issues . Internet connection will drop out periodically . Until they recall it or update the firmware . Will a firmware upgrade fix the issue ? Maybe . When will it arrive ? I will probably be taking mine back . Might give AT & T one more attempt to keep me as a customer by calling their help line . But they may go the way of my former Lingo service .  
1	  We purchased 6 of these for our elementary school classrooms . The trigger that pushes down the sensor that tells the unit when the CD lid is closed seems to be microns too short , and you have to slam down the lid to make this sensor actually sense . Sometimes it will think the lid opens while playing a CD , which is a nuisance . If you need it for the radio , this should do the trick , but if you want to play CD 's , you could probably find something better .  
2	  This card works perfectly , and does everything I could ask of it . Durable , easy to use , and spacious . I used this particularly for an LG Vu for about a year , and then passed it down to my little brother , who is still using it after an additional year . It can be slow transferring large amounts of data , so don't try to use it as a flash drive between computers .  
1	  If I hadn't already been using a full food processor to prepare salads , I might have liked this . It DOES make nice & # 34 ; wavy cut & # 34 ; cucumbers ( as my grand kids call them ) . And it DOES a great job of grating raw cauliflower ( the output looks just like white cheese gratings . ) BUT , it also mangles salad onions , and takes way longer to do things than does the food processor . The big problem with the Shooter is that it rotates too slow for anything like lettuce . The output clogs up . Just not what I hoped for .  
1	  The sound quality was good with these earbuds , until they broke ! These earbuds are very cheap quality and broke the second time I put them in my ear . The dark0 gray , back casing just separated from the part where you put your ear in , and guess what ? There was just a small amount of glue holding it together . I expected more from Monster , which is usually a brand that makes a good name for itself , but this time , they let me down . Also , these are the old models and do not come with the thing to hold your two wires together when you are listening to music . I would not recommend this to anyone unless they want a good sound paired with very cheap quality .  
1	  This unit seemed like a good purchase due to its small footprint and low price . I purchased two units for my home and have been very disappointed . The first unit never worked properly : many DVDs simply would not play . Others stopped playing partway through , pausing for 10 seconds or more , or entirely locking up the unit ( which required unplugging the power cord to resolve ) . The Second unit worked very well for about six months , although for some reason , this one did not have a volume control like the first one did . I was particularly impressed that such an inexpensive machine was able to re-sync the audio track as needed . However , it started doing the same thing as the first unit - and then it died entirely . Overall , this product has good features , but it fails miserably in the reliability department .  
2	  Adapter is perfect for my needs for my older HP iPAQ device . Some older product parts are hard to find . Glad I found this one .  
2	  I always buy Nikon brand cameras for their good quality . The Nikon Coolpix 4300 does not disappoint me either . The images are very sharp . I test the Black-and-White mode , the photo came out very impressive as well . There are some minor issues , 1 . Battery Life is short . But if I do not keep reviewing the pctures , the battery will last longer . I bought an extra battery just in case . 2 . If the monitor is on , the camera will keep doing auto-focus . This can be stopped by shut-down monitor view . Overall , I am very satisfy with this purchase and still a Nikon brand believer .  
1	  I really didn't have good luck with this fax printer . It would try to send a fax once and then give up if it got a busy signal or other interruption . It would then make this really annoying alarm sound that basically meant " tough luck buddy " . I tried working with the settings but couldn't figure it out . I tried using it as a backup printer but the driver I downloaded didn't work . The wizard software wouldn't recognize the printer being plugged in even though the computer did . It did make copies okay . If anyone wants one , they can have mine .  
2	  I just got it a few weeks ago and have yet to fill the card but am happily taking lovely clear pictures .  
1	  I had my laptop for about 10 months before the hard drive inexplicably crashed on me . I would rate this a zero if I could , but the lowest is a 1 . The service center Toshiba told me to have it repaired at couldn't identify any specific problems . They simply told me it was faulty and had to be replaced and none of my files were recoverable . The service center didn't even replace it with another hard drive of the same capacity . Toshiba won't take responsibility for helping me recover my files through another resource , reinstalling my software or reimbursing me for hundreds of dollars worth of music downloaded on my original hard drive .. or , even worse , the countless and priceless pictures I had saved to my computer in the past year . I have yet to speak with anyone at Toshiba who has been able to help resolve any problems . No one in their customer relations is ever available to talk . I have been on hold waiting to speak with someone for hours ! As a single mother whose livelihood depends on the use of a computer , this whole thing has left me beyond angry . Shame on Toshiba for building such undependable products and not standing behind them or taking responsibility when they break .  
2	  This is my first GPS so I did lots of research on the web to figure out which was the best one for me . The first step was to decide how much I wanted to pay which was no more then $ 200 . The second step was to decide on features . I knew I wanted the GPS loaded with maps of both the USA and Canada , some systems don't come with maps of Canada unless you purchase them . The next feature I wanted was turn by turn with text to speech as I liked the idea of hearing the street names as I approached them . I also wanted a GPS that was rated as very accurate and fast . As for additional features like MP3 and picture viewer , thought it would be neat , but not essential . I began my research at CNET , Amazon , Best Buy and Circuit City plus a few other sites on the net I can't remember now . I read their reviews and also the reviews of the folks who actually bought the devices . I came down to the choice between the Garmin c580 and Garmin c550 . The difference was that the c580 had MSN Direct services free which gives you local gas prices , real time traffic and movie times free for a year . Otherwise I could find no real difference . The price at the time I purchased the c580 was only a few dollars more . Now where I live there is no MSN coverage , but when I went to Las Vegas I had coverage and down in the southern part of Maine there is coverage . I have no plans to extend my membership once it expires . I have really liked the GPS as I have found it extremely accurate . The MP3 player works well , but because of the size of speakers , not really that great to listen to music . The display and voice are very clear . It has Blue tooth functionality . The screen size is 3.5 in which is right for me . I would recommend this GPS as very good . My only recommendation before you buy a GPS is to do your research and read the reviews of the folks who purchased it to get a good general sense of the product .  
2	  Easy to use , protects your ipod perfectly , and the screen is still very clear . Only problem , cant plug it in on normal travel speakers without taking the ipod out of its case , which is not the easiest thing to put back on . If you can devote one minute extra for this , you will love it .  
2	  Used this as soon as I recieved it & am very happy with it . Was plug N play on my laptop but it does come with software .  
1	  At all costs , if you purchase this model , AVOID the " factory refurbished " models . Here 's why : First , the CD player for my unit did not work at all . It thought every CD I put in it was a cd-r , which , to my surprise , it does not play . Second , the speakers had far too much bass sound , and no way to lower / adjust it . Sound was muddy and muffled at best . Finally , reception was not great . Unless you live on a hill , forget trying to get anything but your area 's strongest radio signals .  
1	  I read the product reviews before buying this and thought it would be nice to use for our Wii system instead of countless alkaline batteries . It turned out to be a waste of time . The batteries take a few hours to charge and that 's OK . But when they only have a working charge of just 5 minutes in a Wii remote , they cause more harm by interrupting the game with ' lost communication ' failures . Even when executing the loonngg ' refresh ' charge cycle , the batteries fared no better . The charger says the batteries are fully charged when I take them out , but they don't have the right stuff for practical use . I can't recommend this product and suggest you look elsewhere for a rechargeable solution .  
2	  Now that the era of 1st gen iPod shuffles is actually long time over and this connector can be bought for cheap ( I paid $ 8 for mine , including shipping and handling ) , it can do the job quite nicely as a stand for USB thumb drives . No more bending when inserting thumb drives into under-the-desk slots or struggling to find the USB connectors on the back of the keyboard . Note : the idea is not mine , I saw it on flickr .  
2	  This webcam does everything a similarly priced Creative Labs one didn't . I LOVE IT . 1 . Hardware . Is wide angle enough so captures more than whole face at normal 2 to 3 foot distances . Does an Excellent job in poor light . Is Autofocus . Is higher resolution than other similarly pricedwebcams by Creative Labs ( 2 Megapixel , vs 1.2 Megapixel ) . 2 . Drivers - Color tint was always perfect , and no adjustment needed . 3 . Software - Easy Install , Allows one to zoom the image if desired . 4 . Instructions - Either clips to monitor or mounts on ( supplied ) 11 inch tall plastic stick with base . On a Macintosh , no software needed , it 's natively supported on OS X 10.5 and 10.6 , whith sharp image , and prefect color . Not quite as good as ( more expensive ) Stand-alone external Apple iSight Camera , but half the price ; and this camera works on both Macintosh and Windows platforms , which iSight doesn't . Drivers available for 64 bit Windows 7 .  
1	  I spent many hours tring to connect my computer to the wirless router . I could not figure it out . Electronic cards going bad was the last thing I would suspect but I was not correct . The Card 1024 was my problem and I don't recommend buying one . I know electonics and this card failed me where other have not .  
2	  Works as advertised . Great build quality . This cable works perfectly for hooking up a an HDMI-equipped Xbox 360 to a DVI monitor for excellent picture quality . Remarkably better price than what you would find in stores .  
2	  These batteries work like they are supposed to . They are much less than the Canon brand , and are well worth the price to have that piece of mind knowing that you probably wont run out of battery with these with you . The free mini tripod that came with these is pretty pointless though .  
2	  I 've had this laptop for about a week now and I 'd have to say that I 'm impressed by it . It 's perfect for the average user . I upgraded to this from using a Toshiba 4005CDS laptop . The current version of the Toshiba Satellite 1415 does have 400 MHz front side bus and - while the tech specs on Toshiba 's web site say differently - this one does have 256MB of DDR RAM . DVD playback looks good . I viewed my copy of Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring Special Edition and it looks great ! Pulling up the subtitling and listening to the commentaries tends to slow it down just a tad , but it 's hardly noticeable . It burns CDs easily and even comes with a built in floppy drive . For some of us , the floppy drive is still essential . It also has an ECP parallel port , for those who require bi-direction communication . I sync my laptop frequently with my desktop ( using FileVan as opposed to LapLink ) , so this is an essential feature for me as well . And it has internet scrolling too . If you run your finger along the right edge or bottom edge of the touchpad , you can scroll your browser window , or scroll through any application window . Prior to the Satellite 1415 , I actually checked out an HP laptop , but that didn't work out too well for me . It kept crashing while I was on the internet so I took it back after a mere three days . But I 've had no problems with the 1415 . I 'm really happy about his purchase . I haven't tried playing games on it yet , but with the nVidia graphics card , it should do just fine for some of the less graphics intensive games . I suspect that if you want a mind-blowing 3D experience this is not the one for you . In fact , if gaming is all you do you 're better off with a desktop . If that 's not the case , and you 're an average user like me ( word processing , e-mail , DVD , multitasking , the occasional game ) , this laptop will do the job . My only gripe , and the reason I give it only 4 stars , is that the modem is a software modem and not a hardware modem . The modem on my old laptop was much better . But for those of you who have taken the leap into DSL - I 'll admit that I 'm still using only a dial-up connection - then this is something you won't have to worry about since this laptop has an ethernet port .  
1	  This is the worst digital camera i 've ever owned . Flaws : 1 . autofocus is slow and in about 50 % of cases will focus on the wrong central object . This is evident because small bracket signs bracket the object that the camera is focusing on . So it is readily apparent whether your subject agrees with the camera 's . About half the time it won't . Don't try to just snap a picture without seeing where the brackets are located or you will be severely disappointed . 2 . The shutter lag is unforgivably slow . You have to half depress the button to see what it is focusing on , this takes about 0.5 sec , and then depress fully to take your picture , another 0.4 sec . By this time your subject is long gone .. 3 . The autoflash is horrible . This is in part a consequence of numbers 1 and 2 above . Because the autofocus is often mistargeted and slow , the flash will be tailored for the wrong subject . 4 . Indoor photography is blurred or overexposed . Again , because the autofocus is so slow , if you try to take a simple flash photo , it will either shut off the flash entirely or overexpose your photo . Forget low light pictures . 5 . The touch screen is absolutely pointless . Program mode is also pointless since low light photos are so grainy as to be unviewable . 6 . The cycling time between 2 photos is extremely slow . If you are trying to capture several photos of a meaningful scene , forget it . Just take 1 and hope it is in focus . 7 . The battery is proprietary , rather short lived , and slow to charge in the provided charger . So your option is to shell out $ 40 for another battery . Pros : In outdoor full light conditions the pictures are satisfactory . But not at dusk or night time , and forget trying to take cool night time outdoor pictures . Again , this is the worst digital camera i 've ever owned . There are identically priced cameras from Canon and Kodak which are vastly superior . And i 'm going back to them . Or maybe i 'll try a Casio . I had a 3mp Kodak ez-share which i hated but was much much better than this product . if anyone from pentax wants to make up for this travesty they can contact me at [ .. ] Please avoid this device .  
1	  Stay away from these , get a higher quality cable . The BlueRigger High Speed HDMI Cable were fantastic , and only six bucks each . Or get the mediabridge ultra series for only ten dollars . Just stay away from this cheaply made junk .  
1	  The first set I bought lasted about 2 weeks before the microphone went out , the replacement lasted 4 days before the microphone went out . Also they were very uncomfortable , made my ears hurt and were ill fitted for small ears . Overall a huge disapointment , my first one with plantronics products . I definete " DO NOT BUY "  
2	  Item is as advertized . It comes with wall mounting brackets which can be used to mount the speakers and main unit to the wall . It works well and sounds pretty good for a small stereo . I have a Sirius receiver connected through the aux jack and it works and sounds good .  
1	  This thing died on me after about 3 weeks and the hardest hardware installation i 've ever had to do . I thought i was getting a deal when i bought it , but was i ever wrong . what a piece of junk ! buy nvidia .  
2	  This is a great remote . It controls everthing in my house , from my stereo to my computer . The software to get everthing setup is easy to use and doesnt take much time to tweek . Logitech Harmony 550 Universal RemoteBuy it before the Riddler does .  
2	  This bag is awesome . Light and strong , with more than enough space and pouches to hold my wireless base and mic , the wireless base for my in-ear monitors , the monitors / ear buds case and hip pack , two sets of cables , two power supplies , a flashlight and extra batteries . It 's compact and weighs a ton less than my hard case . After I received this , I was so impressed I bought two more Gator bags ( different styles ) for some other musical equipment .  
1	  I purchased this adapter to enable hook up of a scrolling sign . Cable does not recognize sign . After finding this out , I tried to remove software from my computer . It will not uninstall . Have tried everything to no avail .  
2	  Not much to review here , it is what it is . The cable comes with the cable connections already attached , which I didn't realize , but that just meant we had to cut them off . Other than that , it 's cable ! My only complaint is that on 2 of the 3 rolls we purchased , the plastic base and tops were either broken or busted off completely , which in turn made a mess when spooling .  
1	  This TV is good in all ways but the ONE thing I bought it for : HD . I bought the $ 100 HDMI cable to get true HD and this TV does NOT support HDCP ( Copy Protection ) when I connect it to my HD-DVR cable from Time Warner in NYC . Before you buy this or any HDTV , check to make sure it does not block you from getting HD because of HDCP . It varies by specific TV model , and not by brand . One Samsung TV may allow , while another may block . This information is not readily available on the checklist of features that you use to comparison shop , so find that out BEFORE you buy and get stuck like I did . I would totally return this TV had I not already thrown away the box .  
2	  I needed a cable to connect my iPhone to the fm transmitter I installed in the back of my Jeep Commander . ( I couldn't find a decent FM modulator to listen to my tunes with ) This works perfectly ! Along with the FM transmitter I bought , I can now hear my songs while driving down the highway , and so can anyone else who happens to tune in !  
2	  I have had these for about a week . I love the soft rubber caps-three sizes included ; very soft and much more comfortable than foam caps . They don't slide / pop out of your ears , either . Bass response is respectable for this price . Asymmetrical cord design is comfortable . Cord separates in the middle - you can use shorter length for arm or pocket player location ; add extension for belt or backpack use . A small ear buds-only case is included , which keeps the buds protected from dust or other unwanted dirt when not in use . Also included is a felt drawstring pouch to hold pieces you aren't using , or all of the parts if desired . I 'm very pleased so far . I have used them for jazz , rock and classical listening . They are not active noise-cancelling type , but in-ear design blocks out most noise , anyway .  
1	  This battery is an exact replacement for my Panasonic phone . I was very disappointed to see that Amazon ( not a reseller ) sent a battery with packaging already neatly sliced open . The battery came right out . So far the battery works fine but I don't know how long it will last or its prior history . It 's not worth the effort and expense to send it back so I 'll live with it , but not pleased with the experience .  
1	  I 'LL KEEP IT SHORT AND SWEET : I WAS JUST TOLD THAT THIS PANASONIC POWER SUPPLY DOES NOT WORK WITH MY NEW PANASONIC CORDLESS PHONE SYSTEM , MODEL NO . KX-TG4031 . EVEN I JUST PLACED THE ORDER 30 MINUTES AGO , IT IS ALREADY IN PROCESS AND CANNOT BE CANCELLED OR CHANGED . THE THING PROBABLY WORKS WITH CERTAIN OTHER PHONE SYSTEMS , BUT I SHALL BE STUCK WITH A USELESS BACK-UP POWER SUPPLY FOR MY PHONE 'S BASE UNIT . BUYER , BEWARE !  
2	  I tested these and they do float my Steiner Observer 7 x 50 binoculars . And it does not need the clip-loc fittings as mentioned in another review . That is the case for the model 769 . The 768 model ( which this one is ) has a simple nylon strap that loops around a post on the binoculars and clips back on itself .  
2	  This card was easy to set up and worked better than the Netgear WRN111 usb device that I had before . The reception is great as if I have a wired connection . For the price this card is great . The only inconvenience is the antenna that has a little wire which is annoying anytime you need to do anything in the back of your computer , but I knew that when I bought it .  
2	  This battery is well worth the money . I bought one to get longer battery output from regular rechargeable batteries . After trying it , I bought another one .  
2	  Got this for around 2 months now and it is really a very comfortable backpack . I have a Canon rebel XTI with 3 lenses , polarising filters and tripod . They fit very snugly in the various compartments . There are a couple of other compartments ( with zippers ) to keep the battery , covers and all such small stuff which we never think about . The customer images uploaded give a good picture of how to fit the various stuff . It is a great buy . Definitely recommended !  
1	  Battery was able to turn the computer on but it did not charge . I have been dealing with INKTONERSTORE for over a month .. After the first two weeks I gave up and sent the battery back to TOSHIBA .. The item was delivered at Toshiba 2 weeks ago and I still have no resolution .. I am very disappointed and I hope that Amazon will help me out to get this resolve ASAP .. Still waiting for a battery since DEC 1st .  
1	  Caused blue screen of death on new Toshiba satellite laptop . Two hour 's help from Belkin 's telephone support failed to fix the problem . I returned it and bought the Toshiba docking station instead , which is what I should have bought in the first place .  
1	  I just received this ANR-20 headphone . What I observed is it noise cancellation feature works fine but it fails in the sound quality . It sounds like a $ 5 headphone with poor bass and sound quality ! Also no volume control on the headphone , uncomfortable for big head . Try some other noise canceling one .. better to spend some 20 bucks more to get better sound quality !  
2	  Called Adorama because I wasn't sure how to use it . Very helpful . Very good company to buy from .  
1	  I got these after breaking a pair of Sharper Image noise-cancelling headphones , thinking that Sennheiser would be a good replacement , noise-cancelling or not . Not really . I used them just one day , trying them with digitally remastered music , even music mixed in * 5.1 Surround Sound * , and there was just no boom from the bass , like was promised on the packaging . At a higher volume , the music is slightly more quality , but the music still lacked substance to me . There was this , and there was the fact that the leatherette around the edge of each of the earpieces gave me discomfort because the phones concealed my ears completely but not my lobes , and it felt almost like blood got cut off at that part . For this and the above reason I am sending these things back . In all , don't get these if you want wraparound headphones and you think " Sennheiser = Class . " I suppose these would be more suitable as DJ headphones , but I do not know .  
2	  Product was delivered as promised . Quality and performance are better than expected . I recommend it .  
1	  I bought this drive about a year ago and I don't burn dvds very often , still it worked well for about only 6 months . The drive also has a loud train like sound . Not good if you 're into audio recording . After 6 months , every dvd AND cd burn gave buffer underrun errors . Now the drive acts as a DVD-ROM as the burning capabilites are depleted . I can see my review is consistent with the others , as you get what you pay for . I learned my lesson to not buy from generic dvd writers , as paying 30 dollars more would have saved me the hassle from buying a new one .  
2	  The instructions for adding a product could be clearer - which is probably why some give up on the product . Instead of having to move the arrow to each letter to spell in a new product you can just speak the letter . When spelling , you don't have to press Record . You also have to be aware that each added product needs to go in its own group so the printout will put it in the correct category . A couple of places I have had problems : 1 . have to find the word again to pronounce the word more than once ( e.g. glucosamine is not recognized with just one training ) . 2 . Adding a word ( by spelling ) is very easy if the unit is on the refrigerator but is close to impossible if you are trying to set it up on your desk before you put it on the refrigerator3 . Instructions for adding multiple units are OK but haven't gotten them to work . Haven't tried coupons . It 's easier to just mark on the list by pen . All in all it 's very useful even if you don't have the time or energy to figure out all of the features . And it 's readable - unlike our prior grocery list !  
2	  A very good audio system , but sounds exactly the same as the previous IM2 which you can have for half the price . I have been all my life in HI-FI , and honestly believe I can easily distinguish the characteristic sound of any of these kind of systems . Nevertheless , to me , IM2 and IM4 really sound exactly the same . So , before buying an IM4 , give a try to IM2s or ( if you believe me ) just look for IM2s'offers at Amzon or elsewhere ( they are still very popular systems ) . As said above , you will find IM2s for HALF the price of IM4s .  
2	  Although this camcorder is relatively inexpensive , it does have enough features to make it a perfect video camera for anyone . No one will know you only paid a little over $ 200.00 ! Very small footprint , fits in the palm of your hand . I have another camcorder that I paid about 3 times as much for and unless you are a professional , there really is no difference !  
2	  I don't know what 's up with all the bad reviews on here . I 've used mine every day for 2 years and had no problems . My dad has one that 's 3 years old and he hasn't had a problem either .. Maybe its expensive for a power adapter , but mine works great .  
1	  There 's no real way to tell if this thing will grab a weak signal or not . The installation directions are simple if you don't put a security lock on the device , but I 've been in situations with it when it grabs and amplifies the signal , and some when it does nothing . And I can't figure out the variables . So it 's a crap shoot .  
2	  Well , I tried to do some research before I bought these E2 headphones . They sounded like they pretty comparable , not great , but comparable . So , I bought them and they live up to my expectations . The sound isolation is ok when you don't have music playing , but when you have music playing , and depending how high you have the sound , these babies will block out almost anything . Even when I have the sound less than half on my ipod mini these E2 's block out most ambient noise . The sound quality is fantastic , but I am far from a music expert . The bass boost is nonexistant , but I could care less . However , these earphones go inside your ear canal , which takes some time to get used to . Also , the earpieces that come with the headphones are very specific to what they can be used for . The soft coverings form to your ear very nicely but they get dirt on them very easily . The hard coverings are also nice , however , it takes some time to get used to . Also , both coverings are hard to keep in your ear when you sweat , so that is something to keep in mind .  
2	  Two things I like about this cable . One is the price , which is very reasonable , and the other is the snag-proof end . The reason I needed to buy several is my old ones got snagged and broke off the arm . So far , the cables are working just fine .  
2	  i am very satisfied about this product in terms of quality price & delivery timei advise all the people to buy it , its perfect  
2	  Two things I particularly like about this product . One : the choice of earbud sizes so one can actually get the best comfortable fit . Two : the convenient , innovative cord keeper which keeps the tangle out of the way yet provides easy use .  
2	  It 's OEM Cannon toner . what 's not to love but the price ? Well the price isn't even a concern when it 's on the company Amex . I go through about 1 of these every year in my home office Cannon multi function center . Unit is almost 6 years old now and all it does is print print print .  
2	  I purchased these earphones specifically for covert listening at work but have found myself using them almost constantly , in favor of more expensive , but less portable headphones . For the price , I 'm quite impressed with the sound quality of this set . True audiophiles would want to invest in a higher-end set ( would true audiophiles even use earbuds ? ) , but I 'm very happy with the quality to value ratio of this pair . The earbuds are much more comfortable than I 'd anticipated . I have never been able to stand a pair of earphones , but found that the multiple size selections were helpful ( I still do wish the smallest size was a bit smaller ) . I agree that the cord is a bit awkward . I 'm told that the design ( uneven cord length , offset to one side ) is to prevent them from falling off onto the ground - by draping the longer cord around the back of one 's neck , and the cord connecting to the player to the front of one 's body . I do have to say that though this design does annoy me sometimes , it has prevented me from dropping the phones on grimmy sidewalks quite a few times . As for the earphones falling out when running , I 've also noticed this , but it seems to be due to the attached player being jostled , and thus , tugging at the cord . I 've found when I run on a treadmill or machine at the gym , if I put the player on a stationary surface , the cord does not tug and the earphones do not fall out . The set has actually turned out to be quite usable for working out .  
1	  I tried everything but my laptop could not connect the internet . Maybe the problem was with the VISTA OS , but the company offered no fix .  
2	  I live in a bottom floor apartment on the end of the building away from Direct TV transmitters . When I prepared for the switch to DTV , I installed a converter box from Radio Shack along with a DTV antenna . It worked , but not reliably due to the nature of DTV signals being better in ' line of sight ' applications , low gain , and disruption when people move around in the room . I had to constantly adjust the antenna , which was pretty directional in it 's design . I had to admit I made a poor choice in my haste to switch . I looked around for an alternative and found the DB2 . Yes , it is an outdoor antenna , and I cannot install it outside at my apartment , but it turns out to be livable . I have it mounted on the post of an old torchiere lamp near the TV . The reason I bought it is because of the high gain and Multi Directional nature of the design . It works far better than the last antenna I tried . I don't receive all the signals I could receive if I lived in the top floor closest to the transmitters , but the channels I receive are solid , clear pictures without needing to move the antenna all over the place . I also suggest that if you have any understanding of the nature of analog broadcast signals , that you look up the nature of digital broadcast signals . They are different in performance and may help you understand what to do to increase the quality of your receiving installation , especially if your are in a fringe area . The DTV website was very helpful to me .  
2	  This battery holds a charge and works just like the original one that came with the camera - very happy so far !  
1	  No instructionsDisplay shut down before I could get things tuned in and would not activate again until unplugged for a while . Finally started playing poorly over radio with volume way up . Then started engine and heard nothing but static .  
1	  It Works but is dificult to open and close .  
2	  This is the first real pair of binoculars I have ever purchased . As soon as I took them out of the box I was impressed by the clarity . They are very easy to focus with the single knob in the center of the sight lenses . The rubberized coating makes them highly tactile . I am planning on using them for hunting so I was interested in finding a pair that were water and fog proof . The compact size was also a major buying point . I could easily read the liscense plate on a neighbors car from over 150 yrds . May update after more field use but so far .. great buy !  
2	  This is a great device to have if you have a laptop , tablet , ect . Only sugestion I have is to make the prongs retractible so it fits better in my tablet bag ?  
1	  As others have pointed out , the WAN side of this linksys box constantly crashes . If you do not host servers inside the firewall and don't need VPN , then this works OK . But there are products that can do what you need for half the price . If you host servers , be ready for constant disconnects : this linksys is a time wasting piece of junk . In addition to constant WAN crashes , you 'll also have to deal with documented bugs that linksys refuses to fix .  
2	  I bought my Elan IIe with quartz dating about a month ago and I haven't had one bad photo . I used my tax refund , and it was a smart buy . I thoroughly researched all kinds of SLR cameras of the same class ( mid price , semi-advanced ) and found this one to be the best choice for me . Ironically , it was the first one of over ten that I looked at . I kept going back to it for so many reasons . Trust me , this is a great camera . I am a small town newspaper editor , and this camera lets me get great photos of everything from PTA meetings to fiery car crashes .  
2	  HP software has long driven me crazy . Hp hardware , on the other hand , almost always works well . My Designjet 130NR was a reasonably priced solution for a small design office . The ink cartridges last a long time . Good product .  
1	  When at first you don't succeed try again ? Well I shouldn't have in this case . I purchased this particular headset twice . Not very smart of me . I have purchased Bose headphones four times . This particular AE headset twice , and they have both broken on me the same way to the point where they couldn't be used at all . The first issue was the cord . The cloth cover over the wire started bunching up in three places , where a loop of wire protruded out of holes where the cloth would separate . Inside the cloth , the wire was covered by another sheath of rubber . So I had three loops of wire sticking out of the cloth covered cord . This was irritating . This was not what made it unusable in both instances though . It was the plastic that connected both left and right headphones of the headset that started initially with a crack from basic usage , that ended with break . My second set did the very same thing , starting with the issue of the cord , and ending with the crack and total break of the headset . The sound wasn't that great for the price I paid . I could actually get a better sound for the price with a pair of Sony headset . So , this headphone did not live up to the purported Bose name , a total sham .  
1	  I bought this kit for my 06 sonata . Big mistake , I tried to install this scosche kit and my single din head unit wouldnt even fit in the hole . I had to trim the edges to get it to fit . The box just barely clips in so if you push too hard it falls back a little . I couldnt stand the way it fit so I trashed it and bought a metra kit . Couldnt be happier with it . It 's actually made to fit your car , no universal crap . So do yourself a favor and spend the extra couple dollars to buy a metra kit so that it fits the right way with no hassle .  
1	  As stated by the previous comments , apparently what they ship is the incorrect cartridge of PGI-9PM . It appears lighter pink on the box and is made for Canon PIXMA Pro9500 Photo Printer , not the MX7600 . A bit inconvenient to not be able to print still , but Amazon did say they would research this and they promptly issued me a credit for the return .  
2	  These work just fine for being outside or walking in the city and cutting down some noise . I really wonder about some of these reviewers .. what exactly do you expect to get for $ 15 ? Give me a break .  
1	  The FE-180 seams to have a major problem with the picture quality in this camera . A review at CNET says the pictures are soften but that 's a politely way to say fuzzy . I took over 100 pictures indoor , outdoor close up far off and in some shots the pictures are clear but non of them are sharp . I got a lot of out of focus shots and tried using the digital stabilizer mode called DIS which is really effective in low light scenarios . But I could never get a sharp picture . Another issue I have is that after you take a picture it only stays in the display for about 1 second . If I want to view the picture I have to switch to the viewing mode , making sure my subjects were looking at me . I returned it getting the Canon Powershot SD600 which works perfect ; it 's worth the extra cost to take pictures that last a lifetime .  
1	  I had these less than a month , and while happy with the sound , they constantly , like other reviewers , forced my Ipod into pause mode . Also the right headphones gave out completely due to a short in the jack . Less than a month ! Come on !  
2	  I have had this printer for the past 11 months and is perfect for my home office . I have had no problems getting this to work with Mac , XP , and Vista operating systems . Print quality is excellent . Scan quality is excellent . Having a networked printer is fantastic and I 'll never own a non-networked printer after owning this . In the 11th month my printer started making a loud grinding noise . I called Brother support and a new printer was shipped out . I wish other companies had product support as good as Brother 's . All in all , great printer . I 'm very happy with mine .  
2	  I 'm completely satisfied with my Sangean pocket radio . Getting it at such a good price on Amazon made the purchase even more satisfying .  
2	  This case is compact and stores my player and cords very nicely . For what I use it for it is great . I would buy another if I needed to .  
1	  The software will not install on my Dell Precision 450 workstation so all of the extra keys are unavailable . I am unimpressed with the keyboard but , I am sure , I will eventually learn to deal with it . What is the greater disapointment is the mouse ; quite honestly I could aim a flashlight easier . The pointer is sloppy and inacurate and after using the mouse for a few hours there are times when the right button quits respondinding . If I put the USB dongle in a slot on the back of the computer , the keyboard and mouse quit responding , so I 'm stuck with the dongle up front . I am using the mouse keyboard to write this review and the mouse is absolutely frustrating at how inacurate it is . And to add insult to injury , Amazon dropped the price within hours of purchase .  
1	  This product does not work with a Mac . It is advertized that it does , but that is not true . I called TAO electronic . This is very frustrating .  
2	  By itself .. it 's a " meh " player . I bought it with Rockbox in mind , contacted the seller first to make sure it was a v1 . Installed Rockbox and an 8GB microSDHC card ( you can only use a 2GB non-HC card with the original firmware ) , and I 'm good to go ! Rockbox ftw .  
2	  I came from using a ( rather disappointing ) JVC model that failed to adjust to light , so I was a little apprehensive when I saw another digital video camera model . I couldn't have been more surprised when I got the package open how sharp and well-lit the picture was . It really is a fabulous little deal for anyone that wants to chronicle their lives .  
1	  The mouse feels great in my hand , but after 8 months of normal business use , the left-click has pretty much died . If I pound on the button hard enough , it might click 2 out of 5 times . For the amount of money spent on this mouse , I 'd have to say that it 's not really worth it . I now have remapped the smaller thumb button to click , until my new mouse arrives .  
1	  don't bother with this . As mentioned before , the rubber from the cup melted onto the windshield . It took forever for me to get the darn thing off the windshield . After getting it off , I still had to used a razor blade to get the rest of the black rubber off the glass . And there is still a slight black circle there . This happened in April in Michigan . I will admit , before it melted , the location and flexibilty of the mount was great .  
1	  Had this card for about a year , and it worked well until 2 days ago . I had it in my Nikon D5000 and got the error , " Unable to Format Card . Card May Be Defective . " Luckily I found a utility online to recover the pictures I had and I was able to re-format the card . It worked for another day and now I 'm getting the error again . I tried cleaning the contacts w / a cotton swab , and even tried inserting the card while locked & unlocked - didn't make a difference . Hopefully , theSanDisk 16GB Extreme - SDHC Class 10 High Performance memory card ( SDSDX3-016G-P31 , Retail Packaging ) - NEW 30MB / s versionI just bought will last longer .  
1	  When I purchased this item , I asume that it has a usb protal to connect to my laptop . But it turns out to be a mistake . The portal it has can only be connected to a desktop . They returned my money , but I still feel that they should have made it clear in the discription .  
2	  This is a very good camera for the money . Great image , very easy set-up , very compatible with all online messenger services . Logitech just needs to work a little more on the white balance , and this cam would be the best .  
1	  I am absolutely furious and have returned the product for a replacement . I bought it on Saturday around lunch . Loaded a few over 1000 songs on it . That 's what ? 1/7th of advertised capacity ? In any case , I 'd decided on this model becuase I really won't listen to 20,000 songs in one day and didn't need the extra capacity . On Sunday , I played 12 songs and it froze up , then started playing again . I thought that was odd but okay , maybe it was just the song . On the 19th song , it froze . Forevermore . I sync 'd it up and was told it was corrupted and I needed to RESTORE . I hit RESTORE and it said it couldn't find the source . Okay , so I spent that much money to listen to 19 songs ? And I 've been assured that I should get a service agreement because it probably will have lots of these " frozen " moments after the first 30 days . Not that I 'm happy at all with that answer , but IT FAILS within 24 hours ?  
2	  I am a first time buyer of a CB radio and did quite a bit of research on them . For the comparision of features to value this is the best radio that I found . The main features that drove me to this model was that it has squelch , gain and weather features . Not to mention it is very nice to have the backlit knobs at night . It installed very easily and works well for my needs . I have it installed in my Dodge Ram 3500 , for recreational purposes only . I use it for trips with the family and talking with some other buddys that have CB 's in their trucks . I am not sure how this radio stacks up for commercial drivers but for someone that is using it as a hobby or just wants to monitor trucks , weather and general conversation while on trips it can not be beat , in my mind . I would recommend this radio and I would buy it again . The only down side that I have found is that the Mic . seems a little cheap compared to the radio unit itself . This is not a big deal and I will use the Mic . until it breaks , then upgrade to a little better Mic . All in all a good buy and quality product ! Todd  
1	  Not loud and very scratchy ! No louder than my laptop speakers . Not worth it .  
1	  I bought this laptop about 2 years . But after 2 years my dardisk , keyboard and battery was damaged . I ask the support but dont have anything . Very very :-( ( ( ( ( (  
1	  I played with the angles and adjustments for several days with little success . I live in an apartment building in DC surrounded by other tall buildings . Perhaps this antenna is not really meant for such surroundings . I ended up getting cable after all for the little TV watching I do and connecting the antenna to my radio , which works very well .  
2	  the i-pod works very nicely . No problems . The only reason I stopped using it was for a bigger one . I bought an 80gb . Otherwise this one is very nice .  
1	  I ordered the bag for the mbp 17 and it was horrible . the " protection " area could have fit 3 of my computer . it was swimming around ! no protection at all . I ordered it from radtech , and they were rude , mean , nasty people who don't stand by thier product . don't believe anything they say .  
1	  When my adapter for my Compaq laptop started going south , I looked online for a replacement . I shied away from the cheap adapters because of warnings from other customers that they broke too quickly . After shopping , I settled on this adapter which I got for ~ 60 bucks . It 's a piece of junk . It is less durable than those cheap adapters and after only four months of use it is not rechargin unless I bend the wire in the absoutely perfect position . I could have gotten 15 of the cheap adapters and bet that at least one will work better than this turkey .  
2	  The product shipped on time and the product is just as good as advertised . The card is fairly fast and works very well on my A200 . The only negative point was the ship tracking ( USPS ) that was not available until the product was actually delivered ( when I didn't need it anymore ) .  
1	  While they worked , they seemed to be good headphones - I 'm no audiophile , but I could probably tell if they were really poor quality . They lasted about 4-5 months , until no sound would come out of the left ear unless the cord was bent near the jack to temporarily undo a short . I decided to see if I could fix it myself , so I cut open the jack and resoldered all the connections . Unfortunately , the left side lead ended up being shorted to ground , so I was only getting right side audio . I worked my way up the cord to see if I could find where the short originated from , and that lead me all the way into the earpiece . Opening up the left ear , I found where the wires were soldered to the microphone , and using a multimeter , I found that the two solder areas were shorted somewhere within the microphone assembly . TL ; DR - the left channel audio was shorted inside the left earpiece , which is clearly a manufacturer defect . Even at such a good value , I expect headphones to last more than 5 months under light use .  
2	  This unit must have a hole drilled through the bottom of your boat . Make sure your boar does not have any brace or any type of re-enforcment in the area you are drilling . The unit makes it easy to keep the transducer level when you are installing . Use care in cutting the plastic block keep it very smooth and use a good type sealant both outside and inside of the boat . The unit works fine .  
1	  And Palm 's support is non-responsive if not non-existent . The management at Palm must feel that they have too many customers at this point in time . Apparently , to thin down their once loyal customer base they have foisted this aberration onto the market and still refuse to support it . I commend Palm if this is indeed their new strategy as it has worked perfectly in guaranteeing that I will never , ever be a future Palm customer .  
1	  Apparently there 's some kind of driver incompatibility problem when trying to use an HP Cxi 820 printer , via this ( or any other ) conversion cable . I haven't been able to resolve it .  
2	  I am so pleased with this product . I bought a Toshiba LCD last Black Friday ( 2008 ) and it sat in the box for over a year . Around the Christmas holiday I decided that I needed to use my tv and started looking at HDMI cables for the Samsung DVD player I was buying ( it doesn't have s-output ) . I saw this cable and decided it couldn't hurt to give it a try ( it was less than $ . 50 ) . I have been so happy with the quality of my picture . The quality is great and I don't feel like I just got ripped off for paying an obscene amount for something that isn't even the main part of my entertainment experience .  
2	  Audio cables not long enough , or not terminating as you want or need for a project ? Here is the answer !  
1	  UPDATE : DO NOT BUY ! ITS NOT RELIABLE , COULD BE DANGEROUS ! One of my two units fried after only a few months . I suspect the tranformer had a short in it . The transformer got so hot the hard plastic enclosure melted . Too hot to touch . This was in a cool 55 degF room . Luckily it didn't burn my house down . I can no longer access the HDD from my home file serve . Hopefully , it didn't damage the HDD itself , still testing . Unfortunately its past Amazon 's the 30 days return policy . - original reviewAmazon part of purchase was OK , typical Amazon transaction . I bought two units , have both units working great . I 'm happy now , BUT .. product is bargain priced , you get what you pay for . CONS : - Installation is for the mechanically inclined and PC h / w component savy . Package is absent any instructions on how to open the case and physically install your hard drive . Its like a puzzle box . A user could easily be frustrated or even break components installing their HDD . - Internal cabling is stiff and space is cramped , could easily cause a connector , wire or cable to be loose or even break during installation . - I had two units , each with different parts which fit poorly . AFTER I knew how to open the case , I had a corner on a plastic part break off opening the second unit because the front cover fit so tightly ( must have been forced on in the factory ) . Fortunately , no adverse impact . PROS : - As for final operation , the aluminum case w / HDD installed runs cool , even cooler than the power transformer . - Price very low , notably cheaper than comparable products . - Comes with free external SATA cable , half the price of the product if bought seperate . - Comes with convienent free screw driver for assembly . Would I buy again ? For home use , YES to save money , recession and all . For business / customer / relative , NO for fear / risk of time delays if product needs returned , reliability & customer satisfaction .  
2	  Not much to say about a digital cable . It was a good price and it works . I use it to connect a MacBook ( with mini DVI adapter ) to a 20.1 " Sceptre X20G-Naga LCD ( which is beautiful by the way ) .  
1	  Its ok but unit wont fit in it with anny attachments , should be larger and cushioned  
1	  This item was listed as an accessory for an Olympus digital point and shoot camera that does not accept this memory card . Amazon linked it incorrectly . You 're better off shopping for this in person or from your camera 's manufacturer directly , like I 'm going to have to do .  
1	  Since a photo has not been posted yet ( as of 3/18/02 ) I did some research on this model on the Panasonic website . This product does not have an LCD screen so if you are looking for a portable player with monitor , this is not for you .  
1	  I tested the Advent AW770 , Advent AW720 and the RCA WHP160 headphones . The audio quality was comparable on all 3 .. but the Advent phones each had drawbacks . The Advent phones had to be manually tuned to the right frequency . That was just too big a pain in the xx for me . These , the AW770 , had the tuning knob and the volume knob right next to each other ( and of course you can't see them unless you take off the phones ) , so you could accidentally detune when you meant to adjust the volume . I recommend the RCA WHP160 phones in this price range .  
2	  We purchased this camera to use for our wedding and honeymoon . We love the fact that it takes both pictures and video . The pictures are clear and the video looks great . We would definitely recommend this camera to others . Also , the price was awesome !  
1	  I bought this camera when it was on-sale thinking that most webcams were alike . What a disappointment . The camera is extremely blurry and stutters when in low light conditions . During the daylight it works OK , but at night when my room is just lit by two lamps the video turns into a slide show . I previously had a different camera that I donated to my parents so they could video chat with their granddaughter . That other camera worked much better in the same lighting conditions . I tried downloading the latest drivers , adjusting the settings , etc . Either the video is way too dark or it 's way too blurry . If you shoot video in non-daylight conditions , I would be weary of this one . On the plus side , the microphone works very well . As good as or better than my standalone USB mic .  
2	  I have had this headset for 3 or 4 months and it is working well . - Update 6/20/2006 - I still have this unit . I have lost the little foam mic cover , but it still works great . It has held up well . - Update 7/18/2006 - Well , The headset finally bit the dust . It made it a little less than 6 months . It broke at the slide area . I am opting to replace it with a Platronics M175 . This unit is a little more expensive , but it is convertible between and over the head and over the ear model and has a noise canceling mic . All in all the unit was woth the $ 10.99 I paid in February .  
1	  Despite the Tom Tiede 's smiling face on the dust jacket of the copy of this book I got from the library , his book is an unkind , trivializing , and ultimately bitter dismissal of a genre of work that he only partly understands . Yes , there are many more self-help books than we really need . Yes , authors make more money on them than is reasonable . Yes , looking carefully at the self-help industry is a good idea . But do we need this book ? Should he be making money on it ? Has he taken a careful look ? No , no , and no . The author does show some insight into particular self-help writers , and like I said the industry needs examination , but he has a hard time expressing his insight without insults and smug scorn . I think Tiede gives his reason for writing this book in the last chapter : bitterness at feeling no longer at home in his chosen profession , journalism , and at the rejection of the work he tried to do with the newspaper he ran . It 's a pity that he chose to express his bitterness this way .  
2	  I have an old second hand 6210 Officejet printer that has been printing poorly , although the cartridge is not that old . Taking a chance , I ordered this cartridge for it . I installed this today , and it functions perfectly . HP brand , HP packaging , excellent print quality .  
1	  I spent over 4 hours trying to install this product , to no avail . I am knowledgable about networking ( an amateur , but I know what I am doing ) and simply could not get this to work . The documentation , which you WILL need , is insufficient and the setup is extremely complicated . If you download the most recent firmware and admin software from Hawking 's site , you will get a wizard which seems very good . According to the wizard , everything was fine . The only problem is that my printer , a Konica Minolta PagePro 1350W , would not print a page , period . I wonder if the printer is simply incompatible . Bottom line is that this product is not ready for prime time . PC World magazine rated this print server as an Editor 's Choice , which is why I bought it . DO NOT BE FOOLED . You are rolling the dice here . Some people have been able to get it to work , and I imagine it 's a real boon for them ( it would have been for me ) , but you are taking a risk . So please be aware of that before you buy this product . If you are a pro with lots of time on your hands ( which I imagine the people at PC Magazine are ) , maybe you should give this a shot but otherwise it 's too big a risk of wasting your time . I suspect there is a reason this print server is so much cheaper than those of the competition ( I got mine for around $ 90 , a lot of comparable ones are $ 140 or so ) .  
2	  this is great seller with good product and prompt shipping and will order from them again . headphones used for my laptop for noise blockage while listening to voices while watching video or movies . good headphones . most small headphines cannot get good connection at jack . this one works great .  
1	  Save your time , save your money look at an IPod or SanDisk instead .  
2	  The red , brushed metallic color goes great with the red Deft Dante rotating case for my kindle fire . The rubber nib is softer than any stylus I 've found and is read the best by my kf . It is very light weight as a whole . This is the second BoxWave I 've bought . The reviews for other stylus ' talked about the insert for the headphone jack and was one reason I bought this model . The insert is plastic and pops in and out easily . My second insert is smashed flat on one side , but still works . I can always use the side clip too .  
2	  I 've done my homework on these phones , and the one thing I 've heard is that every pair seems to be different . According to some sites , V-Moda has a reputation of changing the freq curve of different models , sometimes on a production to production basis . That said , it 's half the reason I bought these - I like a company that has that much devotion to making a good product . When I first received them , they didn't sound worth the 85 bucks I paid for them . They were pretty good in the bass department but seemed average everywhere else , comparable to a pair of bad Sony EX-71 's . I put them away after a few songs , and when I came back to them they were the worst sounding phones I 've ever heard . The bass was muddy , the mids were muddier , and the highs were unlistenable . It sounded like an AM transmission . However , if you 're looking into buying in-ear canalphones you should be aware that every pair must incur a burn-in period , in which the phones level themselves out and the magnets stretch their muscles . After about 6 hours of burn time ( just put your mp3 player on shuffle for a while ) , the Vibes sound GREAT . The bass thumps , the mids are very cool , but the thing that truly strikes my fancy is the control in the highs . I do like my bass but it seems most of the time companies spend more time working on bass and forgetting about highs . If I listen to a pair of " true " Shure e2c 's or Etymotic er-6i 's , the " honest " highs are too shrill . With the Vibe pair , you 're still getting a noticeable difference between a high and a mid but the high has a very mild , west-coast , laid back feel to it . A shredding solo isn't painful to listen to . Everything on these phones fit my style perfectly . However , if you 're expecting a pair of phones that will TRULY represent every high on every song , don't get these . Some other cool things : - That fruity-looking gold bag was actually black , which is a very nice touch . - The phones feel extremely comfortable in my ear ; more comfy than the unprecedented ex-71 . - The cord is the perfect length . The only setbeck , so far , is the cord itself . The red cord is protected in rubber , but it doesn't feel good against the skin . Also , it isn't very good plastic ; it is comparable to the plastic companies use to protect speaker wire .  
1	  The batteries are really bad , they don't hold charge for nothing , I can take less than 10 pictures . The charge won't hold the battery properley . poor design .  
2	  This product works exactly as expected . Amazingly , nowhere in the product description is the color indicated , but by looking at the picture I was able to surmise that it 's black . The item I received is , in fact , black ! It 's described as a " Longitudinally slit , flexible plastic " . It is , in fact , flexible plastic and by golly it does have a cut going all along its length . According to the product bullet points , it 's " perfect for the keyboardist . " I am not a keyboardist , but I found it to be perfect for me too ! So I think the seller should be somewhat more general in describing who this black flexible tube would be perfect for . In all seriousness , this is a simple product and it works fine . The only problems I would expect from something like this is the plastic being too thin so as to kink when bent or the plastic chipping . It has done neither of those things to me . Comparatively , it seems priced well too ( I paid $ 12.26 for 10 feet on September 16 , 2012 . )  
2	  Good piece of equipment . I haven't used the PC interface , but the power cable works great on my motorcycle . Hooked up to the Garmin e-trex , it sure saves on batteries .  
2	  I 'm not going to mark the product way down for not working because I still haven't figured out whether its something in my computers software or if its the Hardware of the card itself . When I first installed the wireless card it was working perfectly , getting full speed and great range , playing PC games over the internet was not a problem , nor was downloading torrents or just daily web browsing . However I moved my computer closer to the router and plugged it in directly and from that point on , my wireless card has not worked . Even when I unplug the hard line the card doesn't show up in Windows , I should mention that the card does still light up , even when windows doesn't recognize it . As I said before , I won't penalize this because I 'm not sure whos to blame , it could have very well been some sort of Windows Update that caused the issue just as much as a hardware failure . I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-Bit on a brand new custom built computer . I can't stress this enough that when this card was working for me , it was brilliant . Extremely fast and very easy to install , and the range was amazing . EDIT : After re-installing windows ( and trying it in another computer ) the card works perfectly again .  
1	  I bought this card after reading many positive reviews on Amazon . I 'm about to return it after a week of unsuccessfully getting it to work in my environment . I tried the card in a Dell Inspiron 8100 running Windows XP Professional , communicating with my Linksys WAP11 . The main problem is that it takes many attempts before the card actually connects to the Linksys access point , and no sequence of steps will get it to reconnect reliably . I am using the latest SMC driver and utility from the SMC website .. After digging through the SMC online FAQ , I noticed that they recommend you disable WEP ( encryption ) if you 're not using an SMC-brand access point . Disabling WEP did help a few times in getting connected , but it didn't make any lasting difference . Regardless , what 's the point of having this card if they recommend against using WEP with a different AP provider ? What kind of interoperability is that ? Also , SMC makes no reference to actually supporting Windows XP with this card . Digging deeper revealed that this card is NOT WiFi-certified ( just check the online WiFi-compliant hardware list ) , nor does SMC advertise WEP support anywhere in their in product data sheet . Their meager 128-bit encryption configuration can only use the 1st out of 4 encryption keys anyway . In contrast , the Cisco Aironet 350 PC card I 've used here on a similar laptop has worked perfectly . The Aironet integrates better with Windows XP control panels , is WiFi certified , and has absolutely no issues getting connected to the Linksys WAP - you turn on the laptop and it 's connected . I plan on replacing the SMC card with an Agere Orinoco Gold PC card , which is also WiFi-certified , supports 128-bit WEP , and is XP-compatible ..  
2	  what can be said , this does what it says it will do .. period . bottom line , i only bght 3 , wish i had bght more , and will do when again on sale .  
1	  First of all , this device is incompatible with Windows Vista . This shouldn't really come as a surprise , as Microsoft 's new OS tripped up more than a few of my devices . Essentially , since the software / Turtle Beach driver package won't work , it simply functions as a speaker jack . If you have need of a $ 30 USB speaker jack that asks you to install it every time your computer is booted up , I have the product for you . It looks as if Turtle Beach will not be releasing Windows Vista drivers , meaning those of us who upgraded are pretty much out of luck . This would be excusable if the device actually functioned , however . Again , the Vista compatibility issues are MS ' problem [ mostly ] , not Turtle Beach 's . The reviews stated that even with MS ' generic audio drivers , the Turtle Beach is a step above integrated sound . This is false ; the sound that is emitted from the card is simply abominable . Scratchy , hissy and distorted are the first words that come to my mind . It 's unfortunate , too , because the treble / mid-range seemed spot on in the Red Hot Chili Peppers ' " Snow ( Hey Oh ) " . The static being emitted from my speakers / headphones ( I tested with both ) was just too much , though . Think AM radio and you have the picture . The bass was absolutely horrendous and tinny sounding - essentially ever drum blast sounded high pitched and empty sounding , as if someone was tapping a can . Save your $ 30 and put them towards something else . A weak effort from Turtle Beach .  
1	  First let me say that I am a computer expert . I have been using Vista since the beta version , and I actually like it . I have also been testing Windows 7 , which is similar to Vista , but is supposed to need less computer resources and be MORE compatible . I love this printer on Vista with a USB connection . The network connection was a bit slow but the USB was great . The colors are incredible for a laser printer . I am a Realtor and do a LOT of printing . With this printer I can print my own fliers , which saves on printing costs . I 've owned the printer less than a year . HP has no intention of supporting this printer on Windows 7 64bit . So , now that I 've spent hours upgradding my main computer , not to mention hundreds of dollars for Windows 7 , I 've learned that my best printer is NOT compatible . So - if you are considering this printer , and there is any chance that you will be converting to Windows 7 - forget it , look elsewhere . By the way AMAZON is awesome - this is NO reflection on them . I am very angry with HP who has decided NOT to write Windows 7 drivers . If you are sticking with Vista or XP then this is a great printer .  
1	  I was traveling in Uganda for a photo shoot . The zipper was only 80 % shut . Due to the nature of the zipper and how it zips all the way around .. all my equipment fell to the ground . I wish there was a lock on the zipper . I 've also had to restitch the inside of the outer pocket .  
1	  very bad hardware . After 4 weeks the router started to hang , and I had to reboot it to unlock it . Now this happens every hour , and anyway when it is working my pages take 5 second to load , slower than dial up and I am on cable . I own and have used lynksis , netgear and belkin , all of them without a problem . I bought smc because of a professional review , but this is bad equipment . Their support is terrible , if you go to their website you cannot even find new or old firmware for this model . of course they don't want to honor the warranty because " it is working " . Stay away !  
2	  Although I haven't purchased a HDTV yet , I needed a combo unit that would fit my current enclosure , function well with my current 32 " Mitsubishi TV and have all the features I 'll need when I do get the new LCD HDTV . Although I 've only watched one DVD and part of a video , I 've been very impressed with this unit . After reading some reviews at Amazon regarding other combo units , I was hesitant to buy one . However , further review of the capabilities of this unit at Panasonic . com really helped . Setup was easier than described in the manual . I had downloaded a . PDF format of the manual at Panasonic . com last week , however I really didn't need to . Setup was that easy . I purchased a Full Screen version DVD I wanted , in order to test the DVD player . Picture and sound were crystal clear . The video I tried was older , but the VCR played it as well as my existing Mitsubishi ( self-cleaning 4-head ) unit . I can't ask for more . I 'll have to try a more current movie next . A note to those with older TV sets . After reading the downloaded manual information , prior to purchase , I had a feeling that this unit might not be completely compatible with my not quite seven year old TV . I was correct . Even after trying both Mitsubishi codes provided , it has most but not all functions . Although it 's a little disappointing , I would gladly buy this unit again just because of all the great things it does do !  
1	  Performance of the one I bought is pretty good . But I encountered couple of problems : 1 . The hand rest surface ( and most of the outer surface ) is coated with a fine porous silver color material . After about 2 months of use , the silver color of the hand touching areas changed to dark gray getting closer to light black ( may be this porous coating reacts with sweat ) . Now the laptop is about 8 months old and very ugly looking because of the big dark gray spots here and there . And they won't go away even though I tried to clean . Given that I am used to travel with the laptop , this does not please me . 2 . And in a place near the space tab , the coating just went away showing the underneath white color plastic like material . 3 . Couple of days ago , two keys stopped working ( Left CTRL key and the one with tidle ) . But I guess this is common in all laptops . I am yet to get this fixed . For about 3 years in the past , I was using a black color Dell Latitude C600 . I didn't encounter problems like this and it worked very well . Even though the speed was around 850MHz , my Linux installation was performing fast ( It was faster than an HP Presario 2500 with a 2.6 GHz Celeron processor - I ran some benchmark tests )  
1	  As has been stated , the spacebar is harder to push than other keys and significantly louder . I purchased it despite seeing these complaints because someone commented that he thought it had been fixed . It has not as of 12/8/2011 . It 's quite disappointing to see Microsoft not bothering to fix this one glaring issue on one of the most used keys . It was probably worth a shot to try a cheap alternative to the ~ $ 100 goldtouch / kinesis keyboards I had been buying but in my case it didn't end well > . >  
2	  This is probably one of the cheapest noise reduction headphones out there . It won't do the job of a Bose , but you could buy 8 Boses for the price of a pair of these headphones . The noise reduction isn't perfect , because these headphones don't press really hard on the ears to form a tight seal like the Bose does . However , this also means that these headphones are a good deal more comfortable . The other plus is that that these headphones fold up nicely into the handy bag provided . Uses one AA battery that lasts about 12 hours or so .  
1	  I bought the MacBook Pro 2.2Ghz in May 2008 with 1600 $ . I was very excited . Usually , laptop performed very well and I enjoyed the MAC OS X ( I work in IT for 9 years with Windows95-Windows7/2003Server-whatever , Linux and now .. Mac OS ) . However : Problems I had in these 3 years : - battery broke : one year max . ; I said , OK , this is normal for all laptops what can I expect , no problem ; then I looked at the price for a new battery and I said ' mehh .. a bit much ' and never bought it . - from time to time after 1.5 years max . , I got grey screens and the screen wouldn't come up ; I needed to try and reboot the laptop multiple times . - overheated when I put an Windows 7 dual boot at some time and found out it 's a Bootcamp driver issue for the FANs or something like it ; the FANs were not spinning at max speed in Windows 7 but only up to 3000-3500rpm ( instead of 6000rpm in Mac OS X ) ; I deleted the Windows 7 and put VMware with Windows 7 in Mac OS X and .. was OK with it . - After 2 years , I couldn't see anything on the screen no matter how many times I tried to boot-up . I took it to an authorized Apple dealer in my country to look at it and I payed around 80 euros for investigation - they said maybe the NVIDIA chipset problem but after further investigation they said it something wrong with the logic board actually but they managed to make it work but they won't guarantee it will last for long ; they offered 3 months of warranty ; it cost me an additional 50Euros for this . - After exactly 3 years , again the same problem , but I moved to different country still in Europe ( Belgium ) ; they told me the investigation costs 85Euros and I payed ; after 5 days they made a report : logic board faulty , total costs 1287 Euros ! Now , I ask you , any smart guy out there , who the hell will pay for this ? And why should I buy ever again a MAC ? So many problems , so EXPENSIVE repair ? This is outrageous .. and this was IT for me : I 'll switch to a normal DELL / HP / Whatever laptop instead . Not to mention , that I think this is very well calculated : instead of repairing , buy a new laptop - forced . In conclusion : 1 ) it really doesn't matter what to buy because all the components are the SAME , CHINA made and eventually after max 2-3 years will brake . This is our world today . Just buy a regular laptop with + years of warranty if possible and that 's the best option . 2 ) if you have money to spend , go for it . Sincerely , A Former Customer . PS > I also have an iPhone 4 and wanted to buy MacBook Air because I saw the new technology in it , but after this .. I quit the idea ; it doesn't worth it .  
2	  This is the perfect product for persons wanting to determine power consumption of household appliances .  
1	  I received only the suction cup mount , but not the bracket shown in the picture , my order looks like item 010-10747-00 from Garmin , which is only the mount . This obivously makes the mount useless , since I 'm purchasing this mount to replace one that was stolen . I 'm still trying to figure out if it was a mistake from Amazon , or the item does not come with the bracket . I would rather have purchased this directly from Garmin , since now Amazon is giving me headache and money loss from having to return the item for refund .  
1	  I find that I get better sound quality from the speaker on my iPod touch than I do through these speakers ! The speakers have the sound quality of a cheap clock radio , including the static and tinny sound . It 's not worth keeping this item just to charge my iPod and it has no value as a speaker , as I get better quality just setting the iPod down and listening through the built in speaker . I don't often return items , but will be returning this .  
2	  This power strip is a great idea ! I purchased it as a gift for my father . It 's a nice energy saver , and it 's great to be able to push one button ( in his case , the computer ) and have everything turn on . It works just like I would have expected , and he uses all the time . I may purchase another for me !  
1	  This little player would have been great .. if it worked . I could have easily gotten over the proprietary cord ( though Samsung should sell extras .. ) , easily gotten past the charger situation ( I have a USB charging dock ) but the fact that the player would freeze and took forever to load was a deal breaker . I left it plugged in for a few days , hoping it would " call home " as another reviewer suggested it might .. but it didn't . I tried resetting the thing , that didn't work and then I returned the defective hardware to Amazon ( kudos for accepting the return and prompt credit ) I really don't want an iPod , don't want to use iTunes as I deal with either CD source or MusicGiants ( not a fan of compressed " low def " music on my home stereo ) .. but if the two best runners up are Samsung and Sansa .. both of whose players have major software issues what can one do . People wonder why iPod owns the market , maybe because their stuff works out of the box ( and I was a member of the anything but iPod club who is throwing in the towel and buying an 8 gig Nano to replace my outdated 1 gig Creative ( which is actually still a great runners MP3 .. as long as you have your playlists worked out .. tiny is good and I don't like touching the player during a run anyway ) )  
1	  This little machine seems to be cheaply made . The USB plug in is underneath the scanner bed . Then you have to wrap the cord around and the machine before you can even think about placing the printer in an area near your computer . Plugged it into the computer and the " found new hardware " came up . Went through the process . Error . It failed . ? I followed the de-structions in the book . Still Error . Failed to install . Yet - I could still print . ? Tried it on another computer . Tried a different USB cable . I even tried a different one . ( I have 3 ) . Error . Failed to install the driver .. After trying several different methods to install the printer drivers - including downloading off the internet - I replaced this with a trusty dusty OLD HP printer .  
2	  I 'm not going to write too much about the photographic aspects of this camera - it looks like it 's covered abundantly , and suffice to say the camera is probably beyond the capabilities of most of its owners ( myself included ) . It capable of taking great pictures , suffice to say . I 'm writing partly in response a comment further down about an individual that was experiencing problems with the sensor , and partly thanks to an episode of Survivor Man ( oddly enough , I know ) . I noticed on the Amazon episode of Survivor Man that Les was experiencing difficulties keeping his camera gear dry and working . I returned from the Amazon Rainforest myself just this past July , having spent two weeks in the jungles of Peru with my D200 . I was very pleased with it 's operation - never once did I experience a problem , in fact . Paired with the 28-70 f / 2.8 , I took the camera on a small canoe on the Amazon itself and into the rainforest for extended amounts of time . I took pictures with it on a tripod while a tropical storm poured down from overhead , and I had it in the hot midday sun where the lens became hot to the touch . Again , regardless of the environment I had it in , never once did it even hiccup . Anyway , I thought I could offer a testament to its extreme durability . Part of my interest when purchasing a DSLR was to have a strong , weather-proof design , and the D200 shined admirably .  
1	  I only bought this cable because the price was cheaper . & # 34 ; you get what you paid for & # 34 ; that 's exactly what i got . The cable does not stream very good when i connect from my laptop to my 40 & # 34 ; Samsung TV . The movie or anything that i am watching would just black out every 2 min or so . It is so frustrating . i am not satisfied at all . All the stores i checked had very expensive cables . For 25ft it is very good price actually for the frustration is not worth . so i am just gonna have to buy from one of the stores .  
2	  I 've had these Etymotic earphones for about a year now , and have loved them . But now , they 've suddenly become an incredibly hot commodity because they 're just about the only decent earphone I 've found that works with my iPhone . If you 're having trouble finding an earphone that works with your new iPhone , look no further . Clear , true sound - you won't believe how well you can hear with these if you 've been using a noise cancelling earphone - make sure you get a good seal with the ear tip - you really have to put it fairly deep into the ear , but you will be amazed by the experience .  
2	  Simple installation . No hassles . Works like a champ .  
2	  Yes it does cost a bit more than a standard splitter , but well worth it . My wife and I can listen to the same MP3s now and she can have the sound adjusted exactly as she likes it . I am probably going to buy some more of these to use at my computer to split the sound to my monitor speakers and my good speakers . Very good deal and a perfect product .  
1	  Both cartridges arrived in a dry state and would not print properly . Would not recomend product . Was not worth the aggravation . Perhaps another company can do better .. Email was sent to company 3 days ago no response I guess they dont like happy customers .  
1	  I absolutely sang the praises of these earphones . The noise cancellation on airplanes is amazing . I couldn't have been happier .. untilLast 5 hour flight to Hawaii , I open them up and realize that the tiny pieces of plastic that hold them together to rotate , 3 out of the 4 pieces were broken . Only one was in my bag . So , two had previously broken off and gone by the wayside . I spent the whole ride having to search for this tiny piece of black plastic the size of a grain of rice every time it fell out . They have a year warranty and I have owned them for about a year and two months . You really let me down this time Targus .  
1	  This design didn't pull enough heat away from my Sony VAIO laptop that always ran hot - not sure anything in production now would work perfectly , but I know this one didn't .  
1	  I bought my husband this item for Christmas from Sears . We had the same exact problem as Jefsav had with his . My husband used the recorder four times , and after he ejected the disk the last time , the unit shut itself off , never to be powered up again . We took the unit back to Sears and although it had been under the Christmas tree and not in use , they said we had " had it too long " to give us a refund so they replaced it with the exact same model . After exactly four uses , it did the same thing . This time we took it back and got a refund since we had only had this one for a week and there wasn't much hope of a third one working any better .  
1	  THsi item did not work at all . I bought it for a trip to Italy , lugged it all the way over there and it did not work - the pushout plugs would not stay engaged . I borrowed an adapter from the front desk and it worked fine . You probably do not need a transformer product like this as most devices you will want to use are already dual voltage ( computer , phone , rechargable camera batteries , etc . ) Just buy a plug adaptor and you will be fine .  
1	  I actually have the Protron 32 " LCD TV which I purchased from QVC . com . I must admit I shouldn't have jumped on the LCD wagon so soon , because this version does not have the HDMI port and actually took some muscle to disconnect it from its stand . I 've had this unit now for 2 years , and compared to other LCD models , the resolution is not so great , many of days I 've spent trying to adjust the color / resolution but to no avail . Plus it irritates me that while channel surfing it takes several seconds before the picture actually appears .  
1	  No where does the info for this product does it state that it does NOT play HD-DVD discs .. Therefore the info provided is not complete .. If your looking for both the ability to play HD-DVD discs and up grade to near HD DVD , This is NOT the player you should be looking at . Also , if you want to be able to get other remotes to work with this product , they do not have their codes with larger manufactures so they can be incorporated . The unit itself plays back great , but impossible to integrate with other manufactures equipment .. Better spend 30-50 $ more not to suffer the inconvenience .  
2	  This order arrived in the condition as advertised , and within the time period promised . I would gladly deal with this vendor again in the future !  
1	  The printer works great with my computer running XP SP1 , but is not compatable with a newer computer running XP or any of my laptops that are running Vista . The fact that this printer is NOT Vista compatible should be highlighted .  
1	  I love logitech keyboards . They are the only keyboards I ever buy for my several computers at home . I 've been wanting an ergonomic keyboard for a long time , but when I received this one I had a lot of trouble with the spacebar sticking . So , I figured it was a defect and I returned it for a replacement . The spacebar on the second one also sticked . I tried to see if I would be able to live with it because I really like the logitech keyboards and I really wanted the ergonomic one , but it was super annoying , especially when using Linux . There was no way I could use this keyboard .  
2	  Item arrived much faster than time promised and in excellent condition . Nothing to put together . Performs very well . What fun copying our old albums to CD . Also fun to play some of them again . It fits into our living room nicely , looking like a piece of furniture . For stereo afficianados , the speakers probably wouldn't be sufficient but you can add on to the unit .  
2	  I 've been fooling with various cartridge-based printers for years , always saying someday I would get another LaserJet . I paid $ 3700 for my first one in the early Eighties . So I 've been thinking a laser would cost quite a bit more than the cartridge based printers . They do , but when you can buy a printer as good as this ML-2010 for about the same as a cartridge printer , there is no longer any reason to mess around . I 've had the printer for about three weeks . It installed effortlessly , operates effortlessly , produces beautiful results and is a joy to use . It has not caused the slightest problem . Mine is for home use and just may be the last printer I ever buy , unless at some point I buy a color laser .  
1	  Picture shows a fan labelled " ball bearing " ; description says " This replacement ball bearing fan " . This fan is plastic on plastic-NO BALL BEARINGS , not even a sleeve bearing .  
1	  Don't do it . I have one and it doesn't do half the things they claim . And HP just discontinued the printer and shipped the support over seas .  
1	  This is the worst modem I ever have , I will give it 0 if I can . 1 . The driver totally doesn't work on Win2K , simply didn't dial ( query modem looks fine ) and froze the machine . 2 . Incredible unstable connection , on Win98 , 80 % chance you got 14.4Kb with this so called " V. 92 " ! My phone line is perfect , my laptop and my old ISA modem all get 50K + consistently . 3 . No manual , no support . Don't touch this garbage . I get a $ 15 no name modem and works perfectly .  
1	  My stepdaughter had her mind made up that she needed to have this Barbie MP3 player for her happiness . I highly suspect that her stepsisters convinced her that this was the truth . After seeing one in person I couldn't really bring myself to spend over $ 50 on this cheap trinket . I tried to convince her that another MP3 player would be far more useful and durable , but of course that wasn't the point of this object , was it ? She had already ventured upon the virtual Barbie world online and this also influenced her choice / need . Upon opening would not function and had to send back after customer service determined the base must be faulty . This christmas present is still not replaced as of 1/20/2008 . I am hopeful for a positive result but what a hassle for junk . Mattel has been great about not adding any additional cost for me like shipping , but I did have to print the shipping label and spend time to have it repacked .  
1	  Despite advertising saying this antenna would work with my XM2GO radio , the antenna jack would not fit into the radio . I was able to return the product with no hassle , so I have no complaints other than poor advertising indicating the antenna was compatible with my radio .  
1	  Mine is going back . I can not get it to work . The documentation is useless , and the media server does not work worth a damn . Over an hour on customer support and no one there seems to know how to trouble shoot the device . Control your blood pressuse , Avoid this product !  
2	  I have been a long time video camera user , and this is my first time moving away from using tapes . I could not be happier . No more worring about what tape is in the camera , if it at the right spot . Just pick it up and go . The 7 hours on the best quality it plenty of time and the download to the computer is easy . I love the touch screen controls as well . So far no problems . I did think that the download to the computer would be faster .. could just be my computer because I don't have a USB 2.0 connection , just regular USB . Still , way faster than having to play it in real time , and you don't lose quality .  
1	  The build quality of this product seems to be amiss . The first Jukebox arrived with a bad hard drive . It was returned and the hard drive in the second Jukebox went bad 90 days later , with very little play and zero abuse , i.e. it never left the house , was never dropped , etc . Also , don't expect much in the way of volume , it is just not there . Based on 2 bad hard drives in 3 months , there is no way I can recommend to anyone they purchase this product .  
1	  You would think that a pair of headphones that cost almost $ 100 would last longer than a $ 10 pair , but apparently not . I 've owned the ER6i 's for only a few months now and they suddenly stopped working . No sound comes out of either earpiece except occasional sputtering . I 've taken very good care of these headphones , handling them carefully , keeping them clean , and changing the filters , but I guess that wasn't good enough . I have a pair of $ 10 headphones that I bought almost 2 years ago and these still work just fine while the ER6i is totally useless after just a few months . Absolutely ridiculous .  
2	  I had purchased a cheaper cable , and it was terrible , then I saw this one , and was skeptical about the higher price ( Only like $ 3 more ) and decided to get it . I am yet to say or learn about any negative aspect of this cable , the video output is clear , the cable is of VERY high quality . I repair computers , and needed a vga cable to connect to my monitor , and with my screen 's native resolution of 1900x1200 , this cable displays that resolution ultra clear with no fuzz or lines ! WILL purchase again and recommend !  
2	  .. but TOO crisp sounding ? The treble seems to be set terribly high , you will need to fiddle with your EQ or plain turn down the volume when the track goes into screaming vocals . Other than that , GREAT sound and it looks sweet . Oh , and is less silverish and more greyish than the posted picture ( so its a bit darker )  
1	  A piece junk , did not work for longer than 3 seconds , and it broke before I was able to do anything . I simply threw away $ 32 .  
1	  Tip of car charger gets loose too easily , made in China . Bad experience , would disuade buying Nuvi products . I am asking for 2X $ 26 refund and apology on 2 of my 3 GPS Nuvi product bought in 18 months .  
1	  We ordered the battery brand shown in the photo . We 'd used this brand for our alarm system for the past 15 years . The company sent a different brand that I am not familiar with . They sent LS14250 which I am not familiar with . We have them as back up for when the alarm batteries go out and have not had a chance to use them yet . I will not buy from this particular supplier anymore as they substitute an unknown battery brand for the name brand . If anyone reads this .. BEWARE . 3.6 Volt Lithium Battery  
1	  It appears that the high yield functionality of the # 34 cartridge isn't such a great deal after all . Rather than providing more ink , Lexmark has just dialed down the amount of ink dispensed per print . What comes out crisp black with regular # 24 cartridge appears dull gray with the # 34 ( we compared prints ) . Even worse , the quality settings in the printer software don't allow you to choose higher quality . As if these cartridges weren't already enough of scam now Lexmark will let you pay more for a lower quality product and not even make this difference clear in the product description .  
2	  For my application , I needed this to go around of of those L-shaped Ikea desks . Good solid construction , nothin fancy , basic packaging . Best of all , It does what it supposed to do .  
2	  This is a good quality ball head at a reasonable price . The knobs are very solid , smooth , and easily lock in place allowing the head to support up to 22 lbs . The unit pans smoothly and the small knob in front can be used to set tension on the panning feature or lock it in place . The small knob on the side is for tension control of the ball head , and the large knob is the primary ball release . One of the features that help me to decide on this unit was the tension control feature . However , after using it for a while I can say it 's pretty much unnecessary . The primary locking control knob is very smooth and does not release the ball too quickly . Hence , it 's very easy to control the tension and ball adjustment just from this one knob - and much easier than trying to coordinate the two . I you are considering one of the other Giottos ball heads , and you don't need to support up to 22 lbs , the smaller and lighter MH1002-310 ( which supports up to 13 lbs ) should work just fine without the dedicated tension control knob . Otherwise , this unit is solid and very well built with precision tuning . I 'm also happy with the quick release assembly MH1002-310 ( included ) . It easily snaps into place , and easily comes loose . It also has a safety lever . One note on this , after the unit is snapped into place , you 'll want to push the release lever in to tighten the grip . It will stay snug . If you don't , the camera won't come loose , but could wiggle a little bit .  
2	  I have gone through all types of transmitters from belkin to monster to bargaincell and crzondigital and thus far this coby transmitter has bn the best I have used thus far .. Not staticy , convinient to charge another device in my car and sound is clear .. couldnt have asked for more thank u ^ _ ^  
2	  This radio worked very well within the 1/2 mile range with very clear communication . 1/2 mile to 1 mile was broken but understandable . The main problem with this radio is that one of the two channels are probably being used by someone else due to the unusually strong sales of these radios . We usually were able to switch channels and get uninterrupted communication .  
1	  I had several months worth of important documents on this . I know I should have backed them up elsewhere but I didn't .. and one day this thing stopped lighting up and cannot be recognized by any PC . I looked this up online and it is a known issue . If you don't believe me , then type " cruzer 2gb dead " into Google and see for yourself how there are hundreds of other very unhappy people who tried to go cheap by buying one of these and is now in agony . I only write this review so that other people ( hopefully ) will not have to go through what I did . Instead I would highly recommend the 32GB mini by Corsair , something that accidentally went through the washer and dryer ( and still works perfectly ) ! This product , however , is junk ; I did nothing to provoke its death . It 's also loaded with bloatware which cuts in on the already-measly 2GB . As a final warning , if you go to Sandisk 's official website you 'll see that their forums are loaded with complaints about this , and the only response provided is that " there 's nothing you can do now " and / or " it isn't Sandisk 's fault " . So .. please don't encourage them to keep mass-distributing this faulty product and instead buy something more reliable .  
2	  I have a canon digicam & a dell laptop . The dell has inbuilt SD slot . This SD card works fine with both . I think the speed offered by this is good enough for amateurs . You don't need to pay extra bucks for that ultra II type .  
2	  I bought the Canon CG-300 charger for a trip to Europe . I have a Canon DC40 camcorder . It worked great ! I was afraid of charging the camcorder battery directly ( in the camcorder ) due to the electrical voltage difference and liked having this option . It charged both my primary and back up battery quickly and I am very happy with my purchase .  
1	  I recently bought one of these - It was to be my third digital camera from Olympus . it seemed a perfect fit for me , since my last camera died from me getting it wet . To start with the positive : The form factor is great , and it really feels solid . But the negative list is a bit longer : The controls are VERY basic , with only some static modes - moreover it doesn't have a hardware switch for modes like the d-40 or 740uz . You have to use the LCD interface to do it . But the real problem with this camera was the indoor photo quality . I actually returned this camera , as I was VERY disappointed with the quality of the indoor pictures . Even self timer shots from a tripod were blurry ! I got the 740UZ instead . it is WAY bigger , but at least it takes decent pictures . If you are going to buy this camera , make sure you buy it from amazon or another place with a good returns policy !  
2	  Length : 0:22 MinsI love the iFlip but I do have one small complaint .  
1	  So far I have purchased 2 of these poor excuses for finished software . Neither ever installed properly on my PC running XP home edition . The error I kept receiving was " computer not modified " . On my first copy , despite entering the proper license ID and Password , it would always give me an error code that said that I had not entered the correct license ID . Save yourself the trouble and frustration . This company should send all of its customers who purchased the previous terrible versions either full rebates or the latest version , assuming that PoddMax 09 actually works which I doubt . I really wanted all the features to work but alas , none ever did on my desktop or laptop . Support for any of these problems was totally non existent . It is as close to a sham as I have ever seen . Amazon should be ashamed of itself for carrying this piece of trash . Podmaxx 09  
2	  when i found this i was amazed it was so cheap . when i got it ( two days later ) and confirmed this awesome find i ordered a couple more ..  
1	  They sounded great , but my head is large ( I think my hat size is 7 5/8 ) and they were absolutely crushing . I tried flexing the neckband so much to widen them , they snapped . I lost a lot on these .  
2	  Flawless picture and sound , no problems at all . If you need an HDMI cable go ahead and get this one , you wonr be disappointed .  
1	  Initally , I enjoyed using this player but after a month orso the player wouldn't work . I reloaded the firmware as directedby on-line support without success . The player turns itself off rather than playing the selected file . Now what ?  
2	  This is a quality made UV protection filter . Not only does it protect your camera from the sun but no photographer should be without a UV filter . They not only protect from UV but also prevent lens breakage . If your lens was accidently hit by an object the UV filter would likely prevent your expensive lens from being broken . It is much cheaper to break a UV filter than your camera lens .  
1	  Pros : These speakers look cool . The volume control unit is very convenient . Cons : You can only control the bass . On many songs you hear too much bass ( sounds like someone blowing in a jug at times ) OR the tweeters . Mid range is missing . If I had tried these in the store before buying I probably would have bought something else . Not a great sound at $ 50 . My Boston BA265 speakers , for example , had a much more even , rich sound at half the cost . I 'll probably sell mine and splurge on the Klipsch 2.1s . Maybe if your playing device has an equilizer you could smooth it out . Some people like this sound setting ; I just don't .  
2	  Although I had to return the first player because it appeared to have been a returned unit with a smudge near the speaker and an error message when powering-up , the replacement player is fantastic . I 'm glad I took a chance on ordering a replacement instead of just getting my money back because the one I now have has given me no problems and I really enjoy it . I take it everywhere and when I 'm listening to the music player , I don't have to worry about it skipping while walking or running , it plays just fine . Movies are very clear with no eye strain from watching a small screen . The built-in speaker is not good but with headphones , it 's just like the movies . I bought the add-on Opera browser , another $ 30 . Couldn't get wi-fi to work with 26 key ( I think ) high encryption but works fine now that I am using 16 key with linksys wi-fi router . I love being able to surf the net from any free wi-fi area . Help , I may be forming an addiction to this gadget ! Ruth  
2	  Too many splitters were degrading my cable signal . This booster installed without a hitch , and my television and digital phone clarity increased immediately . However , my cable modem was unable to start / maintain a live Internet connection , even when connected directly to the booster . To fix this , I connected the modem to yet another coax splitter to cut the boost back down . Now things are working great . * because it did the polar opposite of what it promised for my cable Internet signal .  
2	  Just purchased this product to send living room ( cable ) TV to my 23 " HDTV on my garage work bench , which is hooked up to an indoor antenna . Well , I 'm surprised how well it transmitted the HD video and audio through 2 walls about 40 feet away to my little garage TV , using its AV input . So , I still have over-the-air reception , and HD reception from my living room cable / DVR unit - completely flexible . I 'm very well pleased . ONE DRAWBACK : The HD video transmitted to my garage TV is only in 480p , resulting in a reduced size picture - does NOT transmit 1080i for some reason .. but the audio is awesome . This may be due to the cable box / DVR output ( video out ) setting but I 'm still investigating . Nonetheless , as long as you line up the units , point to point , video and sound are almost perfect , and no interference with my wireless 5.8 Gig phones or my home wireless ( G / N ) network .  
1	  From the first day that I brought this player home it has had problems . First of all , it is very slow for loading times and exchange times . Next , it jitters and jumps on DVDs , new ones and old ones . I just purchased The Rundown and right out of the case it has problems with this movie . The problem is difficult to describe . At first I thought that it was having difficulty transitioning to the second layer on dual layer discs , however after further testing it appears to have problems with any part of the second layer . As most people know , or will find out , movies that are purchased are created with dual layer technology and the latter portion of most movies are on the second layer . I also noticed this problem occuring in the beginning segments of my daughter 's Brother Bear movie . It plays CDs fine and plays MP3 cds fine as well . I wish that when it played CDs that it would provide a list of the tracks - not the titles , just at least the track numbers on the TV screen . When an MP3 disc is played it lists the file names on the TV , which is nice , however , if you have files that have cryptic filenames and you rely on the MP3 ID tag when you listen to them on your computer , it becomes difficult to decipher them on the television screen . I would recommend that the consumer keeps on shopping . I have gone through 2 Sonys before I purchased this DVD player and a JVC prior to those Sonys . The Sonys do not last very long , lasers burn out easily , but are great for features and speed . I am looking for a Pioneer to match my receiver or possibly invest in a higher end player to replace this disappointing JVC.I purchased mine for $ 179.99 as Ultimate Electronics in February 2004 .  
1	  My 2 stars are for the aesthetics and versatility of this product , respectively . They definitiely appeal to a broad range of people , and its a great idea to include three different sizes for all ear canals . BUT .. These are badly designed . Any earbud with such a narrow speaker is an open invitation for permanent hearing loss . I tried the small and medium sizes first and while the medium fit very snuggly , it felt WAY too deep . With the large , i couldn't get a good seal and subsequently wound up with poor bass quality . We were told for years to take caution when cleaning our ears with q-tips - all of a sudden , we throw that advise out the window in the name of convenience . Over the head or around the neck headphones are certainly cumbersome , but at least you know what you 're getting . Too many earbuds are manufactured without accounting for people 's poor judgement . Push em too far in to get a better seal and you wind up listening to dead silence for the next 50 years . These are also supposed to provide great bass and I was not impressed . When it comes to headphones , solid bass comes from a solid seal . Earmuff headphones are the best in the biz there . Any earbud trying to accomplish the same type of bass is going to warrant shoving them as far as possible into your ear . FYI , Sony offers more affordable earbuds with better audio quality and a safer design . Sony MDR-E828LP Fontopia Earbuds with Winding CaseI 've had em for a year and they 've never failed .  
1	  Hooked it up and the picture is there but it 's full of artifacts . By artifacts I mean it looks like its snowing different color snowflakes lol . Don't buy this if it 's for serious use . I don't know anyone who would use it .  
1	  I ordered this television from Amazon on January 15 , 2007 . The shipping estimate in the confirmation e-mail was 16 January , with a delivery estimate between 19 and 23 January . The item shipped on January 16th , with an estimated arrival date of 25 January . At first , I couldn't locate a website for " Eagle . " The actual company name is " Eagle Global Logistics , " and Googling that will yield their website . Their tracking information is pretty poor , as the updates didn't seem to make any sense . It would report my shipment arriving in Columbus on one day , and the next day it would update with that day 's date , again reporting it had " arrived . " This went on for a few days . On January 23rd , the item arrived at Jacksonville Airport , and I received a phone call from " EGL " to set a delivery appointment . I was told the earliest date they could deliver was on January 26th . I asked for an earlier date , but was told the only date I could have was the 26th , and that the best they could offer for an appointment was a four-hour window . " Free shipping , " does not include the four hours of vacation time one has to take to sit around waiting for the delivery truck . I arrived home at 12:00pm today , and as these things go , the truck arrived at 4:00pm . I buzzed them through the gate , then waited several minutes until EGL called and asked me where my unit was located . I gave them directions and met the truck at the curb . When they opened the truck , the TV was lying part-way on its side , as though it had fallen over . They insisted that they had done that , to " lay it down " as they didn't have cargo straps to carry it upright as the box clearly states . Based on the experiences of others here at Amazon , I expected them to take the TV upstairs , unbox it and set it up so that I could be confident it was delivered in working order . They had no such understanding , they were adamant they were only to take it into my unit and that was the extent of their service . The didn't unbox the unit . I signed for it noting that the condition was unknown , and no set-up service was offered . I believe my order qualified for " White Glove " service , though I have no idea what that really entails . I rather doubt that this was it . After they left , I immediately opened the box , and was disappointed to discover a large crack in the glass of the display . Basically , about one quarter of the panel would separate from the remainder of the panel if it weren't held together in the frame . I called EGL and they told me to take it up with Amazon . I called Amazon 's 1-800 number , which has always been a very satisfactory service in the past . Unfortunately , they seem to have made some changes . No combination of menu choices I tried could seem to connect me to a human being . Instead , I received repeated messages directing me to go to the web site to process my return . So , disappointed and believing I will not get the kind of timely response I expect from a web form , I went ahead and tried to process my return on the web page , only to receive an unspecified error message . So I 'm writing this review , doing my best to remain composed and as unemotional as possible . The service provided by EGL was unsatisfactory . I believe the TV was damaged in shipment , though of course I have no way of knowing if EGL received it that way or not . In any event , EGL 's customer service was surly , lethargic and unsatisfactory . Amazon 's customer service , at the time of this post , is non-existent ! I have no way to initiate any effort to have this item returned . I am in no way interested in waiting another 10 days for a replacement to be delivered . I am in no way interested in spending another four hours of vacation waiting for a delivery company to come and collect this enormous , inert box occupying my living room , . I have been a very satisfied Amazon customer for many years now , and ordinarily I would be inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt . But this new 1-800 number policy , and malfunctioning web services are unsatisfactory . At this point , the savings offered by no sales tax and a low price have been wiped out by the time , aggravation and inconvenience of this experience . I have no idea how I will be able to speak to someone in customer service in order to arrange for an exchange under terms that would be acceptable to me . I 'm inclined to think it would simply be better to request a refund , toss the box down the stairs and let it sit outside until someone comes along to collect it , and go buy the unit at Best Buy . I 'm having a party here next weekend , and the TV was to be a big part of that . I really have no idea how I 'm going to get to be able to speak , e-mail or smoke-signal someone at Amazon . So , this is just one data point . Others have clearly had much better experiences . But if something goes wrong , expect it to go wrong badly . It won't be a simple matter to clear it up . I 'm very disappointed and dissatisfied with Amazon in this transaction .  
2	  I have tested a lot of computer speakers on my computer and ALWAYS the sound was distorted when I turned up the volume to the maximum ! My computer had originally Windows 98 and JBL speakers and everything worked great until I updated to Windows ME , then to Windows 2000 and after that to XP . XP works great with everything but one thing ! The original sound drivers didn't work for my sound card in XP and they were replaced by generic ones . My JBL speakers got damaged thanks to the SRS WOW Effects on Windows Media Player and the Equalizer . Even when the JBL speakers weren't damaged the bass would sound distorted and the volume at the maximum was very very bad . After that I bought these Cyber Acoustics Speakers with a 15 watt powered subwoofer and 4 speakers and the Bass was still distorted ! I got tired and bought these Klipsch EXPENSIVE speakers ( 5.1 , 5 speakers and Subwoofer ) and I could still hear some kind of distortion . I returned those Klipsch and lived a bad sound life ( in my computer ) for a while . The BOSE store just opened in the best mall in Puerto Rico like 3 months ago and I played with all their home theater systems and speakers ! I loved ( and still love ) those Computer Speakers and I decided that after Christmas when I had more money I would get them ! ( I am only 15 years old and I dont work and don't need to ) . Well I bought these speakers 3 days ago and it is just incredible the difference in sound ! The music gets around me and it feels like if I was on a concert ! It has deep bass that isn't distorted at all ! I just turn the volume up at 1/4 of the maximum and it is loud enough for me and the best is that you can connect it to your TV , a CD Player and anything with sound output ! I even connected it to my Xbox and it sounds louder and even better than my SONY 650 watt 5.1 speaker system ! ( The bass isn't as loud as the subwoofer , but it sounds great ! ) Connect it to your DVD Player too ! It is incredible ! And I never turned the volume up to the maximum ! These are the speakers you have always wanted and dreamt of for your computer ! My room is filled with sound when I use them ! BOSE .. Better sound through research ! Go to a BOSE Store and test them . You will love BOSE forever ;) . Something else ! They are GREAT for gaming ! Try to play Unreal Tournament 2003 and you will love the bass !  
1	  I don't even use it anymore , didn't think it was that great . I got a gel rest from fellows , a lot better ..  
1	  I 've been using my 16GB Verbatim for about 6 months . I used it as little as possible as it often corrupts the directory structure . The system always fixes it , but one day , it will just die .  
1	  The Monster screen cleaner works great on my PC monitors but on my new Samsung LED LCD it leaves horrible streaks . It must be because of the gloss finish to the screen but after spraying it down and wiping the screen I 've noticed rainbow colored streaks all over . It easily take 4x the amount of wiping down to get rid of the streaks compared to quick wipe-down of my PC monitors .  
1	  My expectation for batteries is pretty low since my last one refused to hold a charge AT ALL and I had to always keep the laptop plugged in . This one came quickly , was marked " Sony " on the back ( not sure if they all are ) and it has worked like a charm . Update as of Nov 30 , 2009 : The battery now won't hold a charge past 3 % , so it 's operating via the power plug only . Bummer ! Contacted customer service but never got a response .  
1	  DONT BUY MAGELLAN ! Totally unreliable , died when I needed it during a trip in Florida . The Call support center has been outsourced to the Phillipines ! I had to send the dead unit to Texas . They have had it for almost one month , cannot fix it and do not have a replacement to ship to me . So I continue to wait in limbo . Will never buy a Magellan again or recommend it to anyone .  
2	  After purchasing this camera a year ago I donated my SLR camera to my high school alma matter . The Sony Cybershot is a easy to use camera that allows you to take any kind of picture you want . Even though I rate the camera itself 5 stars , I wish Sony would create lens and other camera accessories for this professional style camera .  
2	  Product arrived on time and functions as described . I would recommend this product for anyone wanting to store a large number of DVD 's or CD 's . The only slight issue is that it 's slightly difficult to zip it shut once a lot of DVD 's are in it . Not a real problem and it gets a little easier once you get used to it . I actually just put it back on the shelf unzipped most of the time as it doesn't really need to be zipped shut to sit on the shelf .  
2	  Lost my wife 's lens cover . Thank goodness I found this one . Not expensive at all . I 'd rather pay to replace the lens cap than a scratched lens .  
1	  I have used many brands of DVD + R / DVD-R . Memorex seems to have a high rate of unsuccessful burns . I would recommend another brand . TDK seems to be my favorite . Never any problems and more affordable .  
2	  The only reason i give this a 4 instead of a 5 star is that it could use some updates . ie . metal foot , weather sealing , to bring it up to current standards . This transmitter works great and does all that Canon says it will .  
2	  I bought this flash card to use in my Sony DSC-HX5V camera . I took over 1,100 photos and 50 HD videos on a recent 6 day trip . I only used about 40 % of this cards capacity . It was way overkill for what I needed , but for the price , who cares ! Transfers are extremely fast onto our computer or PS3 with the Class 6 speed .  
1	  It did not work at all . this is worse purchase I have eversi & oacute ; n done . WhenIt arrive the box was not even damage . Then I conected to the usb and nothing happened , not one letter work  
2	  My ipod video 30gb was skipping on some video podcasts and a thorough disk checking showed some problems with the drive , so I replaced it with an 80 GB Toshiba MK8025GAL and replaced the battery with this while I was at it ( and to get the tools ) . Opening the case was easy , just watch the video and follow the instructions . Caveat : the cables and connectors are * tiny * . I 'm very comfortable opening up computers and playing with components . Make sure you are also , and that you have a well lit place to work on your ipod . If you 're not , I 'd recommend trying any of the many places that will do this for you for relatively cheaply . The hardest part about replacing the battery was prying the old battery off the case . Once I got that out of the way , it took a few tries to get the battery cable back in the connector solidly , but no major issues . On the hard drive , the only hard part was with the cables . Getting it off the old drive , onto the new drive , and then reconnected to the main board took some finagling . But once it was done , put it all back together , plugged it in , and did a restore of my ipod software and everything 's going great . I now have an 80GB video ipod in the slimmer 30GB case , with an even longer life battery ( not to mention the new drive has the same performance with lower power consumption0 . The key when buying a replacement hard drive for this is making sure you get a 1.8 " 5mm high drive - an 8mm high drive won't fit . Giving 4 stars since I want to wait a few months and see how the battery holds up .  
1	  Well made but poorly desingned . There is no anti slip so the strap keeps sliding off your shoulder . Don't buy it !  
1	  Well made but poorly desingned . There is no anti slip so the strap keeps sliding off your shoulder . Don't buy it !  
1	  This camera is a piece of junk . I have upgraded to the latest firmware ( 1.07 ) and still can't get the audio to work . You 'll be better off buying a trendnet or panasonic IP camera .  
2	  The Sigma 70mm 2.8 lens gets an excellent review at [ .. ] for its optics and image quality , and I think the 70mm focal length works well for close-up flower photos . I returned this lens only because I found it too long and heavy to keep steady while used with my monopod for garden and wildflower shots ( it weighs 1.2 pounds ) . I just don't find it practical to use a tripod on hikes in the hills . If I buy another marco lens I 'll probably go with the Canon EF-S 60mm f / 2.8 USM for my Canon EOS Rebel XSi , which is significantly lighter and shorter .  
2	  This camera may not be as tiny as some ultra-slim cameras , but it is , by no means , a large camera . It can be easily held and operated by one hand . The camera is perfect for someone that doesn't want to worry about any complicated procedures . It 's about as easy as can be to just pop in the batteries , a memory card , and get started shooting pictures . We upgraded from a 3MP camera , and everything about this camera is so much better . Some of the reasons we chose this camera are : - Optical viewfinder ( very hard to find these days on small cameras ) - 4x Optical zoom . Most compact cameras max out at 3x . - Image Stabilization for little or no blur in shots - Digic II chip with face detection . There 's really nothing I can think of we don't like about this camera . The price was nice and affordable . It 's compact and easy to carry . It only requires 2 AA batteries . Nice screen on the back to preview pics , etc , etc . And best of all , my wife absolutely loves using this camera . I am no longer the ' designated photographer ' .  
1	  So my TV makes this popping noise with the sound and is especially aparent when the tv is in the srs surround sound mode . I was so amped for this tv but so far its been a huge bust . Maybe I one of the few , but so far samsung has had very mediocore service , from customer service to the repair technician . They arent going to let me send it back until the repair guy trys 3 times to fix it . It already needs a new mother board . I didnt even know tvs have monther boards . Also the S-video cable was very hard to install the prongs for my dvd player . Also for people that have the tv now . Do not use " Dynamic Mode " it comes this way and the picture looks great . But your contrast is set at 100 and will burn out your bulb real quick FYI . Move to around 85 to save the life of your bulb . So far some HD channels look great some mediocore . It might be my cable box . I dont know the espn baseball games look good and the FOX games look like garbage . As for videogames it works great on my 360 and there really is no lag problems . I have to miss time from work now and now I regret not buying a flat pannel . Update : Its been almost 18 days now since I called Samsung and their technician keeps reschdueling with me . This has been a horrible experience . I also notice alot of motion blurr on hdtv channels when the camera moves really fast , like tracking a homerun leave the park . So mad I bought this thing . Update . August 08 I need another motherboard . Samsung is hastling over whether or not they will replace my tv . My audio out does not work now . Way to go samsung . The part is on back order . So I take it this happens all the time . Terrible , terrible purchase . Do you know how much of a pain this is to take time off of work to meet a repair guy 3 times in a month ? Samsung I need a new tv . NOWUpdate : August 14th Samsung has been a nightmare to deal with . After calling on hours on end once a day for the past month they finally are replacing my tv . Good luck if anything ever goes wrong with your tv . This has been THE worst experience as far as purchasing a big ticket item . An Insider Tip if you have to deal with their customer service dept . Immediately Ask for an ERC , they over see the customer service reps and have authority to solve your issues . If I could give this tv 1 star I would . For some reason I cant change it . Anyways . I honestly think Samsung has posted the majority of these reviews so be careful .  
2	  So this item is an adapter , not a voltage converter . Make sure your device supports 220v before using it in Europe . All devices are required to have that label on them somewhere . It will say something like 110v ~ 220v or similar if both voltages are supported . Most battery chargers and that kind of thing will work for both , so all you need is this adapter . This adapter worked great . It 's compact and very functional . I used it so I could charge my camera batteries while I was in Italy . I had no problems . I even lent it to my friend whose adapter was not working .  
2	  Works great ! The best headphones I 've owned yet ! Got great reviews so I went for it . A spectacular deal . Purchased it without the original package but everything works perfectly so far .  
2	  I 've tried several from Apple to Sony . These work wonderfully and sound great . They stay in place , so once positioned you don't have to mess with them again . Great for the longer runs / workouts . Very comfortable , you forget you are wearing them . Definite must . $ 39 - $ 49 .  
2	  The digital camera worked very well . The price was right and the packaging and delivery time were excellent . Thank you .  
2	  I started out with Sony walkman ( Cassette Player ) , then went to the CD player . Both were noticable ( heavy ) when I was running . ( Radio reception was terrible ) . I graduated to the MP-3 player , psyc . Small and light , but needed to change the batteries . Then I went to the Jelly bean style . Very Happy with this , but needed more room ( 1gb ) . So now I have Sony NW-205F with 2 gb . It gives you playlists or artists albums . It doesn't have the entire list shuffle , which the jelly bean does . The sounds are fantastic . However I am still experimenting with the headphones . The ear buds , pop out every once in a while . The behind the ear hoop , keeps them in place . But the cable gets pulled from the armband to the noggin ' . I just ordered the clip on style . So the jury hasn't seen the evidence on this yet . But all the mp-3s are easy to download . Easy to remove songs etc .. I haven't had a run where the batts have died , but if with age the batt can't hold a charge for a long period time , then time will tell .  
2	  I ordered this ( relatively ) small microSD card for my burn phone to store the files I need for work . It 's been a dream . Snapped it into place and it showed up immediately on the phone as well as when I plug the phone into any system .  
1	  We bought this plasma TV back in November 2007 through Amazon . Delivery was as advertized , Amazon kept us updated , the plasma TV was delivered on time . The TV is great , very crisp image , good colors , but I would not buy it again . It broke after only 8 months ( July 2008 ) . To add to this desapointment , I found Panasonic warranty service very poor . It took them 11 days from the original call just to make a decision on the repair and ship the part to the service company . And this is with us pushing . When I asked the customer service department how much longer it would take to get it back , I was told " the time for the service company to do the repair " . Thanks ! Certainly no over-promessing here . After I explained this was not a satisfactory answer , I was told 1 days for delivery and typically another 3 days for the repair .. so best case , considering they do not count weekends , this will mean 17 days from the original call , and , again , this is with us pushing . Now granted this is just a TV , it is not as if we cannot live without it , but frankly , who needs the aggravation ?  
1	  System developed a " popping " & " crackling " sound and would shut itself down . Tried changing cables , cleaning inside reciever , this did not help . Would work for maybe 10 mins and POP & Crack and shut itself down . Paid almost $ 1000.00 for something I can not use . Onkyo will not return emails . Extremely bad Customer Service !  
1	  It comes down to getting what you pay for and it turns out a cheap amp is a piece of junk . I was a bit leary that there were no up close pictures of the connections and not a complete set of specs for this amp . My first problem is that there are no connectors for power and ground . The power , ground , and remote wires are about 14 gage wire ( not 4 , not 8 like they should be ) and are soldered to the internals . Secondly I find it hard to believe this is making 300 watts since it has only a 10 amp fuse , my math may be wrong but I think if it put out around 120 it would pop the fuse ( 12 volts X 10 amps ) Thirdly when I connected this amp the electrical noise it was sending was pretty bad , not just a humming sound but a crazy annoying sound that goes in and out . I guess buy this amp if you don't mind lack of power , and bad sound quality . As for me I switched my 6X9 's back to my deck which sounded way better than through this amp . I hope you will not cheap out like me and get a quality product  
1	  I faithfully used my prior Logitech Harmony 880 , and when it finally broke , I decided to upgrade to Logitechs 's flagship 1000 model ( which I have been using for several months ) . However , the new Harmony 1000 is so painful to use that I am seriously considering swallowing the $ 500 and buying another 880 ! I have had to dig out my original device remote controls , and once again have 3 different remotes littering the coffee table . My wife has given up , and completely refuse to use this thing anymore . Problems specific to the 1000 model : 1 . It uses ' beta ' software and crashes regularly . Adding salt to the wound , there is no reset switch , and you have to pry open a stubborn battery latch , remove and replace the battery , and then wait several minutes to reboot . 2 . The touch screen is cumbersome , it is not very customizable , and it is poorly laid out . The unintended result of streamlining this remote and removing the hard buttons is that it forces the user to navigate multiple menus just to get to the desired buttons . However , you cannot rearrange the screen to simply include you most frequently used commands , nor can you choose which set of buttons first pops up when you choose an activity . 3 . The touch screen forces you to actually look at the remote to find the buttons you want , like the guide or menu button . Also , the screen saver kicks in after a few minutes , and then forces you to first joggle the device to ' wake up ' so you can see the screen . 4 . The shape makes it very difficult to use with one hand ( and I have large but agile monkey hands ) . Those are my top complaints for the Harmony 1000 . I do still enjoy a good universal remote , but this is not the model to buy . Please note that it you happen do get a Logitech universal remote ( the 880 was fine ) , be prepared for a Lengthy set up process to get it correctly tweaked . It takes a long time for Logitech 's remotes to change settings , and tweaking your first remote for optimal efficiency can take an hour + .  
1	  We had our TV three months before it broke - it started turning on and off on its own until it just wouldn't turn on again . We gave the TV to the service center ( authorized by Toshiba ) who told us the part they needed was back-ordered at Toshiba . Over two weeks later , we 're still in the queue to have Toshiba simply look for the part , with no guarantees as to if or when they 'll find it . We 've had to make multiple phone calls just to get Toshiba to do anything at all - and we 've had to act as the middle man between the authorized service center and Toshiba . I definitely won't be buying another Toshiba TV after this experience !  
1	  I have purchased many ink refills and this one turned out to be very disappointing . The ink dries up from the cartridge very quickly and it doesn't print full letters . It was a total waste of my money .  
2	  I cannot speak highly enough about both the item , Canon DCK-E1 Kit , that I ordered , and the seller . The kit is exactly as described by the seller . As described , the item was new , in fact , it was still hermetically sealed in it 's original plastic-wrap inside it 's box , and the price was more than fair . The price was less than half of Canon 's listed price . The seller was helpful , beyond the call , when the delivery of my item became a problem . He remained in touch with me , offering tracking number info , dates , etc . until the item was delivered into my hands . I could not have hoped for a better FIRST-TIME EXPERIENCE on Amazon .  
1	  The Harmony 550 is an " all right " but not a great universal remote . For the price tag it demands , there are better options . Shortcomings :( 1 ) Ergonomics - the buttons are just plain too small . And if the size of the buttons isn't trouble enough , the non-spatial row of buttons design is a second cause for annoyance . In other words , you never get an intuitive feel for the button layout , and it results in daily occurence of user error .. even after 8 months of ownership . And it 's nearly impossible to navigate with the lights in the room dimmed . ( 2 ) Ease of configuration - you can get up and running in crude fashion in 15 minutes . Getting the remote to really work like the one that came with your TV / DVD player / Receiver takes about 2.5 hours of trial-and-error optimization . It turns the volume up & down in much larger quantums than the OEM remote , and will often change one too many channels when channel surfing . Through loading and reloading and resting the remote , these types of kinks can be reduced after a 1-2 hours of debug . But they can't be eliminated altogether . Logitech took on a big challenge in making the king of universal remotes . This one has software optimization and ergonomic problems that other Logitech remotes don't have .  
2	  Revieved this cord 2 days after ordering for my ps3 . Exactly as described . Its a 120v 7a cord . Runs my ps3 perfectly fine and is snug in the outlet receptacle ! I did have to shave a little off to fit in the ps3 as I 'm sure this cord wasn't designed exaclty for it but its the same specifications as the ps3 cord !  
1	  This multi hub port works on my mainframe but not on my laptop . Poor design  
2	  I received this product in a timely fashion and it was extremely easy to install . I have had no problems with it , and it is not noisy as others have complained it is . It is actually very quiet , except for a tiny faint motor sound for a few seconds when you access files from it . I am only using it for simple storage of files , nothing fancy .  
1	  I bought this product and it never worked . There is also no customer service for this company .. forget about getting someone on the phone !  
2	  overall I like the phone . it does take a little getting used to since it 's so small . If your eyesight isn't the best make sure your glasses are always on hand for this one . I dont like that you really can't clip it on with much confidence . It will slip off easily . Also the fact that you have to keep it on the base in order to insure it 's charged up means you can't just clip it on and go about your business .  
1	  These headphones have a rather strange fit . The cans are HUGE , and I just couldn't get them to fit nicely over the ear . They left a gap at the bottom of the ear , along the jawline . If I pushed them up ( so that the bottom of my ear was touching the bottom of the can ) , then they didn't fit well at the top . I ended up returning them , and buying Bose QC15s , which fit my head perfectly . Maybe I have a small head , but I would recommend trying a pair for fit before buying .  
1	  My usb port was about 1.5 feet from the mouse and the mouse still did not pick up the signal . Tried it out with 2 sets of mice and the same results . Went back to Best Buy and got a logitech ( V200 ) that worked right out of the box  
2	  This is my first tiffen filter and I am planning to keep buying from this manufacturer . Affordable price and delivers quality colors .  
1	  I am actually glad I didn't recieve the item I ordered , because I ended up buying one that is much nicer and has much better sound quality . I was very angry when I recieved an email from the seller saying the product had been damaged in shipping and they didn't have any more to send and that was it . No other suggestions , nothing . This item was for a specific event and I had to wait two more weeks until I was able to purchase another product and get it to my husband .  
1	  This camera is not durable for use . We took our ' new ' canon A70 on vacation and just a slight splash of water took the $ 300 camera to a piece of trash . I have owned many digital cameras and never have I owned or heard of a camera that was any where near the sensitivity of this one to exposure to moisture . I was able to exchange this camera for a new camera the same model . This time I purchased the water proof case . I later discovered that the canon water proof case is not waterproof as canon claims it is . Furthermore , the delay from the time you push the button to the time the picture actually takes is way too long , making it near impossible to get the shot you want . I give the Canon A70 a big thumbs down . Go back to the drawing board Canon . And don't do your customers the injustice of claiming a product is water proof when it is not . You are deceiving what should be your most valuable asset - your customers .  
1	  I purchased this wireless mouse because it was less expensive than the mouse I really wanted ( the Microsoft mouse that works on glass ) . The mouse requires battery replacement all the time . I go through AA batteries at least once a month . This is excessive , compared to other wireless mouse products . Scroll will hesitate , and then while you are scrolling up a page , for no reason , it scrolls a little bit backwards and moves you back down the page . Then you have to scroll back up . It will do this for about the length of 4 or 5 sentences , so almost like a hesitation . It is annoying . I am a professional writer and can not stop during a critical project to address these concerns all the time . I 'm out the door today and going to buy a new mouse . I really do not like posting negative reviews , but under the circumstances you need to know . There is nothing more frustrating than working on a critical project late at night and then all of a sudden the mouse stops working due to the battery issue . The first time it happens you won't know to have batteries " on hand " and it will be a big disappointment . I hope if you do buy this product , that you go ahead and purchase a large pack of spare batteries . I would also like to mention that I have used all types of batteries . Expensive ones , cheap ones , etc . They make no difference , this mouse leaves you high and dry all the time , and always at the most inconvenient times . I can't understand why they pull so much juice from a battery . Kind of makes you wonder if this is made within electronic federal standards and if it is dangerous to be around the mouse for a long period of time .. This is an update .. 6 hours later .. I have purchased my new mouse . It is a Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000 White . Amazing .. the scroll feature is so smooth . Works like a charm , and on the packaging it says the battery will last approximately 10 months . Finally .. !  
2	  The Sony ICF-S79V Weather Band Shower Radio is everything its advertised to be and more . Worked perfectly after batteries installed , was / is easy to preprogram stations - even an AARP senior can do it , the sound is great with plenty of volume range . Portable so use it in main bath , the shower , and outside . Wonderful reception capability . Highly recommend it !  
1	  This was my first Digital camera . I must say its small and easy to carry around . But it delivered poor quality prints in the mail . Not very good resolution . I also did not like the set up of the zoom buttons and on and off . Also having to miss a shot to get to the shot setup first . Cant go fast from portrait to landscape . I brought mine back to store and now I am using another type . Will let you know on that one .  
2	  When I bought this camera , was a little skeptical about Kodak but to my surprise the camera has performed above expectations . The easyshare software is pretty helpful too . I also have a compact Canon SD 1100IS but got to say I find Kodak 712 results far better . The results in low light were a little .. " low " but using this camera with a tripod during night gave better performance .  
1	  I don't know if it 's any good or not . I only bought it to use with the WII HDMI Converter I bought at the same time - which is a piece of junk . I am tired of buying crap that was made in Communist Red China .  
2	  I purchased this system as a surround sound package for streaming netflix and video from our computer to HDTV . I think a full stereo system and separate speaker package .. would be a better overall system but the cost prevented me from going that route . This is cheap enough so that if I ever decide to have a full stereo system I 'll use this as a killer surround sound system for a stand alone computer somewhere in my house and I don't have to worry about an expensive stereo system becoming out-dated . I would not have settled for bottom rung components so consequently , a full stereo system and components would have cost many times more than the Z-5500 package . The Logitech system allows for optical input , so I 've got a cable from my HDTV direct to the Z-5500 and that works great to play movies through my DVD player . This system sounds better than any sub-$500.00 surround system I 've heard . For the money , it is a great system and overall construction is very good . I do have a catching spot on my volume dial and so it doesn't rotate freely all the way around . It 's not a big deal though . It looks like a very quality item and the volume control unit is very nicely built and looks great . Inputs allow for a small desktop stereo to plug into it and I listen to my Ipod through it often as well . The options , cost , and quality , make this speaker system very hard to beat . I " ve had this system for more than two years now and it still performs flawlessly .  
1	  I had one before and had no problems so I upgraded to a 2GB . Radio freezes and no sound will come out . Power on can freeze and you have no way of turning device on and have to wait util it decided it is the right time . Item freezes up too much and then not only does Amazon and the Factory Depot give you the run around for a refund but they want you to get confirmation form sansdisk something is wrong with the item . So a refund isnext to impossible . Most of the items going out now form Sans for the Express are refurbished items ! Buy your electronics at a store !  
1	  This product , being wireless , is subject to interference . I thought that it would be incidental and avoidable , given that there are 3 different channels available to switch to on the unit . Unfortunately , all three channels had static in my house . It might be due to the fact that the base unit is next to other electronics , but honestly , use adjacent to a DVD player , cable box , and gaming console should not be unexpected . Either the product is very poor or the user is an idiot . I 'm not that stupid and couldn't locate anything in the instructions shipped with the product to help solve this problem . I recommend a different wireless headphone product or , more my more simple 2nd attempt , normal headphones and a cord extension .  
2	  This scanner is very definitely a five star item . We tried out many scanners . Some came with software that was difficult , or confusing in instructing the operator to use . If time is any consideration some seemed to poke along . Some were quick but the images produced were not always clear . Some scanners were noisy . Some bulky . This little baby is thin , sleek , easily portable , quick , and the 42 bit gives one excellent reproduction . If one has a digital camera , I think that is an especially important consideration .  
2	  The first thing I noticed was how natural the dialogue and voices sounded . It was truly centered when it needed to be and when it required a fron-to-back pan , everything was entirely smooth . I personally have mediocre speakers all around but wanted to spend a bit more on the center channel speaker as the focal point of upgrading my system and I couldn't resist this one when I tested it at my local store . I am a big fan of JBL products and this one definitely continues their line of excellent products . Strengths : 3/4 " Titanium laminate tweeters ( with NSP1 package all 5 speakers ) , coupled with JBL 's latest technology , the Elliptical Oblate Spheroid ( EOS ) waveguide ; seamless soundstage and wide dispersion @ REF Level ; Timbre ( voice ) Matched w / JBL N24s and other N seriesWeaknesses : None that I 've noticed at this price .  
2	  Just what I expected , the cord is stuff in it 's rolled up shape to a degree once you remove it from the pack . I suggest rolling it back up the opposite way and putting back in the box for a day or two to take care of that .  
2	  I absolutely love this card ! Its price can't be beat and it provides a reliable Internet connection . It works flawlessly ( and on the first connection attempt to ! ) with WPA . It gets lightning fast signal from my router that is on the other side of my house . I couldn't ask for more in terms of performance and value . BTW , the drivers included on the CD will get the card up and running .. but download the newest drivers from the manufacturer 's website . Those new drivers make all the difference : It greatly increases the signal strength and connection speed . In addition , the physical PCI card is very low profile . It sits right next to my video card on my motherboard and doesn't affect airflow from the GPU cooling fan . If you 're looking for a reliable wireless card , look no further !  
1	  This was for a person to replace something they lost that didn't belong to them . Item came on time . It took longer than expected considering how close it was but still on time . Didn't notice any issues when first opened packaging & turned it on . After I handed device over I got nothing but complaints about it . Item advertised as excellent condition considering it was used . However , I was told after a short while of use it wouldn't stay on for more than 1/2 an hour or so & there were a few more scratches than expected . Don't know if it 's the user or sellers fault but no one asked about returning it . So I can't be sure about it being false advertisement or user error . Have not used device myself this is second hand only .  
1	  I can confirm Mr Zinser 's review . I have a Dell 23 " LCD TV that weighs 23 pounds . The Omnimount documentation specifies that the mount works for this TV . But the TV immediately tilts all the way down . Omnimount had me tighten a few screws , which you could feel tighten the mechanism but not enough to support the TV . I would guess that Omnimount does not test all of the TVs that they claim work , but rather do it based on weight . It 's probably the distribution of weight that causes the problem rather than the gross weight . I would recommend looking at other suppliers , or at least make sure that you can return the product .  
1	  If you ever plan or intend to play older games DO NOT EVER buy this monitor .. The company doesn't support low resolution modes such as 320x200 which are pretty common even today . Basically the monitor stretches the image too much vertically when using 320x200 and 640x400 . Otherwise this monitor is nice but don't expect any sympathy from their support staff when you go boo-hoo . In fact , don't ever contact their support staff . Anyone who uses all caps in their emails anywhere makes me wonder how they will sound over the phone .  
2	  Cool retro design . The case does secure the entire camera , but tough to handle if you don't have it on your belt .  
2	  This thing is an awesome idea . Install the software . Plug it into your computer . Enter the products codes of your amplifier , TV , Bluray ( which is under DVD for some reason ) and DVR and your are done ! I got rid of 5 remotes and all the clutter that goes along with it AND it works perfectly with the XBOX 360 . My only complaints are : 1 ) The volume control comes in spurts ( hold button and then it seems to accelerate in volume rather than instantly climb - might be my amp ) 2 ) The button clicks take some getting used to . 3 ) 1 out of 5 times you have to hit " help " to retry one of the devices that failed to switch to the right channel or turn on ( again might not be the remote , but the device ) . 4 ) There is no Blu Ray setup settings . It is under the DVD section . However I give it a 5 because it is so easy to use and really well made .  
1	  Even lower priced Zeikos UV filters far outperform in clarity , sharpness and flare reduction . It took 3 Tiffen purchases for me to realize this .  
2	  Let me preface this review by stating a couple of things : 1 ) I really wanted the Bose QC2 's , but who wants to spend $ 300 on headphones ? 2 ) I have VERY small ear canals , so I didn't think these would work . 3 ) I like great sound but don't need perfection . So I purchased the Shure E2c 's and the Etymotic ER6 's at the same time and got the chance to test them head-to-head during a recent trip to Atlanta from San Jose , CA . A straight 4 hour flight with my iPod and two different sets of noise isolating ear phones - perfect opportunity to make a call . I 'll give you the bottom line first : I am buying the Bose QC2 's in a week or so . Neither of these ear phones fit me well enough to call them perfect , but that is the ONLY reason I 'm not keeping one of them . And if I had to choose one or the other , I 'd pick the Shure E2c 's - based strictly on ability to reproduce my music faithfully . The Etymotic phones actually sound great as well - in fact , there is no real difference in sound quality . Both sets offered clear , sharp sound . The Etymotics had better bass response , but only barely , and the Shures needed much less power to enjoy ( what I mean is that the Etymotics needed 3/4 volume to be as loud as the Shures at 1/2 volume setting ) . The noise isolation abilities seemed to lean towards the Shures as well , but that is probably more a factor of my ear canals than anything else . Suffice to say both worked well in reducing airplane noise to a tolerable level . Both phones fit okay with the smallest fittings , but neither was fabulous for me . The Shure wiring was really cool - I liked having the cables ( which are MUCH more sturdy than the Etymotic 's ) wrap back over the ears . But the Shures are much larger than the Etymotics and thus a bit more annoying to wear for long periods . For my money , as I said earlier , the Shure E2c 's are just a bit better than the Etymotic ER6 's , based solely on sound generation - they make more of it than the ER6 's . The ER6 is a bit better base solely on ease of use ( the Shures are a little harder to insert ) . It is a toss up on sound quality - you won't be dissapointed in either .  
1	  This product is complete junk and I will be returning this right away . The worst part is that it blew out my Yamaha A / V receiver and Monster Customer Service is a joke . They wanted me to send the product back to them so they could repair it and said there was no possible way it could have damaged my Yamaha . Now I have to have my Yamaha repaired at my expense . MONSTER HAS LOST MY BUSINESS FOREVER . STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF JUNK AND ALL MONSTER PRODUCTS .  
1	  Koss should change the name of this unit to the Clarity Eliminator . That is exactly what it does when you try to turn the volume down . All the clarity / treble disappears leaving a barely understandable muffled sound . I tried it with brand new Koss UR40 headphones plugged into the tape monitor jack on a TDK dual tape deck . By themselves , the headphones have only fair quality and are way too loud . Add the VC20 and the muffled sound makes the headphones with volume control TOTALLY USELESS . If you need a volume control for headphones DO NOT BUY THIS ONE . Either buy some other one or buy headphones with a volume control , such as the Koss UR29 .  
2	  Just went finished recording with a couple of discs and so far everything works great . These discs are able to store up to 6 hrs of material , so I 'll be able to do plenty of recording . Also , the 30 discs package I got at just under twenty bucks is a GREAT deal . If you need some DVD + RW 's , these are a great choice .  
2	  I got a set of these for a friend and had to get one for me .  
1	  This charger did not come with an American AC plug-in . It ruined my vacation . What is the point of having a Euro adapter with nothing to adapt . This company should check their stock more carefully .  
1	  I got this kit hoping that it would fit my 98 Honda Civic LX . I even spent the night before the install carefully twisting , soldering , and heat-shrinking the wires with to the after-market Sony stereo wire setup . Popped the old radio out and suprise , suprise - the plugs didn't match . This very well may work on other ' 98 Hondas , but if you 're expecting it to fit in your Civic LX - look somewhere else .  
1	  Be careful . I bought this battery without realizing it is NOT compatible with the Tablet . Then AntOnline wouldn't accept the return since I opened the package . The product probably works great , but I don't get a warm and fuzzy feeling from the AntOnline customer service .  
2	  Bought this guy the week it came out back in the late 90 's at guitar center , cost me $ 107 with tax ; California . It was also my first pup and went into a Samick strat replacing a bridge single coil . I had also received my Marshall valvestate combo 10 " at the same time , it was bliss . I use to play along with DioSabbath material in my youth and that combo sounded amazingly accurate , and I do mean accurate , It was entirely identical to the Mob Rules album . Everyone could hear the similarities , so it wasn't just in my head . It also rocked for Van Halen type harmonics and whatnot . I did not change the pots though , so at the time I was using 250k pots instead of a higher one , which is more common with humbuckers , so that helped define the sound more and made it more unique tonally . Back in the day , my sound was pretty sweet for what I wanted , just needed more reverb . Never ever heard , even up to this day , a pup that sounded quite like that . With a Marshall type amp / voice it was awesome . I later learned upon hanging with a more modernish metal crowd that the pup didn't sound so good with other amps . It sounded cool through Marshall and Laney , out of what I owned . Did not sound very good with Recto 's and RocPro 's and those " California " voiced amps , if you know what I mean . For those , I use Crunchlab 's and D-activators , those are better suited to define the crunch I want from those amps . But then those are like beefy steaks , the Iommi and a " British " voice amp are like awesome cole slaw .. or mashed taters and gravy if you so prefer . But they are so different , that I 'm sure they sound like bacon ( good thing ) when mixed together . I have yet to try this recording combo out , as my Iommi has vanished , stolen .. no doubt by those who would wish to wield Mjolnir , and I don't blame them . But touched , I was so much by the pup that my next ESP 6 stringer will have a pair , if not at least at the bridge with a 250k pot . But what does it sound like ? Heavy , heavy midrange , with a certain high frequency that perfectly compliments it . A razor blade comes to mind when hearing it . Like I said , it 's not modern at all . You want Dream Theater , later Metallica , Strapping Young Lad , this IS NOT IT . You want Sabbath , Halen , Zepplin , Maiden , this is more your cup of tea . It also does NOT , NOT , do Clean sounds . It adds dirt to anything , which brings me to the next point . This thing sounds great for gritty blues tones . If you are a blues player who wants to stand out just a smidgen , please try this guy out . Sounds great and different , you will be the alpha of the pack . Funny lil story , about a year and a half ago , Tony himself went to my work and ended up being my customer , I did not let on that I knew who he was , I wanted to see what he was like . One of the biggest sweethearts I ever met , at one point ended up telling him that I was a fan , embarrassed him , yada yada , got a picture with him too . I told him the story of this pickup and how he was in influence etc . He looked at both me and his buddy / manager .. he didn't know what I was talking about . LOL , it wound up being just one of those things he kinda put his name on and forgot about . But it was all cool , the pup sounds cool , and he was cool . D. . U. . N. . N. . done .  
2	  I 've used quite a few different brands of Ethernet cables , including making my own . Triplite 's are by far the best , both for quality , cost and the top of the cable is very well designed ( where a boot usually goes ) .  
2	  I just upgraded from my trusty 35mm to this digital camera . After researching for almost 2 weeks , I decided to buy this camera . It takes such sharp , crisp pics - even in low-light the pics have not been grainy . It 's easy to use - very user-friendly , especially for someone like me who has just bought their first digital camera . I am so glad this is the one I chose . The video is great and the sound is clear . I really like the fact that you can get rid of red-eyes on the LCD screen before you develop the pics .. there are so many great features - and for the price , you feel like you 've stolen the camera . :-) And Amazon delivered much earlier than the timeframe they gave me - 5 stars for them , too .  
1	  I know everyone thinks that this ipod is selling for a greatprice , which it is but that will come back to haunt you . Afteryour 1 year apple limited warrenty runs out you will not be ableto return this ipod to Amazon . It would be wise for you to buythis ipod at Best Buy and get the Performance Service plan for aextra $ 50 dollars . Do not be cheap and purchase this ipod onAmazon thinking you are getting a hot deal withthis dicounted price . You will be very sorry for your decisionwhen something goes wrong with this ipod after the warrenty runsout . Amazon wont do anything for you and then your stuck with a$254.87 piece of junk . Also do not purchase the Amazonservice plans . Both service plans are worthless , just check outthe reviews . The Apple service plan is $ 52 dollars and onlylasts for another year . Best Buy gives you a better bang foryour buck for service plans . Do not purchase an ipod from Amazonyou will be frustrated and sorry in the long run .  
2	  So previously to TiVo I would set a VCR to record my shows and many times I would miss a show due to the fact times change frequently for shows , sometimes they even add an extra minute or so a few weeks . After installing TiVo I had no problems with missing any of my shows again . I record on average about 10 + hrs of TV a week and now with TiVo I only watch about 8 because its so easy to skip the commercials and have control of what I am watching . I have this TiVo box working perfectly with my DirectTV box using the IR device . It is so easy to use that a child could pick up the remote and be working TiVo flawlessly in minutes . I would give TiVo 5 stars , but sometimes TiVo just seems a little slow for me . It has a 1-2 second pause when switching from Live mode to TiVo mode and I just wish it would go a little quicker . Nothing to cry home to mom about though .  
1	  The plastic that goes around your head broke after 3 months . The sound quality was fine . I would caution users to be very careful not to stretch the plastic much that goes over your head .  
1	  this camera worked fine for a while but then slide piece came off and the camera stopped working .. cost too much to fix .. don't buy .. too much for a throw away ..  
1	  This cartridge is supposed to be the same as LC51BK but it will not work in my Brother printer / fax . It does not recognize the cartridge . When I compare the " real " cartridge to this one I notice a difference : there is a little plastic pin that sticks out of the top of the " real " cartridge and is making contact with something inside the printer . The " comparable " cartridge looks exactly the same and fits in the slot perfectly , but does not have this little plastic piece so my printer is acting like the cartridge is not installed at all . BE CAREFUL and check your old cartridge before purchasing this one . It is a great deal but may not work for you !  
2	  The world has gone digital and yet Olympus produced one of the best 35mm cameras out there just as film cameras were becoming obsolete . It 's a shame because this camera kicks [ .. ] , because it 's simple to use , produces amazing shots and has a great zoom / lens , autofocus , battery life ( beats any digital camera ) and it feels great in my hand . I 've taken many shots with it , including B & W shots , which are even greater than color shots . I 've also taken tons of night shots , including auroras , which I never knew how to do before . This camera works especially well with Fuji film . I want to buy another one before they get rid of film cameras forever . Sad .  
2	  This recorder works great for the classroom . I have owned voice recorders before , but this one has many great features . First , all the buttons are easy to use & find - not as small as my previous recorder . I especially like the " pause " button , which is great when you want to stop recording ( it doesn't distract the speaker by making a loud noise , like you would if you hit the stop button ) , and is also useful when you are playing back the tape and want to take notes . The pause button is also located at a convient spot - no where near other buttons so you don't accidently hit " rewind " or the dreaded " PLAY " button in the middle of class ! I also picked this recorder because it has a counter on it to help me match my notes with the tape . I must point out that I was in the second row of my classroom , and the teacher spoke loudly . I had one professor who did not speak as loud , and I have trouble hearing * everything * he says on playback . However , I was impressed that the recorder itself was quiet , and cause minimal " noise " on the tape . I do plan to buy a microphone , however , so that the sound of the tape recorder will not effect the sound as much ( for the softer-speaking teacher ) . I would recommend this recorder and have no regrets in purchasing it . I think it is probably one of the best in it 's price range . It should be noted , however , that this recorder takes normal sized tapes , NOT mini-cassettes .  
2	  Great , fast interface with mac os ( intel ) however , the reported interface with windows xp is not so clean . otherwise , excellent product .  
2	  This bag is plenty big for me ; I have a D-200 with an 18-200 lens attached most of the time and it fits vertically into the bag just fine . There is also room for another couple of lenses , flash , batteries and other accessories . I wouldn't want to carry around any more . The only problem I have with this bag is the shoulder strap that I wish was wider , or had a padded piece over the shoulder . If you fill this bag , it can get to be a pretty heavy load . All in all though , it 's a well-constructed , functional bag at a reasonable price .  
2	  Now by the title saying you cant go wrong I mean that in the sence of having a fairly small sterio subwoofer set up , the wire is def appx : 12 guage , it looks the part of ah 8 gauge wire but under all the coating its about 12 , all the wires seem to be fine i mean for the price you really cant beat it , the fuse holder for the power wire is really nice and the rca 's seem to be nice also the only kinda crappy wire is the speaker wire but you can get better stuff any where not a biggie , I bought a 95 civic coupe for my girlfriend and put one twelve inch sub in the trunk and I heard no electronic noise , hissing or whining , the kit does the job , I wouldnt power a big system with it but for small first timers it would be good .  
2	  This was the cheapest scanner with the specs I was looking for in an at home scanner . I use it probably every other day , mostly to at home deposits . I 've only used it a couple of times for pictures ( some old 1940s pics ) and they came out good enough to blow up from the small wallet size pic to a 3 " X5 " . The speed isn't the greatest , takes about 15-20 secs to boot up and about the same amount of time to scan , so probably not ideal for scanning a ton of pics .  
1	  This photo is so promising . Unfortunately , it stops there . The adapter - in terms of volume - is larger than the stock AC adapter that ships with the Vaio SZ Series . It also weighs more . The only upside is the cord from the computer to the adapter is short and tucks in - but as another reviewer pointed out - this means that you have the AC adapter near you at all times , and not discretely off your lap or desk . In short , it 's much larger than you might expect from the photos . If you 're looking for a cool little AC adapter for travel , this isn't it .  
1	  Sure the floppy is great for ease of use , but do you want to spend three hundred dollars on a camera with a resolution of less than one megapixel ? A floppy disk holds 1.44 megabytes , a 2.0 megapixel camera takes a picture that is about . 9 megabytes .  
1	  OUR HUB OVERHEATED AND MELTED AND WOULD HAVE STARTED A FIRE IF WE HAD NOT FOUND IT WHEN WE DID . WE BOUGHT IT 6 WEEKS BEFORE IT OVERHEATED AND THE ELECTRICAL CORD WAS PLUGGED IN AN OUTLET-OUTLET WAS FINE-UNIT DEFECTIVE .  
2	  I tried this with my new desktop computer that 's running Windows 7 Professional ( 64 bit ) - it works . I bought this USB external floppy drive because the floppy drive in my old computer stopped working . That old desktop runs the Windows XP Professional operating system . The floppy a : drive would show in My Computer but would not work . When I plugged the USB external floppy drive into one of my USB ports , it showed in My Computer as Floppy b : drive . I was able to read and write to the floppy disks . It works .  
1	  It 's about $ 7 for a reason .. Unless you hate using the headphones offered by airlines , do NOT buy this item . Wayy too loose ; felt like having a a large shopping bag handle behind my head , the audio wasn't loud enough to drown out the crowd / train nose in the subway ; at all , and just by looking at it you can tell that a newborn could break it in half . Audiophiles , beware of this item .  
2	  I 've got one of these and it is just fine . Run time surpasses OEM battery costing $ 70 because my digital voltage meter tells me it takes a higher charge . Alas , $ 5.95 eBay batteries with less elegant finish seem also to work almost as well , though they are generally do not include any kind of warranty ( save initial failure ) . Any of them give me several hours of shooting with lcd on . With it off they go forever . Here 's the issue . What is the service life for these batteries ? They claim hundreds of recharges and no memory loss - fair enough - but some writers claim that a Lithium battery of this type begins to die the minute it is born and may not make it past two years or so . Clarity is needed on this issue because more and more of us are dependent upon lithium proprietary batteries . My trusty NiMh 's , which power other cameras , seem to have very long life spans ( albeit with some deterioration of run time ) , even into their fifth or sixth year . I would recommend that Li Iion battery makers put manufacturing dates on their batteries and in their advertising . A postscript : This battery started to fail after a year . It was replaced without question by the manufacturer .  
2	  The Coby unit is an attractive , compact and easy to operate system and was just what I was looking for .  
1	  As soon as I received the product I installed it and the card did not start . I tried all the slots available and the card did not start . I moved the fax modem to another slot and placed the card in this slot and the card started the first time and the second time it did not start . As result I am returning it .  
1	  When I saw this laptop bag in the store , I was excited to finally find a stylish laptop bag . I bought it to use it for carrying my travel laptop to conferences . Three months ( 4 conferences and at most 14 days of use ) later , the first strap broke and I almost dropped my laptop on the marble floor . The chique design is unfortunately not enough to cover the lousy quality .  
1	  I bought these for my small kids to listen to movies on the plane . They don't care much for earbuds . The sound on these old things are horrible . Keeping in mind that the plane can be hard on the ears for sound qulaity . You get what you pay for . :)  
2	  I was very skeptical to puy my 3K + money into a TV if it wouldn't be worth it . i did a lot of online research going through lot of HDTV Reviews especially DLP ones because I wasn't interested in Plasma / LCD etc because of their few well-known prolems and comparatively higher-costs . Initially was interested in Samsung6163 but later thought of 5674 but because of higher / better features-to-Cost ratio I settled with Toshiba 62HM94 . For last 5 weeks , I have been proud owner of this fabulaous jewel . I have hooked it up with my Onkyo NR801 Receiver and Infinity TSS1100 speakers and a simple cheaper progressive-scan DVD player ( with Component Video and Digital Coaxial / Optical output ) . And i don't need to go to a Theater anymore . Excellent unbelievable ( more that I had expected ) picture quality which mattered me most in my selection , Audio was too pretty good but I am using my home-theater setup . It 's pretty light-weight ( 100 lbs ) and compact size . Only 1 thing I found in Samsung and wished Toshiba too could have .. Slim Bezel and TV-speakers at bottom instead of sides . I am very happy with Toshiba which delivers standard digital-cable signal as good that I can think of what if I drop my plan to subscribe HDTV ..  
2	  Bought this receiver since it has pre-amp output . Needed this feature as I am using wireless speakers ( JBL ) for the surround channels . The wireless speakers have their own amplifier and cannot be used with full amplifier outputs . This feature is only found on more expensive receivers from any manufacturer . To find it on a receiver retailing for $ 300 is quite a surprise . Of course the trade off is the lack of HDMI but I am not aware of any receiver processing the audio part of the HDMI connection . Based on other reviews , I am sure it will sound good when it arrives . Manual is huge .  
2	  I took these to the 2012 Olympics and they were awesome . I 'm not too steady , so the stabilization was fabulous . A bit heavy and certainly expensive .  
1	  The battery I recieved was a DMW-BCE10PP .. it does not fit the camera .. it 's too BIG . Why in earth would amazon put these together is beyond me .. now I have to find out how to return it . Amazon is usually so good about this .  
1	  The headphones are fine for sound - no complaints there , but they pinch my ears worse than any other headphone I 've tried .  
2	  The camera comes with a comprehensive and easy-to-follow instruction manual for people ( like me ) who don't have too much experience with a Canon SLR . It comes with its own battery charger , so there 's no need to buy another one unless you want to keep a spare someplace . The camera was a little heavier than I anticipated since I was used to the weight of the 35mm Rebel . From other reviews , I thought the camera would be quite small , however it 's a pretty good size . I do agree with others that the size is more suited for smaller hands . The shutter noise was also much louder than I expected , so I won't be taking any photos in quiet , public settings ( the reason I gave 4/5 stars ) . However , the quality of the photos you get is excellent . I chose to get the EF-S 17-85mm f / 4.5-5.6 IS USM and theEF 70-300mm f / 4.5-5.6 IS USM lenses . Both are great lenses for beginners without having to sacrifice picture quality . There are many examples of photos taken with those lenses from dpreview .  
2	  I have taken many many pictures on this card . It runs very fast in my SLR , and is a very good card . SanDisk makes some good stuff . I get very fast Bursts of pictures in my Canon SLR , and overall , the card has performed great ! I would totally recommend this .  
2	  This Clarion equalizer is the best I 've ever had . I don't even have a head unit hooked up to it . I just run my ipod straight into it . The sound is powerful and clean . The soft blue illumination that glows from behind the knobs is very nice and not overpowering at night . The connections are all gold-plated so they conduct all the power and sound to it 's maximum potential . LOVE THIS PRODUCT !  
1	  We have ruined two microwaves using this popper . After the first microwave burned up ( using the microwave popper ) we thought that because the popper was several years old we needed a new one . So , we bought a new microwave and a new popper . We used both for about 6 months and the same thing happened . It 's the Presto popper ! And I have had to buy two new microwaves ! When my mother 's microwave burned out I asked her if she had been using the Presto popper and she said that she had . It has now burned out 3 microwaves . I do not feel that it is safe and will not buy another .  
1	  I 've had this system for about a year now , and while it 's still holding up well , I 've found it to be consistently mediocre . The sound isn't great-to me , it sounds somewhat muffled , and there 's no way to equalize the sound . There are no sound controls besides on , off , and volume up or down . The CD player often has trouble recognizing discs , especially CD-Rs , and often won't play them . Even with " store-bought " normal CDs , the CD often turns and turns and turns before the player will finally read it . I 've never had a CD player that had so much trouble reading discs . I 'm already shopping around for a new stereo , which I think is a shame . I was seduced in by the esthetic of the thin speakers , but they 're contrasted by the bulky subwoofer that isn't shown in all of the pictures , and which ruins the look . And as other reviewers have noted , you lose all presets and even the time when you turn off the subwoofer , so I wonder how much I could save on my electricity bill if I could turn it off ? It was a purchase made in haste that I regret . One star is for the flat speakers , which still are kind of cool , and the fact that it charges my iPod while it 's docked . The other star , I suppose , is for simple durability-after a year , it 's still functioning , but at that price shouldn't it be ?  
1	  Anko claims that this mouse is Mac-compatible , which is only partly true . The included CD does not include a driver for Mac , and when I emailed the company , they directed me to shareware drivers , for which there is a fee , and when I tried one ( USB Overdrive ) , the mouse only worked as a normal one-click mouse , and the scroll button didn't work . The much-vaunted vibration effect was completely absent . The other alternative offered by the company was to return the mouse . In addition , I bought the mouse as part of a full-rebate offer in September . It is now late January , and I still have not received my check . A look at their web-page reveals that no one has received a check for this rebate yet . To sum up , buy Anko and AVB products at your own risk !  
1	  We bought the 30GB video iPod last Christmas ( 05 ) and on day 100 ( 10 days out of warrenty ) the screen spontaneously cracked from the inside , without being dropped or mishandled . It literally went into the pocket OK and came out a few minutes later broken ! Again , there was nothing that should have caused it to break ! And , there is no exterior damage or scratching whatever . From reading posts at Apple and elsewhere , it is very common with this model . Beware ! We took it to the local Apple store in Tampa and fortunately in our case it was declared caused by an internal " thermal " problem that cracked the inside glass layer . The tell-tale sign were large " ink spot " looking marks on the screen , being only cracked inside-the outer plastic layer was perfect , and absolutely not external damage evident . Got a new iPod . Apple didn't quibble about being a little past the 90 days .. and now we have 180 days from the orginal purchase . A great prduct but two stars because of the self-destructive nature of the video iPod 's ( like the Nano before ) screen .  
2	  I am very pleased with this camera . I especially like the light meter that tells you how many apertures you are away from the correct exposure . I am using this for my photo class and is easy to use .  
1	  I read the reviews for both the " silent " and non-silent version of this power supply and decided to spend the extra cash for the quiet version . The silent power supply functions fine , but it is by no means silent or even quiet . It 's very loud . I can't imagine how loud the non-silent version is . The stock powersupply that came with my PC 's case was much much quieter than this " silent " coolmax . If I had it to do over again , I would buy something else . I may even shop around for another and just keep the Coolmax as a spare .  
1	  I bought this camera a couple of years ago , and had problems with the auto focus . About a year ago the battery cover wouldn't close all the way due to a broken tab in the cheesy cover . Well I just sent it in to be repaired , and guess what they want $ 150 to fix it . That 's almost half the price of the camera for a 10 cent item and probably all of 15 minutes to fix . I won't be getting it fixed ( I 'll tape it shut ) , and I won't ever buy another camera from Minolta . Let the buyer beware . Stay away from Minolta unless you like spending your money on repairs .  
1	  I 've just bought MR814V2 for a week . it was really good in the first 2 day . After that , it make the internet connection much slower . I tried to test by using command ping ww . google . com . With MR814 , both wired and wireless , the packet lost 30 % . When I tested my internet connection without MR814 , it worked perfectly with 0 % packet loss . Moreover , upgrading the newest fimrware doesn't help .  
2	  The flash on my Nikon D40 stopped working for some reason , which seems to be a common problem for owners of this particular model . Between buying an external flash for the D40 or buying a new SLR altogether , I opted for the former . The flash works simply and easily , and is much brighter than the camera 's built-in flash ever was . The pictures turn out better as well . Thankfully it works really well , since having this flash prevented me from having to buy another SLR . Considering a new camera with new lenses and other miscellaneous equipment could have run into the thousands , the cost of this flash ( just over $ 100 in total ) was well worth it for me . I 'd recommend this flash to anyone whose D40 is having flash problems .  
2	  This is a great product if your experiencing low signal strength from your cable modem or less than perfect TV reception . The Motorola signal booster is pretty much plug and play . The second I plugged it in , my signal strength increased by 15db . I have a more stable internet connection and my television reception is much clearer throughout the house .  
1	  I didn't not like this at all . It was clunky and got in the way of my gearshift . I returned this product and got a great belkin instead !  
1	  I have a very bad experience with Casio .. I bought this camera less than one year ago . I seldom use it , and just leave it in my drawer . Recently there is one button doesn't work , so I sent it back for repair . And they charge me >$ 100 . So , I did nothing to the camera , it doesn't work , and they charge me >$ 100 , though it is still within warrant !  
1	  This unit is AWFUL ! We spent a combined total of at least 10 hours working with this thing before finally feeling pure discust at the time we 'd wasted so went and bought the Apple i-touch instead ( which worked amazingly well right out of the box with absolutely no learning curve required ) . Some people may have the time and interest to work with the thing and have great results , but I can think of MANY things I 'd rather be doing with my time then that . I 'm not a techno-idiot , I 'm often the person people come to when they need help with something technical ( computer , software , etc . ) That being said , I 'm not a trained Techie type either - but historically it 's a rare electronic product that I can't figure out with a minimal amount of time . Not so with this thing ! Unless you are super techno-savvy with time to spare I 'd pass this thing on by . It would be one thing if they actually offered decent support for it , but if you 've read any of the other reviews at all , the support number is pretty much useless . Take Home Message : Don't buy this unless you 're a super-techie with nothing better to do than spend hours figuring the thing out . If you want something that " goes " right out of the box , pick a better known brand .  
1	  I have 1 GB of RAM and a Pentium processor and Broadband service . Normally my computer is pretty darn fast in all things . It took 41 hours to back up my C : drive . That amounted to 12 GB of data . After the back up my computer practically ceased to run . I unplugged the unit ; no help . I finally had to uninstall all the software for my computer to return to normal . It has been a nightmare . All the info is securely stored but I can't imagine what it would do if I ever actually needed to use it to restore this to my computer . I really wanted to use the sync function but since I can't keep it installed that is not possible .  
1	  I never received my battery I had to wait 21 days before I could file a claim . I am waiting for the claims paper to come so I can mail it back to the company . Then after all that 's done they will submit the claim wasted time and no product .  
1	  The reason this got a one is because you could get the Palm IIxe for the same price . I first got a visor delux and from the start I realized problems , first you can not upgrade the system ( but you can with the Palm IIxe ) . Secondly , the blocky shape can get annoying ( where as the Palm IIxe has a nice smooth and rounded shape ) . The modules are such a pain , I mean we paid enough for the unit , now we need modules ? The Visor dulex is a great unit , there 's no doubt about that , but why get that when you could have the much better Palm IIxe , or the TRGpro . This is just a warning , this is not worth the money , get the Palm IIxe , you 'll be sorry if you don't . By the way , Palm makes much better add ons for thier products , and service just isn't quite the same with handspring . I switched to the Palm IIxe for the reasons above , I don't think I need any other explaination .  
1	  It leaves a shadow and bright hot spot light . I need a larger flash with indirect flash to avoid hot spot .  
1	  Does not work with the item that it sells . Why sell them together ? Buy a cordless phone and this item has nowhere to connect .  
2	  I purchased a half-dozen of these to enable me to insert wide plugs and wall-warts into closely-spaced power strip outlets . Manufacturers often space outlets very close together in order to save money . These extension cords allow you to utilize all the outlets on a power strip . Despite being very inexpensive , they are made very well .  
1	  I think Microsoft just wanted to get the Zune on the market before Christmas . The main reason I bought the Zune was for the video capabilities , the larger screen and I already own the Orignal IPOD . You cannot sync up your Windows Media Center recordings to your Zune at this time . Why do I need a Zune then ? Really dispointing ! There are no podcasts or videos on the Zune marketplace . I am going to be patient and see if Microsoft releases some kind of firmware improvement in the next three months . If I see no improvments Apple IPOD here I come .

1	  Bought as a Christmas gift so my husband could have pictures of our grandchildren to carry with him , this has now sucked three hours out of my life and is in the trash . It wasted more time than money for me . I 'm not an idiot , but I can't make it work . If someone who knows how to use computers can't make it work , then the problem isn't with the user . Amazon shouldn't be selling this piece of crap . No one should .  
1	  Used a 360 for two years , was generally happy with it . Then , satellites started going away after it was on a minute or so . Found instructions on the internet on how to crack the case open yourself . Was able to do that , but couldn't see anything wrong . Might come in handy when the internal battery dies . Based on experiences others have posted , tried the cheap $ 11 external antenna . Worked great . Nice unit , small with a strong magnetic mount . Have a friend with a 350 , he has the flakey power switch that others have reported . I 've been a long-term Garmin fan , starting with a GPS 12 , but really disappointed in how the quality has gone down as they try to compete in the cheap sat-nav market . At this point , no reason to be buying a 300 series , the 200 series are cheaper and maybe don't have these two issues . Time will tell .  
2	  I bought these because of the good reputation of Taiyo Yuden . However , they are not marked Taiyo Yuden anywhere , pretty generic packaging . When tested with Nero , they did reveal a Taiyo Yuden code and they are a little thicker than other DVD-R 's and slightly rounded on the edge . I 've never had a burning error with them ( 60 discs ) and I tested a few discs after burning with Nero and they got very good marks . I compared them with the Memorex DVD-R 's I had been using and they rated about the same . Taiyo Yuden reportedly use superior dyes and have a long-life . The discs are definitely a little sturdier or thicker than most any other . The only problem I 've had with them is that my Lite-on DVR 5045 will not read any of the discs . They play fine on my Philips , LG , or the PC ( Samsung ) , but not on the DVR . Pros : Quality manufacturer brand ( Most name brands are outsourced and quality can vary ) , Sturdy , Gives good quality burns . Cons : No brand marking , Won't play on my specific DVR but does play on 3 other DVD players with no problems .  
1	  This is a REVERSE wiring harness . It is a replacement harness for the stock wiring harness , NOT for connecting to an aftermarket stereo harness !  
2	  the sansa express is cool looking , and didn't want to cover it up with a colored case . The iClear by Griffin is great . Unfortunately I went to buy another one last night and it seems the price has significantly risen , so I will not be purchasing another one until it comes back down . But , if willing to pay , it is perfect .  
1	  I bought this for my newborn 's room , used only a few times , lasted less than a month . Called Coby , customer service rep was very rude ! Called back to speak w / a manager , was on hold for over 15 minutes so I hung up ! Will never buy their products !  
2	  I highly recommend this filter to protect your front lens element , I have owned two of these since 2009 and have not had any problems with scratching . The glass in this filter is top notch , when the glass is clean you cannot even seen the glass unless you hold it at a very steep angle , it just looks like a black ring so it does not impact your pictures . It does seem to collect dust fairly fast but since I have had this on all of my lenses since I purchased them I can't tell if the lens collects dirt as fast . The only problems that I have with it in fact is that the lens still seems to get dust collecting on it even with this filter always and if you tighten this on very hard it can sometimes be very hard to get off but that is so it will not fall off . In may of 2011 my camera ( a 5d with battery grip and flash ) fell off my 3 1/2 foot desk at work onto the floor and landed strait onto the front of the lens . The filter glass broke and the brass ring bent and jammed onto the camera lens , I tried for days to get it off and could not so I took it to a Canon repair station . I waited for 15 min and they got the ring off and check the lens with their camera and said everything looked fine . It may have been a pain when it broke but if this was not on my camera i would have broken the front element on my lens , it may seem overpriced but I will gladly keep one of these on every one of my lenses just to protect them .  
1	  i ignored the reviews that stated this portable cd player was a piece of junk . Well , surprise , surprise .. it is a piece of junk . Broke about 5 min . after i unpacked it ! Played three songs on a cd and I heard a pop sound and the smell of an electrical fire . YES , I said electrical fire ! I should have known something was up because before each song played , it made a honking sound . Thought it was the CD , but apparently not . DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME and MONEY !  
1	  I took approximaly 5 hours to back up ~ 20 G of hard drive information using the fire wire interface . The software was easy to use , Although none of this really matters since the hard drive was no longer recognized by any of my 3 computers after 4 days ! Not wanting to give away 20 G of hard drive data ( i.e. by sending it back for repairs ) it was a complete waste of $ 190 not to mention my time .  
2	  This case is awesome . It 's a perfect size and I suspect that with some use will be even better . The leather is soft and as it gets used , I think that it will contour to the camera . There 's plenty of room for my S5 IS Power Shot as the camera strap is meant to be used as the strap for carrying the camera while it 's inside the case . The zippers are on the sides allowing for the strap to be on the outside . There 's definitely room for a film card or 2 in the inside pocket , and with all that , there 's no excessive padding to bulk up the case unnecessarily . I am very satisfied and would definitely recommend it . In fact , I think I will recommend it to a friend with the same camera .  
2	  I 'm just getting into back photography after 25 years . I received this as a gift and was overwhelmed at first . But in no time I was having a ball with this and how easy it was to use . Love the lens !  
2	  I bought these to use in my 1999 Luxus LS400 . They work great , just like orginal equipment . And they are not $ 80 each !  
1	  I 've been transcribing with an Olympus for six years . I needed another machine , so I bought the Sony M-2000 .. not a great product for the money . Even if you have the volume turned all the way up to 10 ( highest ) , you can't hear the person very well and there 's a muffled quality , even with the tone on high . I can't believe the difference in the quality of sound between the two . I 'm disappointed with the Sony , and I actually bought it because I thought Sony would be better ! Ha !  
2	  I regret trying the " Easy setup " wizards . Once I went the manual route , things went smoothly . I wasted at least an hour trying to do it the " recommended " way . Since then , it 's been operating very well . I use VOIP and WebEx and high speed cable . This unit outperforms my previous router , which was about 8 years old .  
1	  I must have gotten a defective pack of these or something , because the first one only actually burned half of my songs to the disc , and all the CD 's after say that they aren't blank when I try to burn music to them . Is there something I 'm doing wrong cause this has never happened when I 've tried to burn music before .  
2	  Some discribe them as a little quiet , which I understand , but they are fine for me . The sound quality is suprisingly good at this low price .  
2	  Bought this for my old TV that has problem with the speakers . Virtually all micosystem type stereos have no additional AUX inputs other than this stereo . This is a great way to hook up your Ipod instead of buying some Ipod specific speaker system . The unit itself is nice looking ( ojective ) and the remote control works well and looks nice as well . I did not buy this on Amazon and paid a lot more .  
1	  The whiBal white balance reference card is a very small ( 3.5 " x2 " x0.4 ) " gray card " with a black and white target stuck to it . If you are having white balance problems , I don't think that this will be the " holy grail " and solve all your problems . It 's very small and as such can only be used for post processing . Let 's face it , the practically of use this card as intended is almost none . Who has the time to take samples shots every time you change the scene or lighting ? In a studio or on an outside set where you control the lighting the WhiBal reference card could serve some practical use ; however , remember it 's just a tool . The kit comes with the gray card , a holder , a ultra-thin carry case , and lanyard . The entire OEM cost is probably very low , thus in my opinion overpriced . I would suggest that if you think that white balance is an issue with your shots , check on ways to set the white balance on the camera . Why take a bad shot and depend upon post processing-RAW or JPEG . I use post processing to tweak an already good shot or adding effects . There are many others out there that are larger , that can be used for setting the camera white balance and post processing and cost one-half to one-third the cost of this kit .  
2	  This product has performed as expected . It is just the right size to carry what you might want to bring with you on a week vacation . The camera and lens are well isolated , protected , and the zipper front hold just the extras you are apt to take on the jaunt . Having had gone to something a little larger , my wife took it over with her smaller Kodak format camera and is pleased that all her goodies are available in one smaller sized unit .  
1	  The sound quality of this product is wonderful but if I just put my head down to see what I am sewing in my lap , it falls off . If I am cooking and I glance down , it falls off . This is ridiculous . Do they not test these ? I would not buy this product again . What good is good sound quality if they are sitting on the floor ?  
1	  With 9 cordless phones in the house with the original batteries ( 4-5 years service ) starting to go , the time had come to replace them all . THESE REPLACEMENT BATTERIES STINK ! After less than a year 's worth of service , they make the phone start beeping with the LOW BATTERY signal in as little as an 11 minute conversation . With one recent conversation ( less than an hour ) I had to switch phones 3 times . I will not order these again , and I suggest you don't either .  
2	  Got it for my wife . She loves it . Gets extreme use and has held up great  
1	  I got this as a present . Connected with a modem to the Net . Got through . Things were okay and downlaoded some nice applications . Then suddenly within a month the screen broke , and I don't even know how . I certainly do not remember mishandling it . Compaq wants big money to fix it . I gave them a piece of my mind about the flimsy screen and they said they cannot give me a free screen when they have been charging others . Is Compaq making a profit from replacing screens ? I gave it away to a techie friend who is going to get the screen fixed or do something else with it ; he told me CE devices are not bought by people in the know . Finally I decided to shell out for the famous PALM VII . I then realized that the whole world is providing all sorts of software and utilities to run on the PALM , most of it exclusively for PALM OS . But that is not Compaq 's fault that PALM OS dominates the software written for PDAs . But until you have had a PALM you dont know what you have been missing . Also PALM lets you do lots more browsing thru clipping . I even signed up to trade stocks with my PALM ; sorry again for Windows CE users - major brokers only provide this on the PALM . Basically I like to use the PDA for more than just inbuilt functions ( I am a semi-techie ) and that is where PALM is worth it - PALM OS gets you loads of fun free applications and utilities . And of course PALM screens are made to last .  
1	  I plugged the unit in and it came on fine . It zapped one bug and never worked again . The light comes on and goes off just fine , but it hasn't killed another bug . I brought it in to see if I could find a shorted fuse or wire , but it has no user serviceable parts . I intend on buying a Flowtron after reading the other bad reviews . This particular Stinger was purchased at Lowe 's Hardware as a gift . I don't think one bug is worth $ 60.00 . I intend on trying to get Honeywell-or whoever the manufacturer is-to replace it or give me a part and a service manual . I can take a ventilator apart and put it back together , so this item should be a snap ! Think they 'll do it ? Doubtful !  
2	  After looking into a camcorder with DVD capability and the flexibility of good still photos , I decided to go with the Canon DC40 . It has everything I wanted and is easy to use , at least up until this point ( I haven't transferred photos or movies to my computer ) . The only drawbacks that I have noticed is that battery must be charged by plugging in the camera so you 're unable to use the camera while charging your second battery and the battery life if you take stills does not last very long . You can purchase a separate charger ( approx $ 20 ) . Photo quality is great and DVD quality is great . Indoor settings you have to remember to check lighting or use the flash . I don't have much of basis to compare it to , but I do love the camera . It beats carrying a camcorder and still camera and the picture quality is no comparison from older generation cameras . Definitely something to have with small children .  
1	  Quality for dark photos and shadows is poor . Dark areas come out with uneven / banded colors . It seems like the severity of the problem changes with where you place the photo on the scanner . The best area I 've found is at the top of the bed near the lid hinges . I 'm going to exchange mine to see if it is a problem with my specific unit .  
2	  I recently received this Sony receiver and am very pleased with it . The hook up was quick and easy and the owners manual is well-written . I wanted something specifically with Optical sound inputs and this unit has not one , but two of them , along with a digital coaxial input port . The first thing I did upon hooking up this receiver was to play a DVD which I had just recently played on my non-optical receiver that I am replacing . Let me tell you .. I started hearing sounds from this DVD that I never heard before ! I just stood in the middle of the room laughing at the amazing sound that was now coming from my speakers ! I now know what true 5.1 surround sound is supposed to sound like . The channel separation was amazing and the multiple output modes ( movie , music , concert hall , etc . ) were fun to play with . I am able to tell this receiver exactly how far away from the speakers I am sitting and even tell it if the rear channel speakers are sitting high or low . This receiver has a large variety of customizable features that are simple enough for a novice like me to understand and program . The price is great , the features are great and I am completely pleased and cannot imagine upgrading again for a long , long time .  
2	  I am a bit perplexed by the odd reviews this camcorder has gotten .. Personally , I am very happy with mine .. no real problems .. of course , I don't profess to be a geek ..  
1	  I bought one of these cute little players because of the recommendations off another MP3 site . When it arrived , the first thing I found out was that it wasn't that little or that cute . it looked more like a pager from 1982 . After 6 attempt at installing the software on my desktop computer I gave up and managed to install it on the laptop instead . That didn't help much in downloading songs to the player , it hung on the second song download every time . I had to buy an adapter for the CF card so that I could download songs directly to the card . Once I did get a few songs on the player its sound was OK , but no better than he Genoa MP3 CD I bought laster year . The last straw happened a few days later . I had attached the eGo to my belt while out running errands . I tuned the player off while I picking up a few items in a drugstore . On leaving the store I went to start the eGo but it wouldn't play . Due to a moronic design flaw , the Ego 's card slot is open and on the bottom of the player so when it was attached to the belt clip the CF card had fallen out and was lost . I gave the player one last shot and tried 2 of the 128mb cards I use for my digital camera but neither would play in the eGo . Apparently , the devise only support a very limited number of cards on the market . The only help I got from the company in response to several email about the software problems was , " Did you read our web site ? " My advise to you is find a player with a little more thought behind it .  
1	  The cable was defective and the cost to send it back for a replacement isn't worth it . You 're best off just going to a local store to get one .  
1	  Literately i have only used this printer approximatley less than 10 times to print out basic stuff and to make a copy or two , i purchased it a couple of years ago , but it has just been sitting there most of the time , and the machine just died on me . Two days ago i was using my PC and i turned on the printer , and it did turn on just fine . About 20 minutes i began to print and windows said it was offline , then i went to this printer and it was turned OFF , i tried unplugging the power cord for 20 minutes with the same result , then i left it unplugged during the whole night and in the morning it was still dead . VERY disappointing ! I am hoping it is the power supply that is bad because i can buy that for around $ 40 dollars or so and it is very easy to replace . I was not expecting this from Canon . If anyone has information as to what the problem might be i will appreciate your input .  
2	  This carrying case for my Magellan RoadMate is much more snug and secure than a soft , bag-type case . The RoadMate fits perfectly and the snap-down cover is secure and positive . The case also is superior at preventing scratches and wear . This was an excellent purchase .  
1	  I was pretty sure this should connect to my blackberry pearl using bluetooth , which it did , but nothing good happened after that . Just gave me this error - Signal too weak to pinpoint location . I tried my best to get it to work from a variety of places during different times of the day - but it 's a useless piece of plastic now . My GPS device is from MS Streets and Trips 2007 . Update : It started working after Google Maps were updated . Still has trouble occassionally with syncing BT , but overall I am ready to give it 4 stars .  
1	  BEWARE ! I bought this hunk of junk in July ' 03 . One month after the one-year warranty expired , it quit . " Disc error " after recording a three and a half hour football game ! Now I put a disc in , it says either " No disc " or something about the format being unrecognizable . I put in a factory recorded disc-The Matrix-and I get " No disc . " I haven't tried the firmware update yet , but from reading other reviews here , I have little faith it will work . I agree with another fellow that Philips should recall these units . They are complete JUNK !  
2	  I struggled with all the options of digi cams . I 've never taken lots of pictures , so I read up everything from CCD size to megapixels to apperatures and shutter speeds . I determined brands . Sony was out due to the limitation of its ( proprietary ) Memory Stick . Olympus was the front runner with options , models , features , and lowest prices . Canon was second . I started to like the features on the Canon PowerShot S230 . .. Put simply , this is some of the best money I 've EVER spent . I come from an industrial design background ( sort of ) ; and it is rare I ever say a product is nearly flawless in design , function , and value . Trust me . If you can only spend $ 200 or $ 250 on a camera , save up your rainy day funds . Wait another month or two . Drop $ 400 and never worry about a camera again-period . You 'll be happy for the 3.2 ( true-not rated ) MP 's when you start shooting . Images are so good , you 'll want to have a good printer like the Canon i950 ( 4800x1200 dpi ) . Images enlarge to 8x10 perfectly . Never buy film again . Change between 50 and 400 ISO frame to frame . Black and White is fantastic . Sepia has that old world quality perfect for some pics of New Orleans . The long shutter speed allowed me to shoot some cool shots that are " instant Desktops " for my Mac . Downloading 's a breeze . Bottom line . The S230 is a feature rich camera . It 's size allows me to take it everywhere with me . The Olympus D-5550 I assure you would not fit in my Triple5Soul cigarette belt-pouch . My flash covers AT LEAST 15 ' of throw . The only downsides ? Sometimes I need to fiddle with settings for a minute or two to get them right for a shot . I mean : set ISO , white balance , light metering , color setting / b & w . ; Then there 's always the movie setting . Took lots of video of my dog playing outdoors . But hey ! I wanted more features and control over shots , right ? For the first time , I have it . Oh , the " red eye reduction " feature doesn't work as well as I might 've hoped . Yes , it 's only a 2x optical zoom . That 's the limitation of such a compact camera . I do wish it was a 4x-6x ( 3x wouldn't make that much difference ) , then I remember I probably wouldn't be lugging that monstrous camera and couldn't be holding it right then . I 'm just glad I didn't buy a Nikon F1 or Canon AE-1 a few years ago . The 35mm camera would sit while my compact Canon travels . All these positive ratings aren't wrong . It would be a mistake to buy anything else .  
2	  The DV-HR300U is a fabulous product . VERY easy to setup and use . The manual can look a bit intimidating at first , but it is fairly well written for as much as it 's trying to cover and if you are at all comfortable just diving in and pressing buttons , then the manual becomes more of a reference book since the on screen prompts are pretty much self-explanatory . Sharp isn't usually known as being the best in home A / V , but I have to say this unit seems to be built quite nice ( the remote is absolutely hideous though ) and it 's features and performance are on a par with any of the " higher end " manufacturers . I haven't had any trouble recording to HDD or DVD , everything works just like it should , right out of the box . I suspect that if you are having as much trouble as some seem to have you might have a bad machine , as everything I have tried so far ( recording from satellite , and camcorder to HDD then dubbing to DVD ) has worked flawlessly and the picture and sound have been spectacular . It will not copy commercial , copy-protected DVD 's ( or VHS , I suspect ) by itself .. if that is your intention , you 'll need one of the devices by Sima to bypass the macrovision ( or one of the old APEX DVD players ) , or use your PC for copying DVD 's and keep all the menus and extras . I bought this when the price was $ 379 , but even at $ 449 , it 's a heck of a deal , especially when compared to the similar Panasonic models or the TiVo with DVD-R and there is no monthly fee . Easier than most VCRs to program to record . If you think you want / need it , get it , you 'll probably like it .  
2	  I have two pairs of these now , bought an extra pair for traveling with my wife . I have had the first pair over three years , use them daily . I think the sound is great , much crisper than most others for this price , they fit my ears well . No complaints .  
1	  Item delivered is not as advertised . Described as " Product Dimensions : 7 x 4.2 x 0.5 inches " Product is actually 2 " x 0.5 . The bag it came in is " 7 x 4.2 x 0.5 inches " This is a rip-off .  
1	  While the label says " .. Remote Control for iPod or iPod mini .. " , the fine print on the INSIDE says you ALSO need a " dock connector ( not included ) " . WTF ? I buy a product , then find out I needed something more ? Hard to believe that Amazon allows such craziness . Too late to get my $ back or I would 've already returned it . Good grief already .  
2	  These are so great ! I saw them in the Apple store about two years ago for a lot more money . For $ 40 on Amazon they were a super deal , which I pride myself on finding . I am really picky , but the are so pleasing to the eye ! Can you believe it .. speakers that double as sculptural elements ? ! The sound quality is quite good , especially if you 're used to speakers without a sub-woofer . The volume goes up quite high . I haven't even felt the need to turn them up enough to be at full blast . I will be using them with my laptop as well as my iPod . They will be replacing my big home stereo , which I 've hardly used since I got my iPod anyway . The power cord has quite a large " brick " attached . I hope I can hide it behind my desk or TV stand . Also , the on button is in a pretty awkward place ( behing the sub-woofer , among all the cords ) . I don't understand why they didn't put it on the left speaker where the volume buttons are on the right one . Still , I love them !  
2	  I have never been able to wear ear buds because they pop out of my ears . I guess they are made for the average male . The V-MODA earbuds come with three different attachments ; one being small . I can not only keep them in my ear but enjoy the great sound that I am getting from the quality . And other people in my family can still borrow them .. if I let them !  
1	  I picked up one of these units for work . I checked it out thouroughy and it seemed OK . I am a techie and have long work and personal issues with D-Link products . If they work , they work OK . If they do not work , you are on your own . Turns out that this unit is listed as " compatible " with all versions of Windows , including Vista . In reality , this is not true and it will not work with Windows 64 bit . I contacted D-Link tech support 3 times in early february via e-mail and phone ( not in the manual , had to dig on the net ) and they still have not responded . pay a little more $ and buy a slightly more expensive unit that has support .  
2	  I just recently got this GPS and had a full 3 days to test it out . Overall , I would say it 's a very good GPS unit but with some notable flaws . BACKGROUNDI was using a Garmin C330 that I got 2 years ago until it decided to bite the dust on me . Spent some time on-line looking at this product along with the Garmin NUVI models and TomTom models . I decided on this one due to its widescreen format , mp3 and video capabilities , and price . PROS - The presentation of this GPS unit is very slick . It is pretty thin and not too heavy . It has clean lines and is not over-cluttered with buttons and knobs . - The screen resolution is outstanding . When I first used it in direct daylight , it appeared " washed out " . However , I turned up the brightness on the unit and it was fine - much better than my previous Garmin GPS . In non-direct sunlight viewing and nighttime viewing , the resolution is outstanding with vivid colors and clear text . - The widescreen format allows more " real estate " to provide additional info including next turn , time / distance to destination , and even the song you 're playing ( if you 're concurrently using the MP3 player ) . - The GPS capabilities itself I would rank as average-to-above average . It locks in the signal fairly quickly - about the same as my Garmin . It does sometimes take awhile to calculate the route . That I found a bit annoying , but nothing unbearable . - I like the fact that you can drag the map around to be able to view upcoming streets , etc . My old Garmin couldn't do this - not sure if they have added that capability in new Garmin models . - Another great feature of the GPS is the ability to " touch " areas on the map to show business and resident addresses . For example , I " touched " a street corner near my house on the GPS map and it showed the 24 hour fitness gym and other businesses there . - It has a nice carrying case that makes it easy to carry around for optimal mobile use . - The battery life is very good . Not quite the 5 hours that Harman Kardon states but I got mine working for 4 hours . - The User Interface is intuitive , simple and effective . CONS - The GPS unit does not tell you if the destination is on the left or right side of the street . I found this rather annoying because it didn't give me ample time to get on the correct side of the road . Granted you can figure out what side it 's on based upon address , but I think it 's a simple piece of functionality that should be in most GPS units today . - You cannot turn off the navigation voice while listening to the MP3 player . Personally , I don't always like to listen to the turn-by-turn direction prompts . However , I wanted to listen to my MP3 's on the unit . Unfortunately , you can't have both . If you 're listening to MP3 's , you will get voice prompts ( no matter how low you set the volume mixer ) . - The sound quality of the MP3 is only average . From a company like Harman-Kardon , I was expecting a much better effort . I have an AUX input in my car and I tested 2 songs on both the GPS unit and my iPod . The iPod sounded far better . Granted , the mp3 playback is not the main purpose of the GPS unit , but still , I expect higher quality from this company . - The UI " hiccups " that the Amazon review stated were NOT due to pre-production software . I experienced the same thing . Sometimes , it would take the unit 5-8 seconds to respond to my request . Blame it on buggy " 1.0 " software I guess . Overall , I think this GPS unit was a good investment and I like most of its features . The few flaws it had are not " make-or-break " for me , but do make things a bit inconvenient . Hopefully HK will take some of this feedback into consideration when releasing their 2nd gen version . But overall , I think the HK guys did a great job in their first introductory GPS unit in the market .  
1	  Less weight ! only 21g instead 25 grams compared to the Original Canon battery . Tested this battery many times , only 75 % of capacity , die quickly ! the battery is made in china said has 1400mah but much less than 1120mah ! Not happy with this battery from SterlingTEK on Canon S100 camera , only 40 minutes of video at most !  
1	  I have had this printer for a couple of years . For a while it produced nice prints , although it did have some trouble feeding paper . However the print heads are now clogged and won't print properly even after loading brand new ink cartridges and running multiple cleaning cycles . All printouts have streaks and gaps and I have to print three or four pages just to get one good copy . And get this - every time you run a cleaning cycle on this printer it uses up about 10 % of the ink in EVERY cartridge . It costs about $ 100 to replace all the cartridges , so every time you do a cleaning cycle it costs you $ 10 ! Maybe you will have better luck than I did , but I do not recommend this printer .  
2	  I have actually ordered 4 of these . 1 for by the bed , 1 in the living room , 1 for work and 1 for the car . They all work great .  
1	  Just like several other reviewers , I experienced a sudden loss of signal in one channel - in my case , it came after about 10 months of light use . Not recommended !  
2	  Perfect length for what I needed it for . It works the way it should . Can't beat the price . I 've had no problems with the cable .  
2	  The SoundDock is everything I was hopping for and even more ! GREAT sound quality , the only thing that may look bad is the price but it 's totally worth it . Great product and I recommend it a lot . Thanks .  
1	  The cable does the promised job .. only at an annoying slow speed . A 4 bit transfer rate feels like time trip back to the old DOS days . A crossover cable can do a better job however both your machines have to be on the same workgroup . Never tried it with a domain . So if you have to Sync / transfer file to / from your home computer with your work computer you may have to switch back and forth between domain and workgroup .  
2	  These speakers turned out to be a fantastic deal . I can turn them up and can hear them throughout the house . Great subwoofer . Logitech x-230 2.1 2-Piece Dual Drive Speakers with Ported Subwoofer  
2	  This is a really great camera . Has a lot of features like autostitch and movie recorder ( has a built in microphone ) . Allows you to change picture settings like b / w , sepia .. Very convenient to carry around , fits into a pant pocket easily .  
2	  With the purchase of my new JVC camcorder , I also bought the larger than life battery for it . It more than doubles the recording and playback time over the origional battery . I recommend this product .  
1	  Hi everyone .. I got this one for my new blackjack . I was not interested in it because of the price but because I wanted something conventional wired handsfree for my phone without a bluetooth ( I think bluetooth is not yet accepted culturally and makes you look like a clown in meetings .. Anyway ! ) As soon as I got it .. I tried to plug it in my phone .. it wont plug in .. I was afraid I might damage my phone port connector .. Also even after connecting it makes a thundering sound whenever I change my ringtone or music or click website links .. I would say if you dont want to buy a bluetooth .. dont go for this one at least .. use handsfree speakers .. thats what I am gonna do !  
1	  I picked up one after my old Logitech mouse cord went bad . One thing I noticed off the bat ( which might not be a common technical problem ) was that the left and right buttons were not good . Clicking on something sometimes wouldn't work . The mouse button would " click " but onscreen it wouldn't register unless you actually pushed the button hard . Was very annoying and I quickly returned the mouse after testing it for a day or 2 . Is a narrow mouse also , I don't recommend it for people with large hands , it just doesn't feel smooth and natural . Get a wider one .  
2	  I originally bought an Apple Airport Express , which was great , but as it 's limited to playing only music through iTunes , I returned it for this item . Now I can stream online radio such as Pandora and play streaming video using other software to speakers elsewhere in the house . Pretty much plug and play connected to the laptop - just didn't realize initially I had to connect it from the laptop headphone socket to the 2 RCA jacks on the transmitter part , then connected PC speakers to it . The receiver is sat in the basement hooked up to an amplifier and in house speaker system , so both the speakers connected to the laptop via the transmitter and the speakers around the house are all playing . Only downside is having 2 units - one to the PC controlling the music and one elsewhere controlling other zones . No trouble with wireless as some have reported . It is recommended to keep the transmitter at least 3 ft away from your PC if it has wireless . For the current price , it can't be beat .  
2	  Bought 2 of these about a year ago .. One for my mother-in-law and one for me .. Setting up was a breeze .. It works great .. Wouldn't trade it for another .  
2	  I debated between investing in a used Airport card and the recent version of the Linksys WET54G ( version 3.1 ) in order to have my old G4 iMac connect to a wireless network . After reading this information ( search : plantphys . info / advice / wet54g ) , I decided to take the plunge and buy the Linksys product . The instructions from the website were great , and my G4 was connected to the network within minutes . The only modifications that I would make to the instructions on that website is to ensure you enable the encryption if it is present on your network and add the network 's password . One issue that I had with the adapter after it was running was that I needed to reset the adapter after I had turned off the computer and my wireless network when it was not in use . Once I upgraded the firmware to the most current version ( found on the North American website ) , this problem went away . If you upgrade the firmware , you have to click on the " help " tab during the installation process , which directs you to a page where you browse for the updated firmware file that you have already downloaded onto your computer or key drive . I gave this product only four stars because the company should have provided instructions for Macintosh users , and the process of upgrading the firmware was not as straightforward as it could have been .  
2	  I got this camera for my 18th birthday , last year . Since then I have taken over 3000 pictures with this camera . The video quality is alright , and can be difficult when making movies , but it is a camera , not a VIDEO camera . I was able to make a documentary video with this camera , but it was rather difficult once on the computer . I mostly edited the content on the camera . Such a nice feature ! The indoor does take a while to actually take the picture . For faster shutter times , hold the button half way down , until a green circle shows on the screen , then snap the shot . That use is better if you are waiting for something to happen . Everything else is great ! The firework selection does awesome artwork with different light-styles . I am ever-finding new things to do with the camera . It has been to camps and back , it has been to disneyland , and even horseback riding . The camera isn't small , but it is small enough to put in a pocket and sneak into Grad-Night ! The self-portrait selection goes over really well with teenagers today . An upgraded memory card is suggested . Overall , this camera is the best I 've seen out there . Great quality , HUGE LCD , and so many functions it is easy to get lost in the camera . :-) I love the calendar feature : the camera can store the pictures by what day the picture was taken on . Don't want to go looking for that one picture to show your mom ? Use the calendar and search through a lot less pictures !  
2	  Used this at a wedding for backup sound for video . It worked very well . My assistant learned how to work it on the drive to the wedding , pressed record and put it on the groom . It was simple .  
2	  I have had this system for eight months . I purchased it after reading reviews on Amazon site . Great buy and product . Easy to set up ( and I 'm no techno geek ) . System is located in a 12X14 room . My test DVD was " Top Gun " . I was blown away and hardly had the sound turned up half way ( 40 on the meter ) . Could not be happier with my purchase . Would highly recommend this product . A good current test DVD for someone buying today would be " Batman-The Dark Knight " . Super sound .  
1	  I bought this mic about a year ago for a sony SR7 , and when I mounted it on the camera I could barely tell the difference between it and the onboard mic . I recommend getting the RODE video mic that has significantly better sound quality . Also , the mic broke not long after I bought it . I really wasn't too disappointed though .  
2	  I originally bought a pair of these about three or four years ago for using in recording me talking in a podcast . It was with three other people and my voice always ended up the clearest out of all of them so I was always happy with it . Before I bought this , I had a lot of issues of ambient noise coming through no matter what I tried . Once I started using this , I NEVER had another issue with ambient noise again . I used it for that for about a year and a half and never had any issues at all . During that time , my husband needed a new gaming headset . Since I was so happy with this , I got him another one of these and he used it daily ( to my weekly ) . It was good for him while it worked . After about two years , it started having issues with the microphone connection and so I gave him mine to use instead . That one now is starting to have some crackling issues ( after four years of use ) so we 're in the market for a new one . I think for the money and the great use we got out of it , I am very happy with these . They were definitely the best we 'd ever used and I 'm sad to see them go .  
1	  I wanted to like this heating pad and I was sitting against it in bed reading , but my arm kept brushing past the hard plastic edges of the actual pad , which kept sticking out of the cover . This constant scratching was irritating . The sponge that you moisten is so thin that it tore the first time I tried to put in back in the cover . The length of the pad was however a good feature ,  
1	  I am very very disappointed with this mp3 player my husband paid over $ 200 for it 3 years ago and twice it has just stopped working . The 1st time we had to update the firmware which would not have been such an issue if almost 4,000 songs were not deleted in the process . I reloaded them once it was fixed and a year later it just stops syncing in the middle of a transfer . Then my computer that had the right software loaded on it will not recognize it . I have put the software on the other 3 computers in the house and none will pick it up . CREATIVE LABS WEBSITE NO LONGER HAS ANY SOFTWARE OR UPDATE MATERIAL ON THE WEBSITE . THEY SPECIFY IT IN DIFFERENT WORDING BUT THE SAME MEANING AS TOO OLD . I DONT KNOW ABOUT ANYONE ELSE BUT $ 200 + IS A LOT OF MONEY FOR THIS TYPE OF ITEM AND I EXPECT THAT IT SHOULD LAST LONGER . It will play but won't sync and every time I start it it has to spend 10 + minutes rebuilding the library . this year we bought from another company , paid less and the mp3 player also will play video . LOOK AROUND YOU CAN GET MUCH MORE FOR LESS MONEY FROM A LOT OF OTHER COMPANIES .  
2	  Logitech LX7 Cordless Optical Mouse - Dark Blue ( 931395-0403 ) I love it . It works great . I was tired of all the cords going to the computer so was looking for a good deal . Now am looking for a cordless keyboard .  
1	  One critical failure on Logitech 's part makes a near perfect keyboard useless . You cannot disable the double-click feature on the touchpad - and the touchpad is very sensitive . As a result you end up frequently double-clicking when you don't intend to . Had to return mine as a result . If you look on the Logitech support board you 'll see many posts about this issue . Logitech says it is a hardware limitation so don't count on a software fix . Very disappointing that Logitech Product Management didn't get it right on a critical feature . Recommendation - look elsewhere or wait until Logitech fixes this problem in a new version of the hardware .  
1	  the laptop only recognizes it as a usb 2.0 . the actual speed is no faster than usb 1.1 . I 've tried burning dvds , uploading flash drives and ipods . the device did not accomplish the job any faster than my usb 1.1 . maybe i don't have the right driver . in which case , the driver cd they include also sucks . it is nothing more than a compilation of all of the possible drivers that work for this specific hardware . difficult to figure out which driver is the right one . also , the ac adapter is not included . the power plug included has a usb plug at the end . you 'd have to use one of your own usb to power the darned thing . if i am the one at fault for not using the device friendly , then these people are at fault for not being user friendly .  
1	  I bought this camera and had to return it , because it was not worth a flip . I used it to record my daughter 's Christmas program a few weeks ago , and I was just lucky that I brought another camera . The image was so blurry , you cannot even see anything but fuzz . If I would not have brought our digital camera , I would not have any memories taken from this event . This camera is so unreliable . I would not recommend this to anybody but maybe a child who wants to use it as a play video camera .  
2	  Adds a extra demention to the case and a lot of goodies can be loaded and kept close but out of the way .. Great addition  
1	  It wasn't absolutely special and a need to have at all . All these things work pretty much the same and basically they really all suck . Radio stations , sound quality coming out of your speakers , it just sucks pretty much . Just go for the gusto and spend the money to have your car ( pre 2007 ) wired for a direct IPOD connection from your local radio / alarm / car electronics installation ladies . How yeww doinn ?  
1	  I did tons of research when I was loking for a NAS and this seemed to be the winner given its giga-ethernet feature and claimed FTP remote access ( I couldn't get it to work ) . The unit looks to be well made , and it connected itself to my network once powered on . I can map a drive to it , no problem . However , the utility software and documentation have to be the worst I have ever seen . The utility software looks like made by someone with just a couple of days of programming training , and the document doesn't match the software consistently . The worst part is the web-based Configuration Utility couldn't even come up . Without that , nothing can be configured . Called the so called 24x7 customer support line . Apparently my understanding of 24x7 support was wrong , only the automated voice system is 24x7 . After a long hold , I gave up and sent two emails using the form on the Buffalo Tech website , didn't get an acknowledgement in my email account . I called again two days later , after about 40 minutes of hold , finally got hold of a woman , who sounded very rushed . She asked me to power it off , press the reset button , and a combination of these , put me back on hold a couple of times so she could check with someone else . After 20 min , she gave up and told me it 's likely a firmware problem , and said they could replace it . I agreed ( though not sure what a replacement could do if it 's a firmware problem ) . What finally ticked me off is that she said I had to pay for the shipping for BOTH the new unit they were to send me AND the shipping for me to send this one to them . Uhh . So I returned it to the seller . I 'm an IT professional and thought that I wouldn't need help even though I already read that Buffalo Tech 's custom support is ridiculously bad . Boy , was I wrong . The hardware looks well-built but when it comes to human related stuff , like software usability , documentation usability and readability , and custom support , Buffalo Tech has to be the worst I can remember .  
2	  I paid $ 30 for a 6ft Vizio HDMI cable at Walmart before finding the Link Depot cables . First I picked up a 6ft , found out how well it works and bought two more . Also picked up the 25ft to use for connecting the laptop to the TV and it 's fantastic . I use them for Tivo , Blu-ray , gaming , and the laptop and the Link Depot cables work perfect for these applications . My son had just paid $ 70 at Best Buy for an 8ft HDMI cable for his new Xbox and I gave him one of these 6ft Link Depot cables and he promptly returned the overpriced ones . Buy these .. you won't be disappointed !  
1	  Just bought the camera a couple hours ago and now im packaging it back up to return . Looking at the camera , it seems like a good buy with the mp3 player and 5 mp but the pictures just come out horrible . The mp3 functions seems to work good . Would not recommend at all waste of money .  
2	  Great little case for the price . My Canon G12 with strap , extra SDHC flash card , extra battery , and Rocketfish card reader fit in like a glove perfectly . Good quality and came on time . I would buy this product again .  
2	  For ( .. ) bucks there is simply no way you will do better than this . After reading a review in Maximum PC I decided to give them a try despite hearing many horrible labtec speakers in the past . You cannot spend less than ( high price ) and come away with a better 3-piece speaker setup than this . Because of the price and great quality , I 'm even thinking of buying another set and hooking up a 4.2 ( 4 sats 2 subs ) setup .. Amazing subwoofer , great satellites , even more amazing price . Buy these now .  
2	  I bought this to mainly protect my lens . It does a great job at doing this , and , as far as I can tell , my photos are of the same quality as before . Even though B + W usually costs more than other filters , I feel it is worth it to spend the extra dollar on great manufactured glass . I would definitely recommend getting B + W filters for you lenses .  
1	  I bought these speakers and they broke over a year into it . I went to the Klipsch forums and saw a lot of people with failures .. and repeat failures after getting them repaired . They ( tech support ) wanted $ 90 dollars + shipping to repair . So I bought the Logitech Z5500 's and threw away the Promedia 's . Much better now !  
1	  I am on my third LinkSys wireless-G Model WRT54GS . The first one didn't work out of the box . After 2 hours with LinkSys tech support telling me the problem was my computer or my DSL modem , I gave up , exchanged the router for a new one and amazingly the new one worked . Two months later the router ceased to function . Again I called LinkSys , spent 2 hours with their tech support and got the same run around as the first time that I had called . Again the problem could not possibly be with their product . According to them the problem had to be my computer , my DSL modem , my ISP / DSL provider . LinkSys tech support insists that no other customers are experiencing failures of their routers . Tonight , my third router died and I cannot connect to the internet through the router either hard wired to the Ethernet port or with the LinkSys wireless card . As a matter of fact the wireless card does not even gat a " link " light . I tried to connect with another notebook computer using the built in wireless antenna and could not detect the router . I then tried to connect through the Ethernet port without success . I spent 2 hours on the phone with LinkSys tech support again tonight . After hours or changing settings and not being able to connect through the LinkSys router , the LinkSys tech again gave me the party line . " The problem has to be my computer , my DSL modem , my ISP / DSL provider . LinkSys tech support insists that no other customers are experiencing failures of their routers . I told the Tech that I was working with that I was sure that if I were to go out and buy another LinkSys router that it would work . I asked him if it did work would he agree that the one I currently have had died and is defective . I was told no ; It would only prove that the problem is with my computer , my DSL modem , or my ISP / DSL provider . When I asked him to explain his reasoning , he couldn't . I give up . Doesn't any company provide support anymore or do they just try to push their problems back off on the consumer ? Purchasing a LinkSys router has been the worst choice that I have ever made . I will not make that mistake again .  
2	  Good quality for a fair price on an item that is not as easy as it used to be to find .  
1	  broke on the third day sent back to sony haven't seen it since would look for somthing other then sony  
1	  I have just brought this FM transmitter . When the car is not moving , the quality seem to be okay . But when car is moving , it is very noisy . I regret for buying this transmitter .  
1	  do not buy refurbished mp3 player i bought it thinking it was a better deal but got ripped off mine quit working within a month ! do not buy refurbished  
1	  I sent a message to the supplier and Amazon asking for information about returning the product . Although the product was listed as in stock in California , and I live in California , it took one week for delivery . I received no reply on my request for a return .  
1	  Item is rather cheaply made and flimsy , but it does the job that is expected of it nonetheless .  
2	  The recorder has performed just as I expected . The sound quality is fine , the controls are intuitive and easy to operate , and battery life is acceptable . I especially like the three recording modes , so you can do dictation , record a one-on-one discussion or podcast , or a large lecture , and get good sound quality with the proper mode set . No complaints .  
2	  I bought this for my new 20 " LCD and I am very pleased . I was looking at the Omni Mount , which is about the same price . There were a couple of bad reviews for that one so I tried this one . I am glad I did . I am sure that is a good product , but this has a much better design . Unless the wall stud you are mounting the mount in is exactly in the middle of the spot you intend to mount the TV , you won't be happy with a cantilever type mount , pushed back flush against the wall , the cantilever mount will always rest the TV exactly where the stud is . This product allows much greater flexibility . The TV can be " offset " from the mounting base on either side so that you can center it on the wall when flush . It also does not have the " drooping " issue the reviews for the cantilever mount mentioned . The mount is very well made , I think it weighs more than the TV , and is attractive . If you want , you can even hide the wires in the tubes of the mount . My only complaint , mine didn't come with the mounting screws , but for less than $ 1.00 I bought them at Home Depot . I am very pleased and strongly recommend that you consider this mount for your TV .  
2	  When it comes to ink for my R1800 photo printer , I am concerned with the quality of the images I print . The Epson cyan UltraChrome Hi-Gloss ink cartridge provides superior resistance to water , fading and smudging . It is important to me that my prints are of high quality , so I don't attempt to use the cheaper compatible ink cartridges . The color can be duplicated , but all inks are not created equal . Third party options may produce a good print initially , but may not hold up or last as long . PROS : Provides superior resistance to water , fading and smudgingCONS : Price  
2	  I bought a router extender recently and it did not come with a patch cable to attach to my existing router . So on Amazon I went , scored this for much less than I would have paid at a local shop and got it in two business days with Amazon prime . Its a basic cable , it works perfectly .

2	  Not the fanciest of cooling fans i have seen , but love it having 3 fans to cover the entire bottom of my laptop , and it does what it is designed to do , cool , and great price , and besides that , you can't see the cooling pad once the laptop is on it . I have a HP G 60 , which does hang over both side a bit , but you can feel the air blowing out to the edges . The only thing that i was not 100 % pleased about , is that the lover edge of my laptop does not catch the lip on the pad , but that is because when the battery that came with the laptop gave out , i replaced it with a heavy duty one , that is not flush with the bottom of the pc . It protrudes about an inch and is probably the culprit . But the laptop sits there just fine without sliding off the pad , and so can be lived with .  
1	  About 3 weeks into gaming I heard static on the right side of the headphones , a week later I could hear more static . Now I hear noting on the right side . The microphone is medicore in quality and I dont think I will ever purchase this headphone again but for $ 20 their isnt much too lose unless you buy yourself 3-4 for the year .. Sorry Plantronics I give you 1 Star ..  
1	  I bought one of these at a local retail store . The keys scrape against the casing as you press them , so you have to press harder which strains the fingers and wrists . The enter key is especially difficult , as I have to jam my pinky finger down real hard in the center of the key . A lot of keyboards have issues with detecting multiple keys being held at the same time . But this is the only keyboard I 've ever seen that can't detect more than one arrow key being held at the same time , making some games unplayable . No diagonal scrolling in Starcraft , for example . I found a workaround , though : turn off numlock and diagonals will work . Better yet , just throw away this garbage . Quite possibly the worst Belkin product , and that 's saying something !  
1	  Please , don't buy from this seller . I 've sent e-mails to three different addresses trying to get an answer from them and have not heard back . First , the cartridge they sent was damaged upon arrival . A piece was broken off that allows the cartridge door to open when the printer is closed . Luckily , I still had my old cartridge and was able to switch the doors and have it physically working again . But the cartridge won't print correctly . After some research , I 've found it 's probably got a bad corona wire in it . The irony of it all is they include a card with the cartridge begging you to contact them rather than leave less than 5 stars . Never again .  
2	  I have had this little gadget for over a year now . I take it with me where ever I travel . Every night when I come back to the hotel or where ever I am staying I download to my laptop all the pictures I have taken during the day , without any problem . First I had an old laptop with Win 98 SE , now I have a new one with WIN XP Home Edition , and it keeps working as good as ever .  
1	  1 ) tip of the 12V power plug is broken when I open the box . Why quality control did not catch it before ship it out ? 2 ) the GPS software freezed up twice during my 3 hours long trip . Each freeze requires multiple hard resets to clear . each hard reset take 3-5 min to complete . I don't think the risk and I took and my time wasted with HGPS35 worth the money I saved .  
2	  Except for the hot plate being perhaps a little too hot , the Presto percolator delivers warm , well-brewed coffee in a jiffy . I normally use a French press , but in the winter it 's a bit too chilly for that , so the Presto became a handy substitute , and I can use my French press for measuring fluids .  
1	  I saw that these were reviewed relatively well for inexpensive buds amongst a large group of people ( and an older CNET article ) so I decided to give them a shot . I came away unimpressed , even with the low price . I will say that for the price ( which at this writing was $ 14 ) , they sound just ok with certain things ( like enhanced bass ) but mostly worse than the standard iPod\iPhone headphones . The bass is definitely cranked up regardless of whatever " equalizer " setting you choose on your iPod , iPad , MP3 device , etc . What makes them seem so sub-par is the very dissapointing high and mid range quality . No matter what the source I chose to listen to ( music , video , game , movie ) the bass was overpowering and everything else sounded canned , muffled , tinny and generally underwhelming . Comfort and build are decent , but nothing to increase my rating . I dont consider myself an audiophile by any means but even with a low price , I cannot recommend these for people who like a decent sound to their buds . My only point of comparison are the buds included with my iPad and a pair of more expensive Sennheiser CX-300 's which ( even though it 's an unfair comparison ) sound like they cost hundreds of times more than these buds .  
2	  Great for the price , haven't really put it to the test quite yet , but have used it a little and it seems to work very smoothly !  
2	  I used this device to connect a second monitor to my Apple G5 tower . I have two Dell monitors with DVI inputs connected . No software needed and connection is a snap . It will work with any DVI monitor but does not support USB or power to the monitor like the port does to Apple displays with ADC monitors . You can connect the Dell monitor USB ports to the apple ports in back of the tower if equiped with USB out ports .  
1	  The images seem good enough . The software , however , is SO SO anti-intuitive . Every little thing I want it to do requires 10 minutes of hunting through the program to find where the function is and how to apply it . I wish EPSON printers would make a comeback .  
1	  Dont even bother purchasing this . Documentation of the device setup and yahoo music engine is worse than none-existant . Lynksys tech support has always been excellent for all other products except this one . After nearly a month still can't get it to work even marginaly . Linksys WMB54G Wireless-G Music Bridge  
1	  ORIGINAL REVIEW : I purchased mine a few days ago with a Gateway 200 Centrino notebook . Set-up was a breeze with all my computers in my LAN . Nevertheless , my Centrino notebook kept on loosing connection . Tried several things and noticed there was a firmware update in the Netgear web site which fixes connectivity issues with Centrinos . Downloaded it , upgraded the router and it works well now . If it would of not presented this " issue " out of the box , I would of probably given it 5 stars . UPDATE : My Netgear router died after 3 days . There are just too many reviews with DOA . I think the manufacturer should do a much better job at screening infant mortality . I still gave it a couple of stars as the product design is OK and customer service was acceptable . SUGGESTION : I strongly recommend you stay away from Netgear until they get their act together and get the LINKSYS from CISCO.I purchased the LINKSYS B router . It is so much sturdier , physically and operational . Just as user friendly as the Netgear and already comes pre-certified for CENTRINO .  
1	  I was initially drawn to the My Book from Western Digital because of the size , price , and footprint . Unfortunately , I hadn't researched enough reviews from previous owners . After bringing the drive home , I plugged it into the computer and it loaded right up . I downloaded 6 or 7 gigs of important documents onto it , and went to bed . The next day it turned on once more , and then never again . After numerous e-mails to their tech department , I have yet to get a response . If the previous reviewer is right , ( and I 'm afraid he is ) , I 'll be lucky to get a replacement , and have no chance of getting my data back . With what I 've lost , it is the most expensive piece of computer equipment I 've ever bought .  
2	  My wife and I recently took a vacation and decided to rent a GPS unit with our car . Instantly hooked ! We saw far more of the city than we would have without it . Like the microwave or a VCR when they first came out .. this is one of those gadgets that will leave you wondering how you managed to survive without it ! So after doing my " homework " we decided to buy the Streetpilot C340 . As the other reviews have stated , it is very easy to use from the time you first turn it on . And unlike the C330 model ( which will say " Turn right in 300 feet " ) , the C340 will say " Turn right on Main Street " which is VERY useful when you can't afford to look away from the road . The biggest problem I have could be fixed easily by garmin .. map detail . Here are a few problems that I found . 1 . ) During the initial test of the unit , I looked up " Casinos . " It could not find the casino in my hometown that had been there for 10 + years ( nor one just 2 hours away that had been there for 6 years ) . It did however find several others that were either in major cities or had been there longer . 2 . ) In the neighboring town ( population 3500 ) , it listed 60 % of the streets as " county route # " rather than the actual street name . 3 . ) We tried to find a church for a wedding we were attending located outside the city limits on backroads . After browsing the map ( visually ) we found the street . However the unit could not find it via typing because after a few letters it tried to guess the street name . Normally this would be a very nice feature , but ( at times ) it isn't close . And , as I listed above , it may not even know the street name . I 'm not sure if this can be turned off yet or not . Most of these problems I wouldn't even know about had I not tested it in an area I was already familiar with . And this area has a low population . I just expected the maps to be more " up to date . " Overall I have no regrets . This unit does exactly what it should . It is extremely easy to use and has a lot of nice features . Pre-programmed points of interest such as : gas stations , hotels , food etc . It will tell you where they are ( starting with the closest ) , how many miles , and estimate the time you will arrive . And with one click on " Home " it will recalculate and direct you back to where you were staying . I would recommend this to anyone .. * LESS THAN ONE MONTH LATER * Not sure if I have a defective item or not . We decided to drive a few hours to a nearby major city to do some christmas shopping and have dinner . The unit did a good job getting us down there ( although half of the drive it tooks us on backroads rather than major highways ) . It found the area we were looking for with ease . However the restaurants were another story . The first restaurant we searched for wasn't even there ( I assume it went out of business ) . The second search should have only been 8 miles away , however it ended up sending us on a " wild goose chase " for about 15 miles , then it started to turn us around and head back the way we came . We did another search and found the restaurant to be less than a mile away . Another problem we found is that it doesn't seem to know the difference between left and right . About 50 % of the time it announced the exit to be on the wrong side of the road ( along with the last restaurant ) . I realize this is new technology , however I would have expected better from Garmin . .. Seriously considering returning the C340 !  
1	  Never received the item . Lost in shipping and was not able to re-order due to item being out of stock . I was charged for item and had to request credit for item that never shipped . Avoid this vendor !  
2	  Works well , a bit tricky to set-up and only works w / certain routers . Despite only 802.11b 11mbps speeds , video streams well .  
2	  it 's a little slow in focusing , but it 's lightest and most compact lens you can carry for the lens that reach this far . Near macro works good too . this lens and NikonD700 has good harmony i think .  
1	  My husband bought me this camera ten months ago as an early Christmas present . While the picture quality is not the greatest , I have found it to take decent photos for the price . It is easy to use , although , like all point-and-shoot cameras , it is at times difficult to get a clear picture due to unsteady hands . My major complaint about this camera is the cheap build . My husband accidentally dropped the camera from about five inches off the ground , where he caught it before it made full impact . Still , the camera will no longer turn on . When I contacted Kodak , I was told that it would cost $ 90 to repair , which is nearly what my husband paid for it in the first place . I am considering their service upgrade deal where you turn in a broken camera for a discounted new one , but after this one broke so easily , I am unsure that I want to spend the money on another Kodak just to have it break like the first one . While the camera takes decent pictures , it has shoddy workmanship and poor materials and can break upon even the smallest impact , and the cost to repair it is simply not worth it . Edit : My mother was able to wiggle some parts in the battery compartment to make it work again .  
2	  So far I am happy with Lexar 's Sport JumpDrive . I have the 256mb and the 64mb versions . Once you get the rubber cap off it works well ( many people knock the rubber cap but it is there for a reason ) .  
2	  You cannot go wrong with Sandisk memory . Where several other brands have failed , Sandisk works in my Ipaq . The price was right and the delivery was very quick . I will be ordering Sandisk in the future when I need more memory .  
2	  The TV was delivered just when promised . It was a great price and I checked extensively before ordering . I am very pleased with the process .  
2	  Just to clarify on what people have said , so that there 's no misunderstanding . There are 2 general types of reviews out there , one rating the product immediately upon receipt and one after burn-in . The sound difference is considerable . When I first tried out the SE530 , I kinda liked them . They were my first high end earbud , and I didn't know what to expect . The mids and highs were nearly crystal clear . The bass was very pronounced but lacked definition somewhat . Overall , it sounded very well . After some unknown amount of time , I was listening to these earbuds and I realized for the first time .. they sounded better than I remembered it did . The bass was especially punchy , defined , tight , and very engaging . The mids and highs remained ultra clear , but I do not remember whether it was an improvement over the previous sound . But they sure as heck sounded good . Bottomline , these buds require time to be burned in . Many reviews on here neglected the burn-in process and consequently gave some negative impressions .  
2	  The picture quality is great . I 'm not sure if it is designed that way but it makes a clunking sound when ejecting the disc .  
2	  i think that i 'm the first person ever in the world to review this player .. i looked everywhere for a review to see if i should buy this thing or not , but couldn't find any .. so i went for it anyways .. it 's a nice small player , and worth it for the price , there 's only one really big thing that you people might find small , but , there 's no clip or anything for when you run .. it 's like you made a leather case for the thing , can't you add a little clip ? it 's not that hard .. secondly , you have to go into the menu to access the volume and the hold function , which is weird .. and the headphones they give with it , are actually pretty nice .. pretty good sound .. it looks really nice too , i just really wish there was a clip man .. now i gotta hold it in my hand when i run , which sucks .. oh well ..  
2	  I bought this system Xmas 2001 . .. There a few " nagging items " I 'd of like done differently but overall I 'm very pleased . THE GOOD1 ) Sounds great ! The subwoofer & ( 5 ) satellite speakers are nice looking & compact . And the output is plenty for our 12 ' x 16 ' room . 2 ) Plays virtually ALL TYPES of CD 's perfectly . I use DVD , CD-audio , CD-R & CD-RW with MP3s . I 've encountered no skipping problems . 3 ) I plugged my existing CD changer & my HiFi VCR into it 's RCA jacks . These components were integrated well . 4 ) 5.1 Dolby Digital DVD output . 5 ) DVD playback features are adequate . Picture quality is perfect ( of course - it 's digital ) . THE BAD1 ) No DVD zoom or similar features I 've seen on other players . Not a real big deal to me .. 2 ) No built-in DTS decoder . Again not a big deal to me as Dolby digital kicks ! 3 ) It takes approx 5 sec to " read " a disc before any playback can begin . 4 ) There is no text display for MP3 files & the unit doesn't " chapter " folders the way some units I 've seen will . For instance if you have individual albums in separate folders , you can't " chapter " from folder-to-folder . This unit only skips tracks although you can type in a " go-to " track # . THE UGLY1 ) Very slow disc changes . I timed it at about 12 sec . Almost best to consider it a single disc player . 2 ) MP3 playback seems to be limited to a MAXIMUM of 160 kbps encoding rate . This is annoying to me as I have many recordings at 192 + kbps and this unit will jump / skip at high bit-rates . 3 ) The unit tends to get hot seemingly due to it 's " Energy Star " compliance that cycles the fan ON / OFF . I actually returned the 1st unit I 'd purchased thinking the fan wasn't working . After getting the 2nd one and watching the fan , I realized it cycles . Take heed and install in a ventilated area with good air flow !  
2	  The Zune is an excellent mp3 player and well worth the price . The interface is exceptionally easy to use and intuitive . The 3 inch screen is fantastic for viewing videos and photos . My boyfriend has the new 80g iPod , and we compared the two side by side . The 3 inch screen is really large compared to the iPod 's . Titles are easier to read and the interface is easier to maneuver around . The Zune also has an FM transmitter . In order to get the same capability in the iPod you have to buy a bulky attachment . As I have never owned an iPod I did not have the desire to try and use the interface button as a scroll wheel , which iPod owners may be disappointed with . Problem - I don't know anyone else with a Zune so I have not been able to try the wireless feature , which does not connect to my computer . I bought the Zune with the home pack ( charger , dock and remote ) . The home pack is well worth getting as you can just set the Zune in the dock and it charges . The remote is designed exactly like the Zune with the translucent black finish . Also , the Brown color is beautiful . The edges " glow " green and is very visually dynamic . The Zune does not deserve any of the negative press that it has gotten .  
1	  The Good : Great design . Even smaller than the really small I imagined both in size and weight . Clix interface works great . Five stars for design . The Bad : Battery life is more like 4-5 hours , even with energy-using options turned way down . Using any less energy than my settings would make the screen completely superfluous . Died after one month . Awaiting RMA return . One star for the all-critical ability to actually use it . Conclusion : Nifty design , poor reliability or too expensive depending on how you look at it . If these cost around $ 5.00 each you could stock up on , say , a dozen at a time , keep a few of them charged at all times , and give them the toss as they died .  
2	  We 've given this gift to several of our family members and it has been a HUGE hit . Our family is spread out all over , and many of them are not computer savvy . It has allowed my grandparents , who are thankfully still with us , to see their great-grandchild grow up on a daily basis even though they live very far away from us and are so afraid of new technology that they don't even have a VCR ( they got one as a gift once , but it was " too complicated " so they gave it back . They absolutely love the Ceiva . We are able to send out photos to all of these Ceivas and when our family members wake up in the morning , they are on display . Do I wish the service was cheaper ? Well sure , it is always nice to spend less money , but I think the service is worth the fee because of the amount of joy it has brought to the people we have given it to . It helps us feel very connected over the many miles . I 've had to contact customer service around 6 times on behalf of the various Ceivas we 've purchased . The first two times they were great and fast . Then they went through a period of being very slow . I think their sales outpaced their expectations and they weren't ready for customer service . The last two times I contacted them the response was reasonably fast , and they took care of the problem completely . As of the last time I spoke to them they were taking care of customer service in house still , which I am very glad of . I am so sick of companies who outsource .  
1	  You need plenty of light to use this camera to get even ok photos . I can't use this in half of my house because the photos come out to dark . the optinal flash gives everything a yellowish tint and takes forever to load . I use it to take pics of my toddler but by the time the pic is taken he has moved . its not very quick . I also noticed some sellers were selling it for $ 199 . That seems extreme to me the average price is $ 120 . I got it on sale for $ 80 and even that was to much . you can get a camera for around the same price with more megapixels save your money on this one  
1	  While I knew the flash drive I bought was a used one , it arrived containing the former owners data , some personal , and also had a missing part of its slide essential for inserting it into the computer UBS slot .  
2	  I purchased this tripod in early 2004 ( it 's now Nov . 2011 ) to use for holding my spotting scope while out birding . After 7 years , I 've finally decided to upgrade to another brand . Generally speaking , it was a decent tripod . However , don't get the leg clamps wet without drying them off .. they will rust ! It was usually stable , although it wasn't heavy enough to withstand strong winds when I had the center column all the way up . After ~ 5 1/2 years the clamps cracked ( presumably from repeated exposure to cold , wet conditions ) and the legs started to slide when they were " locked . " All in all , it was a good tripod for a long time !  
1	  There are a variety of folks on the net talking about the " delayed write failed " errors these drives get after a while . I had mine ( I have 3 ) work for almost a year on WinXP before they started crapping out . Now I 'm struggling just to get the data off them . And LaCie 's tech support is entirely not interested . " You should reformat , that 'll probably fix it . " Right . Like cutting off my head will cure my headache . I used to really think LaCie made good stuff .. their industrial design is certainly attractive . But their " Big Disk " products are crap , and their support is either abusively indifferent or just nonexistent . I 'm hoping I can get the data off the disks and they try to get some use out of them on the Mac , but even there the one disk I reformatted has had recognition problems .  
1	  I saw the reviews warning that this adapter doesn't hold the US plug very well , but more recent reviewers seemed to have positive experiences so I gave it a try . No dice . The adapter just doesn't hold the 2-prong plugs well . Unfortunately , it seems Amazon just doesn't stock quality adapters at this time .  
2	  I 've had my camera for serveral weeks now and I 'm generally happy with it . This is my first digital camera . Some of my learning has been trial and error . The owners guide could use some help . The camera is taking great pictures and is easy to use with the auto setting . I 'm slowly using some of the manual settings . The movie mode was important to me . I bought a 1GB memory stick . It gives me enough memory for family events with still shots and movies . The quality of the movie was important and I 'm happy to say we have nice movies from this camera . Indoors becomes very challenging because of lighting issues in the movie mode . I 'm not sure yet if I can make an adjustment or not . Outdoors the camera take great movies for a still camera . For the price and features I 'm very happy and would recommend this camera to any beginner .  
1	  Product was $ 2.50 , shipping was $ 7.50 . I have a 2004 4Runner w / CD / tape . This product works well for about 1 song and then quickly gets grainy , full of static and poor sound quality . For $ 10 I thought that I would gamble and hopefully come up a winner . Keep your $ . The thing is junk . I don't know why it works for a moment and then doesn't but it 's frustrating and fiddling with it while driving is just plain dangerous .  
2	  The only reason I couldn't give this product 5 stars is because it doesn't charge my iPod ( 3rd generation ) .. but the sound quality is awesome , it 's SO easy to use and when I wrote to the company to ask about the fact that it wasn't charging my iPod .. I got a very fast and personal reply . They helped me determine which iPod I have , explained to me in detail why it didn't work and offered to send me a model that will work for my iPod after I ship mine back . They have outstanding customer service ! And when I get the new poduct I will be sure to write a review for that one as well ! If you have anything other than a 3rd generation iPod - this is a great thing to own .. and while I didn't get to try it out .. it says you can use it with any audio device with a standard output jack .. AND you can charge your cell phone if it 's USB chargable ! BONUS ! :) I highly recommend this !  
1	  This radio has a number of great features , but the reliability definitely needs improvement . In less than a year , the display stopped functioning . The person for whom I purchased this radio then received another of this exact same model as a gift following the demise of the first . Now , within only 2 months the volume dial stopped working on the new radio ! There are a number of cheaper options that are much more durable , such as the Sony models . For the price , the cheap build quality is inexcusable .  
2	  I use mine for other pictures as well as i-zone pictures . If used correctly , it works pretty well . Plus I can upload it on my computer and send pictures via email and put on my homepage . It cost much less than a full-size scanner and is pretty flexible . Check out [ .. ] for all the uses .  
2	  Just received this pair or wireless speakers today and I 'm very impressed ! They are very easy to set up , the sound is excellent and they are nice and compact . I initially tried these speakers with my MP3 player and they sounded good . Then I hooked them up using the headphone jack on my receiver and they kicked it up a notch ! Really , with the stronger signal they are much fuller and fit the bill perfectly . I would definately buy these again !  
1	  I have had this printer for about 3 months now and have already had to buy a $ 175 drum and countless toner cartridges . And I don't print anywhere near the maximum output of 30,000 pages per month . I might do 2500 a month . Yes the printer is cheap and prints high quality , but it isn't worth all the extra costs associated with it . And it is very slow if any type of complex document is sent to the printer , VERY SLOW . To upgrade the memory from HP is $ 500 . If I had it to do over I would not have chosen this printer .  
1	  I have owned an HP 940c now for about a year , and as it 's now 4AM in the morning and I have a long project to work on , the printer has given me a hardware failure . Having said that I 've tried it on different computers , with different cartridges ( thought maybe the OS X driver was to blame but evidently not ) , and it 's dead . Now it 's 4AM and I 've spent 2 hours troubleshooting the printer only to have it dead . To top it off this printer uses the HP # 15 cartridge which is a # 45 cartridge with half the ink at the same price .. you cannot use a # 45 in this printer . I highly reccomend against buying this printer . Not only is it subject to the expensive ink cartridges but it has been widely known for paper feeder problems ( a school district recalled theirs ) , and they are all eventually prone to this sort of failure .  
2	  So this is by no means a new product , but 30gb is more than the vast majority of people need out of an mp3 player so it 's still a valid option and can be found at a good deal . I received my Zune as a gift for Christmas the very first year it was available . It still works great after all of these years .. even after being dropped on tile more than twice . Zune software was stressful in the beginning but they 've improved very much over the years to the point of there being no known problems . Again , yeah this isn't the new Zune and it 's pretty thick now days , but great deals can be found on this device , which can do almost everything that the new Zunes can . I 'd recommend the new Zunes first , but if you 're looking for a good deal on an mp3 player and don't care how new it is , definitely go for this .  
2	  This is an excellent unit at a good price .. I wish there was more bass in the sound but other wise the unit is flawless and I live in NYC and priced this unit and it was $ 1049 at one of our big retailers .  
1	  I bought 3 of these for my IPOD Shuffle . It was advertized that it would work . Not even close . None of them work . A waste of my $ AND time !  
1	  none of them fit in any of my ethernet ports ! , they are very tight and won't clip no matter how hard I push .  
1	  When I bought this item , I had great expectations that it would upgrade my listening options immensely by being able to use my iPod in the car . Using a pre-set radio frequency on the in-dash radio , the Irock plugs into the iPod so that music can be played through the car 's speakers . The results for me , however , were mixed at best . On the good side , it was great to be able to access all of my music at my fingertips when all of my pre-set stations were playing commercials . On the flip side , the quality of the transmission from the irock to the iPod was not only lacking in listening quality punch , but was also intermittent and would fade in and out enough to make the experience unpleasurable . In the end , I decided to upgrade my stereo and get an Auxiliary Out feature , which while much more expensive , the quality is as though you had used the Aux Out feature on your home stereo and there is no degradation of sound . If your budget dictates that you would have no other option , the Irock is a good solution if your expectations are scaled back . Note : if you buy this product and leave it in the car , make sure not to place anything of any weight over it as the power button is very sensitive and your battery will drain down .  
1	  I rate products on how they perform their advertised functions . The E performs its advertised functions but with 2 glaring flaws that make it a dud . First , the battery is of low quality . I had to take my first one back because it did not want to hold a charge after only a week . I later found out that this is a common problem . Considering you only have a 90 day warranty I would say buyer beware . Second , the screen will often crack for no apparent reason other than stress from the unit being assembled wrong at the factory . After 60 days my screen cracked for no apparent reason . It was sitting on my desk in perfect shape one moment and the screen was cracked the next . Not even the short 90 day warranty covers the screen and Palm will charge you $ 100 to replace the screen . If you insist on buying the E then go ahead and get ripped off further and buy the extended warranty .. you will need it .  
1	  Attempted multiple times to install , eventually evein the same room . Each time , at the receiving telephone instrument all you heard was a beep and some loud static , then nothing . I ended up ordering a hard-wired jack from the telephone company . The only redeeming quality is the customer service from the seller was exceptional . They refunded with no question .  
1	  I purchased this cable based on positive reviews from others who had bought it here . Unfortunately , my experience with the cable was unsatisfactory . I bought the cable to connect an Xbox to a Samsung LCD TV which has two component inputs . I tried the cable on both inputs , and in all three modes ( 480p , 720p , 1080i ) . In all cases , I saw severe ghosting . I ended up purchasing a different cable from an auction seller , and it worked flawlessly - therefore I feel confident in saying that the cable I received was defective . Very disappointing , I was looking forward to being able to use the digital audio output connection too .  
2	  I purchased a [ $ ] " Etherengine " card from a different vendor and had nothing but headaches . After spending hours and hours re-installing sofware and downloading patches for Windows 98SE , I finally gave up and bought the Microsoft card . Within 20 minutes I was up and running ! The software is fool-proof and the manual is easy to understand . This card is worth it 's money .  
2	  This 45 degree erecting prism is great for birding or terrestrial viewing but is not suitable for star gazing ( imagine if the star is right above your head ) . For star gazing the prism does not reflect as much light as desired so you won't be able to see dim distant objects easily , for that I recommend star diagonal with everbrite mirror ( from televue ) , it will cost more but a good investment for anyone who is serious about star gazing .  
1	  If you try to use a Microsoft Force Feedback joystick then forget about this simple cable with 2 connectors . I called Belkin and they assured me I will not have problem with my Microsoft Force Feedback . As usual today , they lied . I ordered from XP PASSPORT for about 3 dollars plus more than 8 dollars shipping and handling ( one man or woman handling from the shelf to the envelope ) . Now checking their return policy they refund the merchandise but not the shipping costs . As you reckon I am not going to pay a shipping to get 3 dollars back , even I doubt they give the money back . XP PASSPORT took a super long time to ship . So Belkin and XP PASSPORT belong to the same society . Shame on Belkin and shame on XP PASSPORT.I think Amazon should check close this guys .  
1	  are there 2 different mac edition diNovo edge keyboards by Logitech ? amazon has 2 listed for very different prices but i think there is just one so be sure you click the cheaper link if you still are inclined to purchase after reading my review .. I had the original dinovo windows edition for nearly 2 years running with my mac mini home setup . I really loved the design / looks and the concept of a mouse keyboard combo for a home theater setup . So sold my old version on amazon ( got a decent price ) and bought the mac edition .. Now the bad news .. the mac edition is a little worse which pushes it into the DON'T RECOMMEND category . why worse you asked ? Well it boils down to one feature - they made the left and right click buttons slightly smaller and rounded the edges . using the pc version was a little laborious but now with smaller click buttons , it 's unusable . Clicking and dragging and dropping a file or a moving a window is near impossible and bloody frustrating . my cool home theater tool became a thorn in my side all because i traded in for the mac edition just to have a front row button instead of a windows home ! I hope apple is listening and will improve on logitech 's original concept - logitech has obviously lost the plot ! if anyone wants to trade the windows version for my mac edition - get in touch , i still have the box  
1	  The sound from the unit is descent given the size and construction . The wireless system , however is pretty bad . In an urban area you might be able to get 20 ' , but even then you 'll get periodic interference . In a more rural setting it becomes moderately usable , with more like 40 ' and fewer blasts of junk .  
2	  Maybe I 'm a printer-holic : I have an Epson Photo R200 for photos . I have a Primera Signature Z6 for CDs ( fantastic printer , by the way ) . But I needed a fast , reliable printer for handouts and training materials . I work in Illustrator and InDesign , and PostScript Level 3 was critical . This printer is genuine Adobe PostScript ( not " PretendScript " like other printers ) , and it shows . But , beyond that , the entire experience is superior : the manufacturing standards are splendid ( great fit and finish ! ) , and the set-up guide is perfect-you can't go wrong . The little ink sticks are shape-coated so that even a trained squirrel could load them . The " walk-up installation " that finds Windows boxes and says " hello " automatically is wonderful . It 's speedy , sharp and chock full of great features I didn't know I 'd love . I highly recommend this printer !  
2	  This is a good product as there is not an alternative product that I was able to find on Amazon . Does just what it say 's the Blue Tooth quality is good and also being able to use a 3.5mm jack is a nice bonus . Also the USB jack is nice so you can charge your phone with the product as well , you can charge your phone and listen to music at the same time however there is a slight buzzing noise that occurs that can be quite annoying . I use with a Galaxy S II and have used with an S II and a HTC G1 , all supported . The microphone quality for making phone calls in average at best , has the tin can effect that a lot of blue tooth products have . The biggest flaw of this product is how tight if fits into the cigarette lighter of a car . You have to be careful when pulling it out as they are in so tight the can break easily if not pulled out smoothly . This has happened several times however Satechi customer service is good and has replaced the broken units . Overall good would not buy it for making or answering phone calls , more for integrating with an older cars stereo system .  
2	  this splitter works great and do think you will like it and if you need more than one order more than one at the price  
2	  I have a HP Compaq TC4400 . This is the pen for it . Compared to the one I got with the tablet PC this one is designed to be harder to break , which is a good thing . My previous one broke when I accidentally dropped it on hard ground .  
1	  My Windows Laptop has burned every kind of DIsk - and generally works great . Except with Verbatim . To date , I 'm getting it to accept / acknowledge about 1 in every 5 disks I try to burn . Save your money and get something else .  
2	  The installation was made so simple . Simply position the draw tabs facing outward , toward the hole perimeter and twist screws down tight . The speaker doesn't require any extra bracketing or supports to deal with .  
2	  Perfect for the person who needs 2 batteries charged . Only thing i see that some may not like is the batteries charge one at a time . But if you just want the luxury of not having to worry about changing batteries after one is charged , this is what you want .  
2	  I have tried several humidifiers for my son 's room ( Hunter , Vicks filterless , Kaz , etc . ) and this is the only one I have found that has a great quiet setting . There are times when the bubbles will gurgle to fill the water , but it is rare and my son got use to it easily . The filter will yellow quickly if you don't use one of the Kaz humidifier water cleaning products ( they are very inexpensive and are worth it , especially if you have hard water ) . We use the humidifier every night and every nap and it works very well . I am going to buy a second one for my bedroom .  
1	  I bought this camera as a rush purchase to go on a weeked trip . Due the fact that my Kodak T550 was left at home . I know Aps cameras my not produce the greastest images blown up but I like them . I used my head and while I was there I took a test roll and got them developed at a local store in an hour . I was already uneasy with the half-way decent quality of the pictures then and by the time I went through 7 rolls of film I was really on edge . I got back home and over 60 % of my pictures came out dull , underexposed , and just awful . So I took my negative to an additional two other film proccessors and some of my pictures came out better but not by much . I 've only been taking pictures for 5 years and I don't claim to know it all , but I really have come to dislike this camera . The only ' strenghs ' to the camera are its looks and the LCD glow-type button function . While it wasn't acting like a camera with astigmatism ( which I have ) the pictures came out great .  
1	  I have only had my Zen for about 5 months and it 's already freezing up . I have to keep resetting it but to no avail . I think I should have paid exrta money and went with iPod .  
2	  Easy to install , not the loudest set of speakers , but they rock if you are close to them . I would suggest getting these if you need something that is a little better than 2.1 speakers or your headphones . Also , if you are looking for something to accommodate your movie watching on your computer this will work great . If you want to have your rear speakers far away I would get extensions for them . Have fun and enjoy a great cheap set of speakers .  
1	  I thought this would be a great gift and bought 4 of them . Unit worked well until I tried installing the software and it crashed with an error from Macromedia Projector . Tried installing it on a second computer and got the same exact error . I went online for support or updated drivers and found nothing useful on their site . Too bad for Flip - I am taking all of them back .  
2	  Very happy with this purchase . The screen pulls down in front of a TV when we 're ready to watch something projected on the big screen . We can even leave the TV on behind it if we want because the black backing blocks the light from the TV . It 's easy to pull & reliably recoils every time when it 's time to put it away . You will also need to purchase wall / ceiling-mount brackets to mount it with .  
2	  a little daunting at first , but easy to use , very accurate and so far long battery life . would definitely recommend it .  
2	  What can be said ? I purchased the colored sleeves because of the price . However , it does give one the ability to segregate the different CD 's by category .  
2	  Well , I have used this product with more than 100 t-shirt and I have no complains . After my 3 first big trials .. a really mess .. It is easy to transfer ( once you get used with the process ) , it is a fast process , and the image stay for a long time on the fabric . Of course , the transfer will not last forever , but after 100 + washing cycles , all of my t-shirt still are in PERFECT condition . I use soft soap , and a soft washing machine cycle . The most important words here , are : VERY high temp iron ( mine is one with 1400 watts ) , very VERY high pressure when ironing ( I sweat a lot in this process ) and the fabric must be as flat and firm as possible ( porous fabrics are not the best , as well as stretching ones like cotton-lycra are not a good option because when stretching , the image breaks ) . One last note : it is for white fabric . If you try it over other color , the image 's colors will be different from intended . If the fabic is dark colored , you will not see anything after trasferring . This is because the WHITE color of the image after ironing comes from the fabric , so if within the image are white and shiny teeth , and the fabric is dark , the teeth will be black , as well as all the other light colors of the images .  
1	  I purchased a new PC in 12/11 with Windows 7 Pro 64 bit and realized to late that I did not order enough USB ports for all of my peripherals . I installed this card and it seemed to be okay . However , when I powered down I got a blue screen . I had to pull the plug to turn off the machine . I removed the card and restarted the PC then powered down normally and on again . My PC is healthy - just did not like this card . I have no way to tell if the card was in some way defective - but since it did see two USB devices , I believe there was no problem in that respect . Windows 7 64 bit just did like the card . I am still searching for one that will work with the installed operating system .  
2	  I originally purchased a different JVC model , not knowing that it had DVD capability . When I learned that it did and set it up to a TV , I was very pleased with all this system offered - 5 disc changer , aux input , video out , great sound , MP3 capability , etc . Unfortunately my original system suffered some sort of internal error after 2 years , and I was unable to get a resolution through tech support . I was unimpressed with the support I got , which lead to a referral to a service center , but when I called them , I ended up in telephone system limbo .. After being without my system for some time , I missed it enough that I went in search of a system with similar capabilities , but I was unable to find many options that handled not only audio , but also video within the price range . So I sucked it up and purchased a new model , very similar to my original model . I 'm still hoping to get the old one fixed and then have two , but in the meantime although I 'm bitter with my support issue , I 'm glad to have a working system back in place . I don't know why other manufacturers aren't successful in developing models with similar capabilities ( again , the DVD being a major difference ) . I guess not many people make use of the DVD feature ..  
2	  My husband and I bought this TV a little over 5 months ago and it fantastic . The picture is crisp and clean . No dead pixels . No glare problems . Easy to hang on the wall with a standard wall mount . We didn't expect anything from the Ambilight feature , but I must admit it makes watching TV easier on your eyes . It can be turned off if you do not like it . There are plenty of inputs for your gaming systems , etc . PS3 games and Blu-ray both look outstanding .  
2	  I use these at work for many hours at time for music and podcasts . Pros : - Good believable soundstage . The music sounds more like it is surrounding you rather than coming from between your ears . - Overall very pleasant , non-fatiguing sound . - Very neutral sounding headphones from the midrange up . - Lightweight and very comfortable for long usage . Very little pressure against the head , and easy on the ears . - Efficient . Very easy to drive with a portable player . No need for headphone amp . - Super long cordCons : - Weak bass . Not good for R & B ; / Rap music unless you don't mind EQing or bass boosting to get the desired sound . - Very plasticky construction , though it is to be expected at this price point Non foldable Due to the lightweight and all-plastic construction , you can easily hear vibrations if anything is rubbing against the headphones or cord . - Cord coming from both sides of the headphones instead of only on the one side . - The light pressure of the headphones and cheap foam padding doesn't allow for good sound isolation . At moderate music volume , you can still make out what the person next to you is saying . - Super long cord may not be ideal for portable usage . Overall , a great set of cans and in terms of sound quality , I would put it up against anything $ 50 and under . The majority of the " Cons " above are expected for cans that cost this much . My only real disappoint is the lack of the bass , which is the main reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 .  
1	  I am not an audiophile , nor a particularly tough critic for things like headphones where most products are " good enough " for my rare usage . These headphones , however , are not comfortable around the ears in my opinion . It also pulls a hair or two out of my head just about every time I take them off ( I have short hair ) . Sound quality seems fine to me , but again , I 'm not qualified to really speak to it in detail . The cord is sufficiently long which is nice .  
2	  I really enjoy my zune . Thank you very much for having the product at a very affordable price .  
2	  $U$ keep the price under $ 300 Apple deleted the AC adaptor that was included with previous iPODS . You only get the USB charging cable . Remember too that not all USB ports have power on some computers . So if you ever want to travel or don't want to keep your iPOD charging on your desk all day or in an internet cafe , you need the AC adaptor that just plugs into the wall to charge . There may be ones that work that aren't apple brand I 'm not sure .. but you need one , trust me .  
2	  I have just begun using an SLR camera . This was the right choice . It is simple to handle and does not have any confusing features . And best of all , it doesnt break . All around i think this camera was a good buy .  
2	  Everything worked great for what I needed it for . The video is a little bit darker but that 's just cause I need to do some adjusting on my part . Very good and I would recommend to others !  
2	  I am very happy with the product and with the way I receive it .  
2	  I can see the picture , slightly better than using the composite connection .  
1	  It simply did not work . I tested it against a shorter cable ( the one I was trying to replace with this one ) , and the shorter cable worked . This one did not . Buy a cable with a company name on it , like Belkin etc . They 're more likely to be QA 'd properly , at least since the company 's brand would suffer if they failed to work . I would exchange this cable , but the equipment setup it was originally supposed to be used with was delayed in its implementation by several months . My seller has a 30-day return / exchange policy . Lesson : Verify functional integrity of all purchases upon receipt , even if they won't be used immediately . One final note : This product has much thinner contact strips on the interior of its B-plug ( the one that goes into the printer ) than the same strips on the interior of my working cable 's B-plug . Bad manufacturing ? You decide .  
1	  This is the " if it ain't broke don't fix it .. " the title says it all .. my second Delorme the one they fixed was great .. too bad you guys don't have your own little consumers guide .. all life is going to Vegas .. but sometimes it pains when you not only lose but are left with SH .. C Corcoran  
1	  I feel I was mislead BIG TIME . Picture shows a box of TEN but say 's only one disk hidden under technical details . Verbatim disk are very good disk but if you want MORE than just ONE don , t buy this ONE . Not worth sending back so I feel I was ripped off .  
2	  SanDisk SDSDB-4096-A11 4GB SDHC Memory Card ( Blue ) Always a great choice and a terrific price on Amazon . com  
1	  Despite the many reviews stating the poor quality of the product I thought I 'd give it a go based on the few reviews in its favor . I should have listened .. and you should too . The converter is worthless , but if you 're wanting to spend a bit more just for the adaptors go for it , but I 'd look elsewhere . After merely turning on the electrical device the converted popped , smoked and was no longer effective .. or rather , was NEVER affective .  
2	  I used this earlier version of the sony " Psyc " walkman a LOT while it was still working . It lasted nearly a year with no problems . Then my dog jumped up at me unexpectedly and got her claws caught in the wires . The walkman smashed down onto the floor . The buttons on the player itself stopped responding . Fortunately I could still use the so-called " Remote control " . But then I snagged the wire on a doorknob and destroyed that as well . I think I would pay extra to have a wireless version of this product .  
1	  This doesn't really work that great . The armband sucks . I honestly would spend the 10 dollars more and get the nike brand one . I think this prodcut honestly is a piece of junk .  
2	  Simple item that just does the job it is supposed to . Nothing more , nothing less !  
1	  The only good thing about these earphones are the actual buds that go into your ear . They are comfortable . On the other hand , I don't see how the wraps fit anyone 's ears . I have pretty big ears and they are still quite loose on me . The sound is very poor . If you like earphones that lack bass , then these are for you . My iPod earphones blow these things out of the water . This is my first review . I usually don't like wasting my time writing reviews , but I just couldn't resist on this one .  
1	  Keys started failing after about 2 months , and some of the key markings rubbed off too . Not recommended .  
2	  Popped the top off with a screwdriver and put the SSCat sensor head on . Works just like the original canister but 3x bigger and costs less . Also , the lack of bitterant means that it won't funkify my kitchen every time it goes off .  
2	  I Love this unit . It is so simple to use and so incredibly small . I throw on my yoga pants and just go silly . I highly recommend this product  
2	  I had one of these where I worked and it 's now great to have one for play . I love the size of the body and the quality of the images . I recommend this to any amateur looking to step it up .  
1	  This is the perfect DVD duplication solution if you 're a loner with no children , pets or other responsibilities beyond caring for your DVD duplicator . If you enjoy rebooting , driver conflicts , and troubleshooting inkjet printers , then look no further .. you 'll be in heaven . If you use this printer exactly as suggested , on a standalone machine , with Primera 's own ink ( which will cost you . 35 to . 70 cents per disc you print ) , and you use it regularly , then you 'll be fine . Otherwise , you will spend a lot of time babying it . As a burner it 's quite good , especially at rejecting discs that other burners would pass ( but won't play for the client ) . If you want to burn and print elsewhere , you 'll be very happy . As a printer , it 's expensive and finicky . Every run requires significant testing . Take the time to do single disc print tests until you get everything just right . Then don't change anything . Run your job and all will be well . Printing results are good if you spend the time to test , calibrate , etc . Expect to spend at least an hour on print testing . Once things are set up , it is fire and forget , it 's just the amount of time it takes to get there . The biggest problem is that I haven't found a competing product that does a better job , yet . But I 'll keep looking and update this if I find one .  
1	  Well one would think Samsung is a trusted name , but when it comes to LCD TV .. one wonders . I bought this TV brand new from Amazon on January 10th 2007 . I was very amazed since it was my first LCD TV . At first it worked very nicely , although I had some problems searching for signals for the DVD and the VCR . After two months owning this TV the picture went black , only sound and no picture . I called SAMSUNG and took it to repair . After 2 months , they told me that the LCD PANEL was burned and the PCB main was not working . I live in Caracas , Venezuela and since I bought it in the USA , the warranty is useless . I just lost the money invested . Thanks SAMNSUN  
2	  I purchased this product based on a recommendation in Consumer Reports magazine . It was in fact simple to install on my small home network and easy to configure and use . It has rudimentary security - better than none , but not very reassuring at times . Still , I am not sure if I could handle a product that had a complicated security scheme . This works for me : it is easy to install , fast , enabled me to put many files shared by our home computers in one location thus freeing space on our personal notebook / laptop computers . I would buy another .  
1	  I tracked down a number of problems on my computer to this hub . I had an external hard drive connected through it , and the link kept on disconnecting when transfering large files . Most recently , this hub was causing continuous input mimicking an enter key input on my laptop . In the middle of working on something , the computer would go crazy like I was holding down the enter key . Even restarting the computer wouldn't fix it . I finally figured it out by systematically removing everything and restarting the computer , then plugging things in one at a time . Sure enough , with this hub in , the computer would go crazy . It almost did serious damage to some of my work ( imagine how you prevent work from being saved , but still close and restart your computer with a continuous ' enter key ' input ) . Now I am very leary of trying Targus brand hubs again .  
2	  Appothecary Style CD Storage Cabinet , WalnutWe have too much media and not enough organization . This unit addresses our needs . The 325 capacity unit is comprised of the 4 and 5 drawer unit plus the two shelf unit . They stack and are shipped in two separate boxes . They are secured ( and I use that word loosely ) with two small metal clips that you screw to the back to attach the two . Once attached , a lift and tilt could upset your setup . Some sites list this as being made of oak . It is not . It is solid wood ( probably birch ) , and is made in China . The finish is very attractive with a rustic look . The finish is not entirely even , so this piece isn't " too perfect . " It fits our casual lifestyle well . The legs give the unit a less bulky feel and are a nice touch . The drawers slide in and out easily , and are interchangeable . The walnut finish is lighter and has more red in it than I would have imagined based on my knowledge of a walnut stain as well as the photos and images found on the web . It is easy to assemble with a screwdriver and a fair amount of muscle . You might want to get some tap in feet protectors , as the bare wood legs are in direct contact with the floor . The item is well packed , and it needs to be , given the long haul from China to CA and then to IA via UPS ground . The packaging is sturdy with a double thickness cardboard and strategically placed fitted Styrofoam . If not for both of those features , this item would not have made the transit safely , as the box was crushed , dented and torn in multiple places . This is a good free-standing storage solution for CDs , DVDs and even VHS tapes . It blends well with most furnishings and its relatively small footprint makes this a good solution for our media storage . Reasons I did not give 5 stars : Finish color , fragility of top-to-bottom attachment , lack of floor protectors .  
2	  Very easy installation . Could have been four stars for the power button not working reliably and the drive was becoming mysteriously unavailable in it 's first weeks of use . Not an issue any more .. may very well have been malicious content on my drive that has since been ushered out . All is working now . All photos videos music and lesser used files run from it , what a relief to clear up all that space !
