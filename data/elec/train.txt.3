1	  I read the reviews and bought one anyway , which was my mistake . It was brand new and like the review said the volume cut out completely at low settings . Never mind the possibility of the batteries leaking the sound from this unit is way too bright ; meaning it has far too much treble . The button functions also do not make sense . Buy a Logitech Pure-Fi Anywhere ( I did ) or an Altec Lansing IM9 .  
2	  It 's alarming that old analogue video technology is so rapidly going the way of the Dodo ! SO many people , especially the elderly , are STUCK with this old technology , modern camcorders being far too complicated for them . My parents are in their mid-late 80 's and they 're not about to change their spots NOW . Yet they still LOVE to take video footage on their frequent holidays and delight in replaying all their old tapes endlessly when they 're home . NOW they want to record their Memoirs , but can't find VHS-C tapes in ANY regular shops .. Indeed , non whatsoever in New Zealand ! Nor could I get tapes delivered there , directly , so had to source them myself , in the States , via Amazon .. who came up trumps . My parents ' are happy , so I am happy . But I DO wish there had been more of a choice .. they had to settle for a huge number of 30-minute tapes rather than a much more manageable quantity of 90-minute ones . I dare say I am going to have to buy a 5-year supply pretty soon .. just in case they disappear COMPLETELY !  
1	  This thing is a piece of garbage . I had one sitting in a drawer that I quit using a while back ( replace with something better ) . I pulled it out the other day for a different application , and now I remember why it was in the drawer . The thing BARELY works , it locks up , linksys ' support is a joke , their latest firmware still doesn't help . You 'd think in 3 years they could fix the bugs .. the problem is they don't care .. It 's now in the garbage , as the cheap flimsy case isn't even useful as a door stop ..  
1	  Despite that Altec Lansing promotes that the IM9 is compatible with iPod Nano ; be advised that it does NOT fit the 2nd generation Nano model ( with the aluminum case ) . This misleading information left me wishing I could have given the product a zero rating because the omission made the product unfit for it 's intended and advertised purpose for me . It might be a great product but I was unable to judge it 's performance because I don't own an iPod the IM9 would accommodate . If like me , you have a 2nd gen . Nano , you 're out of luck . I 'm surprised to find only one review that mentions this incompatibility . I returned the IM9 to Amazon for credit .  
2	  The item performs like any other USB 2.0 , but I wished I had realized it was 10 long . Bulky , but works great otherwise .  
2	  This is by far the most convenient CD / DVD storage system I have ever owned . The stacking feature is a great spacer , and the removable sleeves work great for travel . A simple pop is all it takes to transfer them to the carrying case . Even when full , the design allows users to sort through their collection with the titles easily viewable . The dividers provide a great way to organize the discs ; however , if the writing on the labels is not kept to the outside , it can be slightly difficult to read . The organizer is sturdy and well-built , and the cover easily locks into place to protect the contents . A great buy ! I highly recommend !  
1	  Impressive picture quality in HD . Not so hot for non-HD signals - my 15 yr old sony crt looks better . Also , it 's slow to switch between signal inputs . Minor gripes , I 'd still probably give it 4 stars , except for the quality issues below . First we had the same buzzing power supply that everyone else had . Now , it has completely died . I 've had it 1yr and 2wks . When you turn it on , the screen flashes for a moment and goes black . Samsung says they should be able to extend the warrenty for 1 month to get it repaired . Hoping a tech can come by soon .. I was planning on this tv lasting 10yrs ! At this rate , it won't make it 2 .. and i doubt my next tv will be a samsung ..  
1	  I bought this for my D40X a few weeks ago , and I have to say I 'm not impressed . The rubber is very restrictive , and doesn't really do anything but keep it from getting scratched . If you still drop the camera from eye-level the rubber " armor " will only keep all of the broken pieces of your SLR close together when it smacks into the floor , and by no means save your lens or camera from damage .  
2	  After five minutes , I was up and running on AT & T ; Broadband formerly MediaOne 's RoadRunner service ( i.e. mediaone . net ) . Like prior reviews have stated , this modem is 3Com 's 3CR29210 . Throughout the documentation , you are told to use the settings for the 3Com 3CR29220 . This modem offers simple setup and excellent performance . I was leasing a 3Com 3CR29220 from AT & T ; and ( .. ) this modem makes financial sense if you plan to use the service for a year or more . It is too bad 3Com couldn't stay in the retail cable modem business and continue to offer inexpensive modems .  
2	  I just bought one of the white 30g IPOD Videos . I had the silver mini 4gb , and decided to upgrade . Loved the mini , but hated the fact I filled it with music and then whenever I wanted to add more songs , had to figure out what to keep or remove . Anyways , Im wondering if any owners of the new 5G ipod have found a good reliable and protective case for the new IPOD yet ? I 've read alot of reviews detailing the " Scratch factor " of the screen .. also read one tip from someone who says they are using a Sony PSP screen protector , apparently it covers the entire face for the IPOD 5G ? Any suggestions ? ( I figure its good to find a solution to the scratch problem instead of buying one and griping about it , its all about taking care of the " toy " )  
2	  Given that this is my first scanner , some of my enthusiasm for its features and ease-of-use might simply be naivete . On the other hand , having a fairly deep technical background , I think my appreciation of this unit 's abilities and organization are mostly based on Uniden 's exceptional design . Over and over I find that this unit operates just as I 'd like it to , showing that it 's the clear result of several generations of refined scanner design . The BC-780XLT provides both traditional frequency scanning , as well as trunk-tracking . Traditional scanning lets you program frequencies into memory banks , and then scan through them looking for active signals . You can also search ranges by programming the low and high endpoints , and having the scanner search between them for active frequencies . With 10 banks of 50 frequencies each , the BC-780XLT provides reasonable room for even the most crowded airwaves . ( And , as discussed further below , the ability to upload and download the scanner from a computer extends this ability significantly . ) Individual banks can be turned on and off , and individual channels can be explicitly locked out , allowing you to finely tailor your scan . Where this unit differs from traditional scanners is in its ability to track trunked systems . In such systems a small set of frequencies is shared by many different organizations ( e.g. , police , fire , public works ) , and rather than assigning fixed frequencies to specific units , the frequencies are assigned dynamically as needed . The result is that a single conversation may hop between frequencies as it progresses . Tracking this with a traditional scanner is nearly impossible , as a single frequency will play host to parts of different conversations , and a single conversation is strewn across multiple frequencies . The trunk-tracking scanner is able to use the information on the system 's control channel to follow the conversation , just like the radios of the participants . The result is that you follow a single conversation , rather than just a single frequency . Uniden offers several models of trunk-tracking scanner , including the lower-priced 895 , and the handheld 245 . The 895 is limited to tracking either trunked systems or traditional frequencies at any one time . The 780 ( and 245 ) , on the other hand , can intermingle trunk and regular frequencies within a single memory bank , and be set to scan through both of them , or between banks which contain any combination of trunked and standard frequencies . For me , where the 780 really excels is in its alphanumeric display . In addition to having an alpha tag for each channel , you are able to set up scan lists of talk group IDs . Talk group IDs represent a logical channel ( rather than a single frequency ) , such as the police department 's dispatch channels ( " Dispatch 1 " " Dispatch 2 " ) . When following a trunked system , the scanner tracks talk groups , rather than individual frequencies , and the labeling will show you an alpha tag for the talk group ( e.g. , " Tactical 1 " ) , rather than just he Motorola or EDACS ID number . This makes it much easier to know who you 're listening to . Public trunked systems are well documented ( either on the Web , or in publications such as " Police Call " ) , but for those that simply appear out of thin air ( you might stumble on a system 's control channel while searching frequency ranges , for example ) , the 780 will also help you find the full set of frequencies . Once you have found the control channel in a Motorola system , you can use a " control channel only " mode to ferret out the rest of the system 's frequencies . The 780 has a serial port through which the unit can be programmed or driven by computer . There are numerous software packages for accomplishing this , available through the many on-line 780 discussion groups and websites . It 's a good thing , too , as 500 channels , plus 10 trunk scan lists of 100 group IDs each ( 1000 total ) would be nearly impossible to program through the scanner 's front console . By keeping separate frequency files on your computer , you can easily download different sets of parameters ( i.e. , should you have more than 500 frequencies you want to keep track of ) . The front console and menu system are reasonably easy to understand , given the complex function available in this receiver . A novice user can get up and running with traditional frequency scanning very quickly , and the unit come with introductory frequency guides . Getting a trunked system programmed is a bit more work , but still not too complicated . The manual has most of the operational detail you 'll need , though it 's not always well organized as a reference ( e.g. , items mentioned in passing in one section may not be repeated elsewhere where you might go looking for it ) . The manual also contains a few mistakes . The numerous on-line discussion groups can help out if you get stuck . The reception with the included whip antenna is excellent in dense , urban areas . Where stations are weaker , obviously , an external antenna will be needed . The sound quality out of the bottom firing speaker is very listenable , though an external speaker ( for which a connection is included ) would improve the audio quality . The unit comes with both a wall-wart 120v adapter , as well as power cords for connection to a car battery and a car 's cigarette lighter . Reports of mobile usage have been very positive . Overall this has been a great purchase . I picked the 780 over the 895 primarily for the 780 's sophisticated alpha tagging system , and secondarily for its ability to track trunked and non-trunked systems at the same time . Both features have turned out to be essential to my enjoyment . Hopefully Uniden will get all of these features into a handheld unit !  
2	  This little mouse took some getting used to , but now I like it better than the standard size . And you can't beat the price .  
1	  It didn't take long to determine the ineffectiveness of this antenna for my uses , and it was returned pronto . It may be that my Boston Acoustics Receptor and my Bose Wave radios have such good internal and included antennas that they just made this antenna look bad , but I have lots better results without this item . True , it didn't cost much , but it did less . Perhaps it would make some difference with a lesser radio , but both my radios are better off using their own . I rate this a no no if you have a good radio .  
1	  I will never buy a Linksys product again . After Cisco bought it out the quality has been bad . Had to return 2 times to get a working unit . Even then it was pretty bad . I replaced the Linksys firmware with DD-WRT . Only then would it work . Even with the DD-WRT firmware the Wireless N wouldn't work . So I had been using all my N devices as G. Used it for 5 years and it finally died . I was copying large video files over the gigabit LAN and the hardware couldn't handle it . I now have an ASUS RT-16N it works perfectly . I had to upgrade the firmware on the ASUS to the latest . Wireless N works great with the ASUS .  
1	  I bought this filter for my newly bought 70-200mm recently . I 'm currently on a trip in San Francisco where I dropped my bag . Thankfully I swapped this cheap baby to my 24-70mm with my B + W Filter ( which is 70 bucks apx ) . This filter failed to protect my lens . The front element cracked , and now the filter is stuck to my 1500 dollar lens . Great ..  
1	  The Adesso tablet requirements say Mac OSX but the one I just bought for my daughter only works with a FOUR YEAR OLD operating system - OS9 . The fine print in the manual ( after you bought the thing ) says check the site for new driver info . When you go to the site it tells you FILE NOT FOUND . Beware this SCAM !  
1	  This remote sender unit is not the same as the RCA unit that is picturedin the sales ad . Don't expect to get a remote extender that looks orperforms like the RCA D-940 pyramid . They are not the same . The audiovoxmodel is fair , but not as good as the RCA D-940 .  
2	  Just recieved this today . I tried Bose , Audio technica , Sennheiser 's noise calling head phones . Among those I liked Bose and Senheiser . but I was not 100 % satisfied with the products . Then my office mate intorudced me this . I simpply love it ! I feel like this block 90 % of noise , cheaper , lighter and smaller ! Sounds are pure and clean . Awsome products !  
1	  This case is a complete dirt and lint magnet . It is not ideal for a woman who would keep it in her purse .  
1	  The sound quality of these earphones are good , but not at the level I expected for the price ( $ 200 ) . If that was the only issue , I would recommend these SuperFi 5 Pro earphones . But the deal killer here is the cord . To allow the user to shape the cord over the top and behind the ear , there is a flexible wire in the cord . It 's a good idea , but poorly executed . I 've had to replace the cord twice in 18 months ( they run $ 20 plus tax / shipping ) . If you plan on using the small aluminum carrying case to carry it around while traveling , those wires will be bending all the time . And don't look for any sympathy from Ultimate Ears ( now Logitech ) if they break right after the end of the one year warranty . If you buy these earphones , plan on spending money on periodic cord replacement . For these reasons I can't recommend this product .  
2	  This is one of the best products in its class . I purchased this because I wanted to get rid the phantom load from all of my plugged in devices . Most of my commonly used devices are plugged into this neat unit . Before heading to bed , I can switch the power off with just one switch . It also has individual switches so that you can turn each individual devices on or off . There is one outlet that is permanently on . I use this one to plug my external hard drive in because I don't want to accidentally cut off power to the hard drive . This is a must buy for anyone wanting to save some electricity !  
2	  I have used these for the last year or so on a daily basis and have to say they are a phenomenal deal .. quick charging and long lasting , they are as good as the Canon manafactured batteries .. the price is fantastic making it easy to have loads of back-ups on hand .  
1	  The remote control never worked . I was trying something else for a while , cause i thought the remote was working , but today I took my car the the shop , and they tried the GPS unit with another remote , and it worked just fine . Now I can't return the product . so it sucks .  
1	  I 'm always out in the car listening to a good radio show when I get home and want to continue listening . I searched the internet for a portable radio within my means and found this . From the reviews I read it seemed like a reasonable choice . Well don't waste your time . Even with digital tuning I got so much static I could not enjoy listening to the program . I also tried switching to city mode . You could twist the radio around for better reception but it still not give you anything static free .  
2	  I love this mini shelf system . I do however have a sub woofer with mine . Although half of the time I don't use it , because it sounds great without it . I like the fact it has the audio output on the front , it makes it much easier . The groove option really makes a difference on the way it sounds too . My brother and my sister both wanted one just like it . So I bought them both one for Christmas , and I have heard absolutely no complaints . They love it also .  
2	  We had been looking for a CD player for our kitchen and this newly-arrived Sony model is just perfect ! The installation was surprisingly easy , and it looks very stylish under the cabinet . The sound quality is very good . An added bonus is how simple and intuitive all the controls are . Finally , it has several convenient features , including a kitchen timer , iPod plug-in , and multiple disk capacity . Highly recommended !  
1	  This phone is really no good . I used it my business , and I should 've replaced it after the first week . The 3 button doesnt work on the cordless . The cordless has no life . It is constantly dying , even in the middle of a call . Worst phone I ever had . If you put line 1 on hold and go to answer line 2 , sometimes the lines get crossed and you have two people on the same line with no way to remedy the situation but to call them both back . DONT BUY THIS PHONE  
2	  This product works perfectly , with more stuff than Ipods . I would buy another when this breaks or I need a bigger drive in it .  
1	  I wanted something inexpensive for work purposes , when the product was delivered , it looked just fine for what I needed . I put the battery in , and nothing worked . So I went through a bunch of bullcrap . To make a long story short , I payed almost $ 24.00 to recieve this item , sending it back cost me another $ 5.00 , and they decided to refund me $ 14.40 for a piece of junk that I never even got to listen to . So all together it cost me $ 15.00 to write a review for nothing but a hard time . I suggest you don't waste your time on this item , or money .  
2	  Bought this battery as a spare and was not disappointed ( even though I took the Canon battery to the limit ) This battery fit fine in the Canon charger and the camera . For the price I would highly recommend it as a backup . Even if you never use it for 12 bucks you can't go wrong .  
1	  Bad sound . A waste of money . I wanted to use them for hearing Sype , and everybody 's words are muddled .  
2	  I scoured the web to find a quality keyboard / mouse combo for my HTPC . This product works exactly how you want it to . The trackball is responsive and the form factor is comfortable . It plugs right into a free USB drive and off you go . I highly recommend this keyboard in terms of function . The price is competitive as well .  
2	  I give it a 4 out 5 stars . Pro : Cheap , does its job , easy to screw on / off . Con : Annoying reflection . It also saved my lens from destruction . My little cousin accidentally knocked down my tripod with my Nikon on it , and the next thing I know my filter is shattered and in a horrible condition . However , my lens was unharmed & good to go :)  
2	  I love this thing . love it love it , love it .. and I love it even more now that tis is 50.00 and not 250.00 . You can actually * CHOOSE * which photos you want to print .. and you can choose more than one .. so if you have a great pic of some friends , you can print it out for all of them ! - it is a magical little device . really magical . And the best thing , is that it 's * polaroid * nifty little photo-objects , not flimsy needs cutting and can't get wet or touched digital printouts . great pair up with a digital camera with a display on the back . Am I gushing .. yes .. I am .. This is a wonderful thing .  
1	  I would completely agree with the other review that states the DVI port is the only HD port on this TV and it doesn't support HDCP ( New Security for HD content ) . I bought this TV when it first came out thinking it would be useable when more HD content was available .. WRONG ! I just updated my receiver and DVD player and connected them with an HDMI to DVI-D cable thinking I was set for HD . The entire time I was setting up my new receiver and DVD player I was patting myself on the back for having the foresite to buy an HD ready TV . After getting everything setup I get NO picture on this TV and an HDCP error on the receiver because the TV doesn't have the $ % # $ * & $ HDCP security . This was just another $ 5K wasted on technology that isn't supported by the industry or Philips . I just can't believe they are still able to market this TV as HD-Ready when it is quite obvious that HDCP security is going to be required for any device receiving HD content . Also , they are making sure that it 's illegal to provide any kind of adapter in the U.S. that allows the security to be bypassed and older devices ( 3 years or less included ) to be used with the new equipment . Do your homework before you waste this kind of money on a TV.I now have the most expensive computer monitor known to man , which will work until Microsoft finishes their version of HDCP for computers ( Longbow ) and makes it completly obsolete . I am just amazed at the complete lack of knowledge displayed by the so called " expert " reviewers on the Internet and in the stores who seem completely uneducated about this very real easily reproducable issue .  
2	  This product is a great add on for anyone buying a Beltronics or Escort radar detector . It took me less than 15 minutes to install and looks 100 times better than the curly cigaret cord set up . I will be putting a radar detector in my wife 's car in the very near future and I can guarantee this hard-wire cord will be in my basket as well !  
2	  I 've had the JVC Sirius receiver for about 6 months now and have had no problems with it . I like the large screen and the feel of the buttons . Easy to see and use while driving .  
1	  These ear buds are an inexpensive compromise at getting better quality sound from Ear buttons . The Bass is not very strong . Sound quality is acceptable . However , the lack of a carrying container or pouch , plus the fact that they are poor at eliminating external noise , such as airplane engine noise , makes them a poor choice for air travel .  
2	  Said it was used but came in original pack ( never opened ) just the plastic was crimped in one corner .. way better than spending all that money on Battery Tender ..  
2	  I was looking for an affordable lens to take on vacation with me and this one performed great . The large aperture is great for shooting in low light at all focal lengths ( not quite like my 50mm / 1.8 , but I enjoy being able to zoom ) . Part of me wishes I had bit the bullet and gotten the new one with IS , but I got some really nice shots with this lens . I 'm going to get rid of my kit lens because this one is SO much better . Totally worthwhile purchase !  
1	  I bought a pair of Koss plugs two years ago that I like a lot and wanted to get a second pair for work . I thought this pair was the same . Unfortunately I was wrong . The quality on these headphones are poor compared to my original pair . The sound quality is bad and the ear buds are samller and are not as comfortable in mye ears . I really enjoy the pair I had bought two years ago and am disapointed Koss has decided to redcue their quality in these head phones .  
2	  I haven't had the opportunity to listen to it a great deal yet , but it has good sound given that it 's a " boombox " . I have found that inserting the receiver is not as easy as the instructions make it sound . It seems like it 's going in the slot fine , but it 's not sitting just right , so you have to remove it and try again . Usually only takes me 2 times to get it right and the more I do it , the better I get at getting it set on the contacts exactly the way it needs . Overall , a good product though and I know I 'll get a lot of use out of it !  
2	  I absolutely love my Archos AV700 . I used to own the Creative Portable media center , which is a huge pain compared to the archos . synching video to this player is a piece of cake and takes 1/2 the time that creative does . you can also record directly on to the device from your cable box , VCR or DVD player , which you cannot do with any of the other devices . The picture is not as good quality , but for all of the benefits , it is well worth it . The system runs like windows with folder type organization . I highly recommend this device !  
2	  I ordered a new lens cap from Amazon after having a great deal of difficulty locating one locally . So glad I found it listed on Amazon . It arrived to my door step in two days . I found ordering from Amazon to be amazingly simple and efficient . I likewise appreciated them suggesting related products that I might want in the future .. The lens cap arrived to my home in perfect shape . I 'm a satisfied customer !  
2	  Stereo , works , hasn't broken yet after a couple months like others usually do . What else can I say ? I need eleven words .  
2	  So far , this set is great ! It has a nice modern look and the keyboard is slim and compact . The scroll wheel has the smooth gliding feel that is standard on most Microsoft mice . I bought this set because the sets without bluetooth were not performing well at the range I needed . I did lots of research and decided to go with this one but was slightly concerned with some of the other reviews written . I am writing this review to provide additional information that I couldn't find anywhere else and to , hopefully , ease your concerns about other peoples negative reviews . First of all , I don't think the set is 100 percent perfect , but what set is ? We all have personal preferences to where certain keys are placed and things like that . Most of those issues go away after a little practice . I do wish it had a numeric keypad and yes the touch sensitive function keys at the top are very sensitive ( shouldn't be a problem once I get used to it ) . I have an HTPC ( Home Theater PC ) running Windows Vista and setup was extremely easy . The reviewers that had a problem with setup must have something else wrong with their computer . Another reviewer complained that the bluetooth transceiver must be placed in a front USB port . While this may affect range , it is not true . Mine is placed in the back and works perfectly from across my living room ( 14 feet away ) . I started noticing a little keyboard lag sometimes ( as did a lot of other reviewers ) so I tried to figure out what was causing this . I noticed the only time it happened is when certain parts of the keyboard are blocked by something . This must be where the bluetooth sending unit is located . As for the batteries , I did some testing .. it comes with 4 non rechargeable AA akalines for the keyboard and one rechargeable AA NiMH ( Nickel Metal Hydride ) battery for the mouse . Mine came with Energizer brand , the type that can be charged in the standard Energizer charger sold in stores . You don't have to use the mouse charger that comes with this set ( I don't want the clutter in my living room ) . I use a lot of NiMH batteries in my household and already have the standard Energizer charger . I just put an already charged NiMH in the mouse and it worked instantly during setup . This means if your mouse goes dead during use , you just swap out the battery instead of waiting for it to charge . Once you swap out the battery it reconnects on its own . Assuming you already have a device to charge Nimh batteries they do also work in the keyboard , though I don't know how long the battery life will be . There is also an on / off switch on both the keyboard and mouse to preserve battery life .  
1	  i hate itit skips soo easilyi now have a sony DFJ-401 and it works so much betterhorriblego spend your money elsewhereDONT GET ITthere are cd players w / G skip protection for 10 dollars morestay away  
2	  All the reviews are very complimentary about the iPod .. and I agree with all of them . I use the iPod a lot and have had the odd problem / question . This actually prompted me to do some research on the web and find the most common problems / questions on the iPod . Ive listed them below . Feel free to add to this ( does amazon allow that ? ) 1 ) My iTunes is not recognizing my iPodFor Windows users . After connecting an iPod , it doesn't show up in iTunes ( but is seen in My Computer ) . Yeah , this is a pickle . iTunes is the iPod management software , so if it doesn't see the iPod you cannot do anything with it . There are several possible fixes . 2 ) I get the " Do not disconnect " message on my iPod screen . The iPod connects to your computer by way of a USB port . All devices that connect using USB must be " unmounted " before you unplug them . The " Do Not Disconnect " message lets you know that you still have to unmount the iPod . 3 ) How do I convert my movies ( DVD ) to view on my iPod ( video ) ? Convert DVD filed into iPod format . Follow these simple steps . How to transfer music from ipod to itunes ( computer ) . Basically , in order to transfer songs from the iPod to your computer , you have to undermine the design of the iPod . Whenever you use a device in a way it 's not designed , you increase the chances that it 'll break . That said , a lot of people have done this with no problems and it 's a real life saver if your computer crashed and you lost your whole iTunes music library . 4 ) How do I use my ipod as a Hard drive : Havent foubd a great way to do this . 5 ) ipod Battery problemIm guessing majority of these is bcos people have not charged it ! 6 ) iPod FrozenIve seen this soo many times .. has actually never happened to me yet . Will do some more research and post solutions to this .  
1	  For the price , this is a good headset with mic . I mainly use it for Skype . A very annoying problem is that the mic on / off is a button , rather than a switch . This means you can inadvertently turn it off when you bump on the in-line controller while moving around , although it has a red LED to indicate the off state . This happens more often than I like , so be forewarned if you plan to use the mic a lot .  
1	  I bought this under the assumption then because the item title said ' 6 conductor ' it actually would be . As you can see by my rating - not so much . It 's only a 4 conductor coupler and it 's a different brand . Stay away from this seller .  
2	  I bought this product with the intention of wiring my whole house , I have kicked off the project and so far the cable has been easy to install with the kit and works as expected .  
1	  Read the other reviews . I agree with all the negative comments , especially about it not having nonskip ability . I should have read the reviews first before purchasing the product .  
1	  these are some of the worse headphones i have tested the sound is horrible and tiny using an ipod touch no bass what so ever . i guess i have not learnt my lesson sony seems to have the best sounding headsets for this price range .  
2	  I have four of these . I work out of the home and have flakey power . I have a Windows PC , Linux Server , DSL modem , router and wireless access point in several different rooms . Every time the power would blip I would have to wait for all of this equipment to reset / reboot before I could get back to work and I would lose whatever I was working on last . Although these don't have much power they do keep me up in the blips and give me enough time to shut every thing down properly in case the outage is longer than a blip . A pretty cheap solution that works great .  
1	  This thing has poor sound quality ! All the " S " and " SH " sounds hiss . It 's irritating ! And the slightest movement of your iPod produces static . ATTENTIONThose with the cigarette lighter right by the stick shift , this product is NOT for you ! Can't shift to first or third with this thing plugged in . I returned this the same day I bought and exchanged it for the Monster iCarPlay Wireless Plus . Monster is waay better ! From the reviews for Kensington , I thought it was the best . I should 've taken the advice from a friend and bought the Monster one instead . The Monster one feels better made than the Kensington . But the sound is 100 times better . No hissing sound or static . If you 're going to buy an FM Transmitter / Car Charger , buy theMONSTER ICARPLAY WIRELESS PLUSYou 'll be very happy with the Monster one .. TRUST ME !  
2	  Used it this past weekend at a gig and it performed well .. Will definitely buy more when needed . Loved the price too !  
2	  I am a rookie-photographer and did some research before I bought this lens for my wife . She 's excited about the hobby of photography and I 'm excited to support her . However , I 'm not excited to discover that photography can be quite expensive as many can attest . That being said , for not a lot of money and with my limited understanding , this lens is great for beginners and easy to use in order to get a relatively tight shot on faraway objects , or a good dramatic contrast between foreground and background in a variety of light fields and speeds of subjects . My wife and I just got back from Europe ( France , Germany , Austria ) and we took this lens and the 18-55mm lens of the same caliber . On her Craigslist-bought Nikon D40 , both lenses captured some really beautiful shots of castles , countrysides , city-streets and confined areas . Not all shots were professional quality by any means ( I 'll chalk some of that up to personal ugliness of the subject , user error and unlearned behavior ) - but I 'd personally choose many of our shots from this lens to be airbrushed and put on postcards .. some of the shots are actually better than some postcards I saw in Europe - TAKE THAT postcard-makers ! My wife tells me she hopes to get one in the next year or two that has a lower aperture setting and that is several steps above this lens . I 'm already looking into selling my internal organs to pay for it . But for now , for the first step , for the money , and for the experience you can get in shooting pictures , this lens is great . On a completely related subject , anybody interested in buying a lightly-used , okay-quality , right-half of a brain ?  
1	  I so wanted HP to satisfy me-I like the company and hoped it would be a great laptop . However I have been repeatedly so disappointed that I decided to never again buy an HP computer-and I buy one a year . the computer does strange things for no reason .. and example is the common problem among HP users : the CapsLock key constantly " sticks " and can't be unstuck without rebooting , among other strange happenings . HP Customer service is so bad I simply decided to forget them and never buy HP again . It is too bad-this was once a great company .. I hope for their resurrection some day to half their once-great status . I was cheering for them , but all they did was disappoint me .  
2	  i primarily bought this because of a problem i was having where i LOVE the sound and 20min recording capacity of my samsung .. yet i loved the nikon d3100 's still photos . so once while recording video of the oregon marching band and trying to take stills i thought " itd be perfect if i can mount this on the DSLR .. " bam ! this was it . now i can have both my hands on the dslr and shoot video from the samsung all at once . the height difference isnt significant its bearable or hardly unnoticeable . the samsung fits perfectly on it , and the mount fits snugly into the shoe of the d3100 without damaging either camera . some may think " why not buy a recorder instead ? " 1 ) to save $ and 2 ) the D3100 is limited to 10min , samsung is 20min . 3 ) i can take stills AND video at the same time !  
1	  I bought this at best buy cause it was a great deal . $ 2080 . With one year to pay it off . It had great connectivity : 2 hdmi , 1 dvi , 2 firewire , 2 component , 3 s-video / composite . But when it came down to it this baby could NOT candle motion . It would break up and look TERRIBLE and that was the Hi-Def ! The standard def left motion trails and that was from a progressive scan dvd ! Great on paper but doesn't deliver the goods . I returned ( b . s . - ed that it was broke to avoid a " restocking fee " ) and got me the 61 inch samsung hl-s6187 . Now that 's a frickin performer . Not as much in the way of connectivity but the picture is amazing ( as good as CRT but way smaller package ) . So buyer beware on this one . Oh and the contrast ratio on this Mits is atrocious ! Something like 545:1 ! The samsung does 10000:1 !  
1	  I use Windows 7 Home Edision 64 bit . After lots of effort , the connection is still on and off . Besides , the company technical support has little help .  
2	  This is great for the Mac users among us that may not have a USB2 port yet . Trnasfer over USB can be very long this reader takes care of that with its Firewire capability . Well constructed comes with a cable . Works great for me for use with my desktop or portabe .  
1	  The key press feel , keyboard weight are good to excellent for my taste . I would love to love this keyboard but there are two serious flaws . I 'm not sure if it is Windows specific , in any case , even if it is , I 'd still not trust a hardware keyboard that only works with one OS . First , the blank key that some complained about is a " Fn " key . The ridiculous part in this is that the functions keys are by default in the " special functions " mode . I need to hold down Fn in order to press the regular " F1 " " F2 " etc . Common combo keys in applications such as Excel Shift-F3 becomes Fn + Shift + F3 . Mind you , the order you press the keys is also important . Shift-Fn-F3 does not work . I 'd expect this Fn key to be a toggle . Press once to switch to F1 / F2 / F3 , press again to use the media / function keys . The second , and fatal flaw is that every few mins , the keyboard becomes unresponsive for about 10-15 seconds and starts working again by itself . ( I 'll test this keyboard on a mac and then update this review again ) Update 1/10/2013Today it started too repeat certain keystrokes . As you can see , I'mm just t typing this mmessage wwithout correcting the e crap ccoommining ffrroom tthhis kkeeyboarradd ..  
1	  One touch recording ? I could not find it . This is not the type of instrument that you can take out of the box and run with . It is overly complicated and the instructions are horrendously written - if not often outrightly wrong . I could not find one important screen per the instructions where it should have been . Actually it did not exist but its alternative was found by accident elsewhere . This machine operates counter-intuitively . It is hard to figure out what is going on since there is little on-screen interaction once recording is started . Now there is the whole issue of the value of this machine . After laborously making a copy of a vhs onto a dvd , I discovered that the target tv / dvd player did not accomodate the dvd-ram format . It seems like using this machine is a crap shoot as to whether the disk will be compatable elsewhere . Unfortunately , the industry has not standardized much yet . I will say that Panasonic has the best phone technical support I ever encountered [ fyi , I am a former tech support manager myself and no stranger to technology ] . However , one needs to keep calling to get through and judging by the wait time of twenty minutes or so , many others are finding this product difficult to use as well . I only bought this unit for the most basic of needs : copying vhs tapes to dvd 's . I could not imagine how much more difficult it would be to do the fancier applications . I am wondering out loud if it would have been cheaper and easier for people like me to just pay someone to make the copies in the first place .  
2	  I created a dark green and white Hello Kitty Cheerleader logo in photoshop then added GO PACK . Printed it out , ironed it on to a dark mustard yellow tshirt - looks fantastic no see thru in the white parts . I 've washed it four times no fading ! My kids are dying to make shirts of their own ( that will get a little expnsive )  
1	  This product has the potential to be tremendous , but due to poor packaging design the inside of the plastic was scratched . That absolutely ruins the iPod video experience , now that there is LCD glare exposing all the scratches . Also , there is a big ' rhigo-skin ' logo on the front , which makes the case even that more distracting . I 'm sure that it isn't polycarbonate because it scratches with my fingernail . What a letdown . P.S. if you are buying the 30GB version of this case , it will double the thickness of your setup .  
2	  the lide 25 scanner by canon will scan documents to pdf format , tiffile jpeg , photo shop and will allow you to do other things that im learning to do as I use it more and more each day .  
2	  I use Google Talk quite a lot with friends and family so I was looking for something affordable yet good quality to replace a cheap standing microphone I had . The Plantronics . Audio 450 headset fits all my requirements . It is light , stays clipped on to my ears and I don't have to bother with leaning in close to or holding the microphone any more . I highly recommend this to anyone on a budget who needs a headset just for basic chatting and video calls .  
2	  I purchased two of these back when 2 GB was a lot of storage - and they have been performing well for the past five years .  
2	  Some time the modem is disconnected with D-Link DIR-655 wireless router . I 've to turn off both the modem & router , then turn them on again . The problem usually happen one or two times a day . I did contact with the customer services of D-Link ( for router ) and Motorola ( for modem ) , the technical representatives of each side ( D-Link or Motorola ) said that the problem related to the other device , not their " company device " ( ? ) . No body know which device - D-Link DIR-665 router or Motorola SB5101 modem - has had the problem so far ( ? ) william  
2	  My Creative Zen player died on me ( through carelessness on my own part ) and I decided to get a replacement . I was looking for another mp3 player but spotted this instead . Afer much deliberation - I only wanted to spend under $ 100 on an mp3 player , so I had to take in account the other features that come with this - I decided to go for it . And I have not regretted it since . Like I mentioned in review title , this is strictly non-technical , because I am as layman a user as you can get , so the technical stuff just go over my head . I will simply tell you what I like about this player and why I feel every penny spent is justified . I 'm not someone who will read the whole manual , and I 'd rather just start using and learn as I use the item . Only when I am stuck or something bad happens do I start looking through , therefore everything I say here is from my own experience with my player . This might be a good review for someone else like me . My findings : The screen is very good , the picture is clear and the angle of view is good . My friends and I crowded around it when I first got it , and everyone could see clearly what was shown on the screen . The sound on the built-in speaker isn't that great for songs , but for watching a movie , it works good . It plays everything I have downloaded so far . When the format or file is unsuitable , the software automatically tells you to convert . All you have to do is follow the steps and the files will be changed to fit into the player . It will even transfer the file when the conversion is finished . Granted , conversion takes a while ( I don't know what a standard time to convert a full movie file is though ) but usually I leave it to convert and transfer while I sleep and everything 's done by the time I wake up . I love how I can just leave it to work while I go away or to sleep . The files you download , if under a folder , will automatically be transferred under a folder of the same name . I haven't worked out if I can move the files around in the player yet ( when hooked to the computer ) , because I would like to just have all movies under one folder instead of having 20 differently named folders with 1 movie in each . But some people might like this aspect , so it 's a personal issue for me . A small thing that I like is that the album picture of the song you 're playing will be displayed when you play the song . This is not the case for all songs , especially if downloaded from unknown sources online . But if you ripped it from your cds , it should display the picture . I 'm still a little confused about how the fast forward and rewind button works . It seems that for some movies it will simply skip to bookmarked points , whereas others it will work as if it 's a VCR and you have to stop it . When in such a " VCR mode " , picture doesn't run while in fast forward or rewind , so you 'll need to get used and I bet you 'll be able to estimate well with experience . There are a few view modes on this player , Fit to Screen , Stretch to Full , Zoom to Full & Original Size . I find myself using Zoom to Full when viewing widescreen movies . The Stretch to Full makes everything look out of proportion , so I 'm not touching that . I tried the built in microphone once to record my friend snoring from about 2 feet away . I couldn't hear it when I play back on the built-in speaker but I can hear the snoring when I use the headphones . Another instance I recorded my friends and I chatting normally while sitting at different positions in a enclosed room , and we could hear just fine from the speakers when we play it back . So it might be ok for normal volume recording but most likely you 'll use it for personal voice recording . I don't know if it 's a technical issue , but I 'm bummed that you can't use the fm radio without using the headphones . It 'd have been nice to be able to set it down and listen to the radio sometimes . I haven't had the player go flat on me yet - it charges up whenever it 's plugged through the USB , so I never have to worry about it . I only plug it in with the adaptor when I am in a hurry to charge it up , otherwise I wait till I am transferring files on it . It gives good playback life , although I haven't really timed it . All I know is I bring it with me on the road and after watching 2 or 3 movies , it 's still not out . The auto-shutdown feature is great because there will be the occasion when you just forget to turn it off and you 'll be glad that it didn't run flat because of that . I uploaded photographs and although the quality of the pictures isn't perfect ( you get that compressed look ) , it 's more than sufficient to be able to view the photographs in detail . You can even rate your pictures so that you can view only pictures from a certain rating that you wish . Of course , the slideshow feature is always a good thing . Plugging the player into the tv was easy ! Once plugged in , your tv screen will reflect what is shown on the player . All you have to do is select your movie / music / photo slideshow and play as per normal ! It 's that simple ! A lot of people have complained about the size of it , though I admit it is a little bulky , I don't see the point of having a tiny player which will come with a tiny screen and then you won't be able to view much anyway . So for my viewing enjoyment , I 'll gladly accept the size :) Hope this has been helpful to you !  
1	  This drive failed on me at a critical moment in the field . I had only owned it for 6 months , and it was not used very intensively . It spent its short life in my laptop satchel and was never dropped or otherwise damaged . During a photo shoot , I tried to copy data from my full laptop hard drive to the Passport . The drive simply would not work . It was powered on and spinning but the computer could not see it or use it . After trying to get it working , it began making clicking noises and I determined it to be dead . I 'd hate to think that being jostled in my bag was enough to cause this drive to fail . If that 's the case , then it has serious durability issues .  
2	  I have 2 mp3 players , both are Irivers but the first one I purschased had a realy huge hard drive and some became really cumbersom to load music then search and listen for tracks i actually had saved . With this new product im finding with the smaller memory i can load playlist that i want to listen too and easily swap out and finds tracks im interested in hearing . Its a nice piece of equipment and i wouldnt trade it for nothing .  
2	  Worked for me and my batteries . ONce I got the batteries charged they worked fine up to the point I needed .  
2	  This is a good beginner SW radio till i can afford a better one . I read all the reviews and knew what to expect . I have a KAITO SW / AM / FM with the MP3 recorder player worked good till i dropped something on it and broke MP3 modual anyway LCD screen on that radio was way to small for my old eyes . This one finaly went down in price so i bought it nice big lighted display and great audio for the one ear i can hear out of after stroke i had a few years ago . With one of those wind up antennas i had receives pretty good . I think when i save a bit i will get a Grundig 750 till then this will do just fine . I am using AA battery 's 4 Sanyo Eneloops but for me only works for about two long days of listening then they go down one bar on display out of four have not tried D battery 's yet . \ But it does work good with wall wart with no interference .  
1	  Cables were included . I had problem with the mouse responsiveness horizontally on the screen . I could not find a setting to fix the problem . If I removed the switch box the mouse worked fine .  
1	  Well , I learned one thing from ordering this product . Porttronics has a wonderful customer service department . I had to return two Delphi SkyFi CD Audio systems due their failure to work . The first one worked for a day and then the speakers quit . The second one , the CD player would not work at all . The third one works but there is interference when playing CD 's but only when it is reading the CD into memory . It is a great concept but the follow through with quality production is just not there . On the other hand I would recommend Pottronics ( them being one of the many companies partnered with Amazon ) to any Amazon customers due to their excellent customer service .  
1	  " THIS TRIPOD IS JUNK " , " truly a useless product " .. some reviewers comment like these . I don't usually believe those comments with strong words . After 3 month of light use , I had become another looser of this awful product . Flip-lock system is far quicker , but I chose twist-lock system because of its clean look . I trusted its durability because of the brand name and its history . It has a quite high price so I expected to have more than decent quality . Followings are my story :[ 2 month later ] After light uses of the tripod , first sign of problem had appeared . Symptom was a difficulties of locking or loosening the legs . It seemed to be jammed shims inside the legs . [ 3 mouth later ] Broken white plastic ( nylon ? ) shims came out . So I disassembled the legs to see the mechanism inside . White shims are paper thin and crispy so they don't have physical strength . Bad design and engineering . Even if you see positive reviews , those owner 's tripods won't last long because of bad design and crappy materials . I must speak out for many innocent photographers who is seeking decent tripods . This is the one to loose your money and important shots .  
1	  worked a very little bit then quit . would not buy this again . 8 more words re qu re d don  
1	  Levers don't work . They are just decorative . Blurry pictures . No focus even . You can't even FOCUS this hundred dollar plus toy . It 's not even cute . It 's not just plastic , but LOOKS plastic .  
1	  This print server works - but buyer beware : printing is slow if anything large ( like photos or other graphic objects ) are printed . All Netgear print servers have only 64 KB ( ! ) buffer ( according to their Web site ) , and this shows . So if performance is a primary concern , look elsewhere . The manufacturer 's claim that this device would remove any bottleneck is FAR from the truth - in contrary , using a PC and sharing the printer attached to it gives MUCH better performance . Due to this , I 'm still contemplating whether to return this thing or not . Luckily I got it much cheaper than the current Amazon price :-) Another thing is that since the printer is hooked up through the print server , the printer status monitor does not work for some reason . So I can not see how much ink do the cartridges have , for instance . This is annoying , but I could live with it if printing wasn't this slow .  
2	  It did just what I wanted , had no problems . I can take and use it any car , love playin my own music  
1	  Bought for a 5.5G iPod Video . Loose fit . Included spacers did not allow a fit at all . Sound quality was muffled and staticky , regardless of which radio station I used ( I tried ALL of them ) .  
1	  This product is not able to be used with Windows Vista . Beware .  
2	  I bought this camera for when I do wedding photography ! It is awesome ! Love it !  
1	  i got this one for my self cuase it was so pretty got it does not work headphones are horrid buy the pink bubble one from gpx instead it works headphones are better it is just plin better quality  
1	  I bought this power supply to power a Viair 85p air compressor . When these items arrived I read all of the instructions provided for both devices and the compressor worked beautifully . The second time that I tried to use my compressor , the power supply would only tell me that there was a fault . Even though the instructions said that it would reset itself it never worked again . I returned the power supply and now use the compressor connected directly to my car battery and it works fine that way .  
1	  It 's a decent BluRay player so I gave it two stars , but the reason I bought this unit was for the Internet apps , which are a real disappointment . They are worse than worthless . I say worse than worthless because not only are they so clunky and slow no one would use them , Samsung forces you to wait to use the device until even more new worthless apps are pushed to you ! It pushes new worthless applications until the memory is maxed out . When you connect if often installs an " update " ( with no way to opt out ) which can take 15 minutes or more installing things you don't want during which the system is inaccessible . If you delete apps , next time you connect it reloads them again . The exceptions are Vudu , Blockbuster , and Pandora . These at least work as you would expect . Youtube would be nice if it was full featured like the Web site , which it is definitely not . You can't even access your playlists , in fact more than half the time I can't log in to my YouTube account at all on this BluRay player . Samsung support is a joke . But you already knew that ..  
1	  A good starter camera . If you never used a digital camera before this one is for you . Easer to operate then a film camera turn the dial to auto and snap away . I got it for our 8 year old she mastered it and was taking pictures in five minutes an older women relative who never even seen one before was Abel to master it in two . It doesn't have all the gadgets or settings that the others have but that is part of it 's appeal for older or younger picture takers . If you can use a film camera you can use this digital . You might even be able to use this one if you cant figure out a film camera . And it takes just as good a picture as most film cameras . In short if you have been scared to go digital because you don't think you can figure out how to use it this one is for you .  
2	  I bought this MP3 player for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas and I have not been disappointed . She uses it constantly and loves it ! I am the one who puts the music on it for her and have not had any problem with this . The player comes with software to effectively and easily organize , add , and create playlists . My daughter had no trouble learning to use the player . About five minutes of instruction from me and she was on her way to learning the rest on her own . The player has great sound and is especially great for little fingers because of the small joystick operation . The picture and video quality on this player is fantastic as well . I have about 250 songs on her player already and there is still tons of memory space left . Excellent all around ! I would recommend the following accessories : colorful skin to both protect and jazz up your player , a DC charger for times when you can't charge using the USB on your computer , and a carrying case as the one supplied with the player is a small bag and is difficult to get everythig into . Don't hesitate to buy !  
2	  I am new to dSLR world , but I have expected a little better lenses . Otherwise , great setup and great experience with this product . I plan to buy better lenses very soon .  
1	  The listing indicates that this is an auto-focus ( AF ) lens . The box and the documentation that came all indicated that it was an AF lens . The actual lens itself was not an AF lens . I don't know if this was just a mistake on someones part ( accidentally put the wrong lens in the box ) or what . I was very disappointed . I ended up returning it and purchasing theNikon 55-200mm f / 4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR [ Vibration Reduction ] Zoom Nikkor Lensfor $ 65 more and I am very happy with it . I will say that the quality of the Sigma lens itself was very acceptable for a budget oriented lens . It fit well and operated smoothly . The Amazon return process was very easy and went smoothly - I appreciated that .  
1	  My reception was bad with the big roof top antena I already owned . This product added nothing to my reception , another customer I talked to at Best Buy , said he bought the same unit , and it did absolutely nothing for him either . I suggest you talk to a professional before installing any of these products . How many TV 's connect into the same antena and how far / long is the cabling from the antena to the TV , this information is good to have .  
1	  I bough those for about 20 bucks at local walmart and wish I havn't wasted money . For over the computer internet chats the sound quality is preatty good but the really bad part is the design . The microphone is way to short and is resting on your cheek when wareing , the ear phones are also uncomfortable since there is no left / right side you can put them on both ways . Fot this kinna money there are better products out there . Stay away from this one .  
2	  This is my first MP3 player , and I love it ! It was really easy to transfer my music and videos and is very easy to use . I 've got 450 songs and a few home videos on it , and still have well over 50 % disc space available . I bought a leather case in a bright color so it 's easy to find when I set it down , but mostly so the screen will be protected . I 'm looking forward to getting an FM transmitter so I can listen to all my favorite songs while I 'm driving . I 'd definitely recommend this !  
2	  This is the best phone headset ! I wore one out , and purchased this one to replace it . Everyone can hear me clearly , and the under the ear headset can be quickly placed in your ear comfortably . There is an extra cord you can purchase to adapt to your cell phone if you wish .  
2	  My only concern is there is one pixel abnormal : when the screen goes blank , that pixel still remains blue . I hope it doesn't matter too much .  
2	  This is a great little GPS and has just about everything you reallyneed for a very reasonable price . I 'm impressed .  
1	  Unfortunately I only read good reviews back when I bought my DVD player . For all those considering the purchase today , don't do it ! I guess I 'm one of the lucky ones . My unit lasted for 18 months before dying . Panasonic should be shot for their lack of attention to this issue . I 'll never buy another product from them .  
1	  I got this telescope for my desk at work because I have a decent view . It stinks , I think I can see better with my naked eye . Plus you can not focus it because the slider is so stiff . I guess I will be buying another telescope now .  
1	  I recently got this product and found it to look much better on the internet than in real life . This case feels very cheap and is just a plastic case with som metal glued to the outside . Also the only hole in the case is on the top , so when I put it in my cradle I have to take it out of this case every time , why would the hole be on the top ? . Also the case fold won't fold to the back so when open all the way the case flap gets in the way of holding the palm .  
2	  I bought three of these for our office . The look and feel is a big improvement over the Palm V. I like the color screen that is so easy to read . Being able to show photos of our work to clients is a nice feature . Overall it is much faster in all respects than the old model . Negatives : Why did they do away with the syncing cradle ? It looks messy and is cumbersome to have to deal with plugging the Palm in everytime you are at your desk . In addition , you cannot read the display if it lays flat . Try tilting it up and resting it on something without it sliding off again-very difficult . My other gripe is the sycing software . It took me hours to get it to work on at least one of the Palms . The other one still doesn't bring over all my contacts from Outlook . Tech support only sent me promises of help so far , no solution . Why can't they make products that work out of the box ?  
1	  After having this camera for only 5 months , the infamous E18 message showed up on my camera ( something having to do with the lens ) and the manufacturer refused to fix this problem without me first paying a $ 108 fee when the camera itself cost me just under $ 200 . That 's like paying for half the camera again . I definitely do not recommend buying ANY canon powershot products .  
1	  I want to love these headphones . They are comfortable , they sound great , they noise isolate as well as any other set I own , and no wires ! Other reviews say the range isn't great , but that isn't important to me - I generally have my iPod in backpack , bag , or pocket and just don't want wires dangling around me . I was all set to give these a 5 , but then I had a synchronization problem . I had my iPod in my hands , my headphones in my ears , and for whatever reason , I just couldn't hear the music - in fact , the little green light wouldn't come on on the transmitter - but the operation is just plug and play - couldn't have been a user error on my part . I sat on a plane between Portland , Oregon and Washington , D.C. , cursing my headphones the whole way . Now the operation appears to be intermittent . I have no idea under what condition they will decide to work and when they won't , so I end up carrying a spare pair of earbuds with me .  
2	  Love the case , but I should have bought it elsewhere , paid as much for shipping as the case cost .  
2	  Great deal . Had one before before and my brother broke it , but bought another one because its the best product out there for the value and quality !  
1	  I am used to a responsive camera . I owe a Canon Rebel XT and 30D , but bought this camera based on its reviews . This camera 's response time is SLOW . The subject is standing still yet it still has a noticable lag in shooting . This results in mostly lousy shots . The subject blinks ( even though I count 1-2-3 ) . Mostly I shoot people . In summary , I have to delete 90 % of my shots . Maybe its OK for scenery as the lens is sharp . I don't care how many pixels a sensor has . The camera has to be responsive . I would rate this one star at best . Save your money .  
1	  It 's quite disappointing that the black pack which carries the manuals , cleaning cloth and the MacOS DVD 's doesn't have the DVD 's in it on my new Macbook Pro purchased :( Amazon , please send me the original DVD 's ASAP  
1	  I purchased a ReplayTV 5060 and within 2 weeks it broke . The product was absolutely amazing .. When is was working . I spent 2 1/2 weeks on the phone trying to get the product returned to ReplayTV ( because I purchased it directly from them ) and they gave me a run-around that was absolutely insulting . When I finally did get it shipped back to them ( with my own money ) , they sent a BROKEN UNIT in its place back . My opinion is to NOT get one of the older models , no matter how cheap the deal is because ReplayTV is awful at keeping customers with broken units happy .  
2	  I like the Cobra radar to an extent but , for the most part its ok . See , it takes along time to pick up the signals and by the time it picks up the signals there is the cop , but that is not on only the case . It is effective sometimes but not all of the time .  
2	  I did a lot of research before I bought the DC-280 and the thing that sold me was the reviews of faithful color reproduction . I have not been disapointed . It takes great pics indoor and out . I can even tell you it is rugged . After falling to the floor off a counter top it still performed flawlessly . The colors are vivid , the light range is quite good and it is simple to operate . I recommend a second set of rechargable batteries and a second flash memory card .  
1	  I had high hopes for this because the family PC is in the same room as the tv and it would be nice to be able to use the keyboard in the dark . However , after only 2 weeks of light use the several keys and the spacebar just stopped working . I did a search online and apparently this is a common problem . I did not try a second one given the history . I 'll wait until one of the major manufacturers comes out with a similar product .  
1	  Avoid these headphones at all costs , especially if you would buy these to listen with while you work out . Mine lasted for about a month and a half before the cord started decomposing . The material used is very poor , the white turns yellow and then disintegrates just through normal use . If you are considering these for working out , don't buy them , they will not stay in your ears . That is assuming you sweat when you workout , these will slip out and just become more of an annoyance than anything .  
1	  These speakers are disappointing on all counts . They are quiet-even at full volume they are only slightly louder than my computer 's internal speakers . They sound terrible-with disproportionately round bass and tinny , metallic-sounding treble . They also regularly turn themselves off as part of a power-saving mode that is nowhere mentioned in the product description , the packaging , or the instructions . I bought these on sale as part of an Amazon lightning deal , and even at thirty dollars I felt these were not a good buy . But they did teach me to better appreciate the muddy sound of my iMac 's tiny internal speakers-which , overall , I much prefer to what the JBL Duet produces .  
2	  We 've had this remote for years now . It 's perfect ! Super easy to program . So much nicer than having over 5 remotes for our entertainment systems . Easy to use . Our 5 year old uses it every Saturday morning for cartoons ! :) We just cleaned the contacts recently . Works like it 's brand new !  
2	  Sound is excellent . Super lightweight , great case , plus the color makes them easy to spot if they fall out of your backpack . Couldn't ask for anything more is such a convenient package  
1	  Yes it is true . Mine only lasted 4 months . Stay away from this product .  
1	  This case is well made and it will surely protect your new F10 digital camera , but it is much larger than it really needs to be . An F10 by itself is small and easy to carry around . Once inside this case , the camera becomes unwieldy and it is no longer much fun to take around with you . I regret buying this case . I suggest you look for a slimmer ( and cheaper ) one .  
2	  This product was great and had no problems . I was having trouble with a cheap optical cord that I had given to me a while back so it was time to get another one . I have no problems from this item and it gets the job done !  
1	  The video playback is good . The music player could be a lot more streamlined . Too many clicks to switch from shuffle to normal play , etc . The WI-FI is probably not worth the extra money . The browser isn't capable of much , and the touchscreen keyboard is a pain . Support from the manufacturer is pretty weak . I need to replace the screen . Pricing starts at $ 162.50 . That 's more than this mediocre player costs . The customer service guy acted like I was wasting his valuable time as he asked for my information . I would not recommend this unless you get it for a really , really low price . Not worth the trouble .  
1	  The screws holding the HDMI connector to the plastic plate are small and break easily . I was pulling my receiver away from the wall which must have put tension on the bracket and it snapped . Unfortunate after spending $ 10 on it . Other than that , its worked well . Just be careful with it .  
2	  I received the black Zune as a Christmas present and am enjoying it so far . The device itself seems to have nearly everything I wanted in a personal audio / video device . What would make it a 5-star device is A / V mini-jack compatibility ( video-out through the headphones ) , line-out in addition to headphone out , and a built-in FM transmitter . The internal software could probably be re-worked as updates occur , but I 'd like to see an option - per song - to adjust the preset EQ . The Zune software itself is pretty slick , though I 'm having trouble adjusting from my former favorite , MediaMonkey . The main feature I look for in media managers such as Zune or MediaMonkey is their ability to tag more easily and efficiently . MediaMonkey pulls song information from Amazon through a simple search system that I really like . The Zune software mysteriously updates songs as it sees fit - I didn't find anywhere to query the Zune catalog and refine my results . Sometimes I don't care if the metadata is the * right * data , just pertinent . And it is 2007 ( mostly ) now , shouldn't the Zune software and device fully recognize ID3 tags in their entirety ? How cool would it be to have access to all the ID3 tag information on the handheld ( e.g. lyrics , composer , year , genre , etc . ) .  
1	  First , the screen on the camera is a " status " screen , not a viewing screen-so you have no idea if the pictures you take come out or not . It 's also very cheap and plasticy-no way this ever sold for $ 99-don't be fooled by the " marked down " price . I am very disappointed .  
1	  For all the good things that have been said and written about these headphones , if you can't tolerate how they FEEL on your ears , the sound quality is worthless . Try them on for several hours-then decide . I planned to use these to replace BOSE 1 's ( stolen from luggage cart ) and 2's-left behind on the plane , and swiftly gone . After trying them on a trans-con flight last week , I actually had to remove the ATs and switch to the airline 's cheepos to survive to the end of the movie . I wrote to Audio-Technica about the problem-mainly the stitching and rough inner fabric that irritate the ears , at least MY ears . They replied promptly and constructively , but had no fix for the problem and suggested I return them to the retailer . ( Unfortunately for me , the retailer 's 14-day return period is over . )  
2	  This is an excellent camera bag for the city . It has many cool features , especially the hidden rain jacket to keep your precious camera dry in rainy weather . Given this is the 200AW with more room , I end up making a home for my extra lenses and flash . The weight can be a burden after several hours strapped onto only one shoulder . I would not go on long hikes with this bag ( that 's when I use the top loader attached to my day pack ) . This is my favorite bag for everyday use !  
1	  I purchased this VCR after reading some of the postive reviews on this site . It worked for 1 day and then began a strange whirring noise when I turned the power on and would not recognize that it had a tape in it and then would just cut off . I am returning it tomorrow for my money back . I should have known it was crap when I took it out of the box and it weighed about a pound . My old Magnavox VCR was of a substantial weight and lasted 10 years of continuous use . I spent $ 95 on this Panasonic and would recommend spending your money on something else .  
1	  I bought the Terk antenna in an attempt to pick up some AM and FM radio stations I was struggling with on my new bookshelf stereo system . Perhpas because of my apartment building , or the quality of the stereo , the antenna didn't offer me much success in picking up stations any better than the factory-provided antenna . I did notice improvement in the static ( or lack of it ) on stations that were already tuning in fairly well ( they went from great to excellent ) , but the stations that were tuning in " poorly " got no better with the Terk antenna . Overall , it was probably not worth the money paid .  
2	  I had originally used the Marware case and clip-on running band when I ran , but the case would quickly desintegrate after a few months . I decided to give this brand a try after getting fed up of constantly buying a product I knew would eventually wear out . This case hasn't broken down yet ( knock on wood ) , but I did notice on my run the ipod would jiggle a little bit . I have an ipod classic 160GB though , so it 's a little heavy in general which is something to keep in mind . I 'm just happy the ipod fit . The mechanics of the case though is a little cumbersome . The headphone connector is a little awkward given that the input has to be inserted through the case itself . The touch sensor wheel to move the volume and music selector is unable to move through the plastic cover too becuase it 's a little too thick . Because of this , I have to take the ipod out of the case in order adjust anything which can get quite annoying when the ipod is already strapped to your arm . All in all the armband does it 's job , and if I just keep my music on shuffle , I really don't have a problem .  
1	  I bought this AC adaptor on January 7th and it is now March 20 and it has stopped working . I have check to make sure there is a 110 volts coming in , but nothing is coming out !  
2	  I am happy with this headset , this is my second one ordered and it works very well . However , I have to give it only 4 stars since my first one after one year , developed a short in the 2.5mm connector and it was unusable . I did not treat it roughly in any way . I thought I would give a new unit a second try so we will see .  
2	  I have not had it very long , however it seem 's to work fine . Potatos doe 's great , shredding cheese and hash browns great . Chopping so so .  
2	  These really are some great headphones , I have gone through a lot of different types , some more expensive than these . The sound quality is outstanding and the buds also stay in my ear when I work out .. which has been the biggest issue that I have had with other earbud type headphones . It is worth the few extra bucks for a great pair of headphones , and they have gotten cheaper since I first tried them out .  
2	  I bought these because of the good reputation of Taiyo Yuden . However , they are not marked Taiyo Yuden anywhere , pretty generic packaging . When tested with Nero , they did reveal a Taiyo Yuden code and they are a little thicker than other DVD-R 's and slightly rounded on the edge . I 've never had a burning error with them ( 60 discs ) and I tested a few discs after burning with Nero and they got very good marks . I compared them with the Memorex DVD-R 's I had been using and they rated about the same . Taiyo Yuden reportedly use superior dyes and have a long-life . The discs are definitely a little sturdier or thicker than most any other . The only problem I 've had with them is that my Lite-on DVR 5045 will not read any of the discs . They play fine on my Philips , LG , or the PC ( Samsung ) , but not on the DVR . Pros : Quality manufacturer brand ( Most name brands are outsourced and quality can vary ) , Sturdy , Gives good quality burns . Cons : No brand marking , Won't play on my specific DVR but does play on 3 other DVD players with no problems .  
2	  I am really satisfied with my yepp . It 's tiny and really easy to put in your pocket . It only requires one AA battery , in contrast to a lot of players that require two batteries . Also , the yepp lasts for a while on that battery ( and if you get rechargeable batteries , it costs next to nothing to use ) . The software for downloading mp3 's to the yepp is a little tricky , but once you get the hang of it it 's not so bad . And it 's much more powerful than other software I 've used . The only drawback is that you can't add more memory . But the 64 megs is enough to hold 15 or so songs , so it 's not really necessary .  
1	  Do NOT buy this item ! I have never felt the need to write a bad review on a product .. The first one I got-the electric grid stopped working after a couple days . I took it back and exchanged for a second and the bulb burned out after about a month , replaced the bulb ( half as must as a whole new unit ) and then the electric grid on this one went out soon after . I never left it out in a strom . This product is junk !  
2	  I bought this device for my wife to use on her iPod nano ( 4g ) , and despite this particular iPod not being listed in the compatability statement , it works perfectly . I completely agree with the notion that one doesn't always want to run a computer all night simply to charge the iPod - and this device solves that problem with extreme convenience . I can now foresee situations where the iPod will get used beyond one battery charge that it previously would not , such as on any computerless getaway , car trip , camping , work , etc . I highly recommend this product as a solid performer at a good price .  
1	  Please be wary of the " good " reviews . They are people who just bought the product and haven't had much experience with it . I have experience with the product . I bought my player 4 months ago and loved it , at first . But this morning I too got the dreaded H03 error . And .. I can't do a darn thing about it . Normally , I 'd return it under warranty repair and pay my $ 90 . But , I 'm sitting in Iraq right now , without my receipt to " prove " when I purchased it . I can't even pick up the phone and call Panasonic because I 'll be on hold more than the 15 minutes I 'm allotted weekly , like I 'll use those precious phone calls for them versus my family . And I could pay the money and it still happen again in another 4 months while I 'm here .. So I 'm stuck with it - be aware , so it doesn't happen to you too . I 'm ordering another brand today and being done with it .. So Panasonic .. you 're messing with the troops now too ! And I 'm mad !  
2	  These HDMI cables are every bit as good as the ones going for $ 30-$35 . Don't let their low price fool or throw you . I compared the quality of the feed / signal going between my DirecTV HD box and Magnavox HD TV and they are the same . Well worth the price even with S / H.  
2	  Great speaker . The sound is as good as any hard-wired unit . I purchased two speakers , but found one was sufficient since we live relatively close to our neighbors and everyone is outside in the evening hours . I sold the other one to one of my neighbors when they heard the sound quality . Easy to set up .  
1	  First , there were a couple of good things about this player . I like that it charges on the computer . My first MP3 player ran on batteries . You can also put pictures on it . I really don't have a need to have pictures on my MP3 player , but it 's interesting if you want to carry some pictures around . This is what I don't like : 1 . The package said that a full charge would last around 15 hours , but mine did not seem to last nearly that long . I 've heard that having the volume on a high setting makes the battery go down faster , but I didn't have the volume set very high on mine . 2 . On your computer , you can't rename files or play them directly on from your player . If you want to rename a file , you have to copy it , paste it somewhere else , change the name there , then copy it again and move it back to the player . 3 . This player comes with earbuds . This isn't necessarily bad , but if you prefer earphones ( like me ) , you 'll have to get a pair from somewhere . I used the ones from my old MP3 player .  
2	  You know what you 're buying here . Works as advertised . I can take much longer exposures in day light thanks to this . Go ahead . Buy it .  
2	  I think very highly of the quality craftsmanship as well as the technological achievements present in this emergency AM / FM radio . It has the most efficient crank mechanism on the market and comes complete with an AC / DC adapter charger , a telescoping antenna , a large and good quality speaker , a single and bright LED flashlight , a separate LED for indicating the optimal charging crank-rate ( that also makes a decent night-light and also shows that external AC power is being supplied to the unit ) as well as a solar panel for both charging the internal batteries and also providing sufficient power to still operate the radio normally . The crank operates equally well using either a clockwise ( cw ) or a ccw rotation too so even if you forget , you can't damage it by turning the crank the wrong way ! As advertised , 30 seconds of cranking gives 35 minutes of medium volume listening ( or 25 minutes of loud volume levels ) and the listening time increases proportionally if you crank it even longer . The system is totally analog , lacks weatherband , shortwave , aircraft as well as TV bands . but is nonetheless quite useful as well as readily affordable if you wait for a sale . Freeplay also makes a much more expensive digital model with shortwave bands as well , but it is very hard to build all these as quality features including a digital PLL ( Phase locked loop ) synthesized radio for a reasonable price that people will also buy . My advice is too stick with a much simpler , quality made device that you know will work reliably in a pinch when it is really needed . One really nice feature for example is that the FM antenna can be simply stored in the radio when not being used , but when it is needed it can easily be fully extended . This also greatly reduces the chances of it being broken off inadvertently in an emergency situation in my opinion . The analog vernier dial is very easy to tune for both AM / FM and allows an extra large amount of turning to easily and precisely tune the am / fm bands . The volume control on the side controls all available bands . It also has a jack for a earphone / headphone during quiet times . Finally the provided charger can also be left plugged in indefinitely because after the first 24 hours of preconditioning the battery pack ( sealed internal Nickel Metal Hydride batteries ) , it will continue to keep them fully charged until the advent of an emergency by trickle charging ( by applying only very small amounts of current ) . In the meantime you can feel completely free to use it as an everyday quality and very enjoyable listening device . Most of all I like how totally reliable and redundant the many independent systems are on this radio . For camping and roughing it , it would have been better if Freeplay had provided a carrying strap for the radio ( to attach to the provided eyelet ) just for something to grab quickly , but for general household emergency purposes it is just fine . Of course you can always add your own strap if you feel that you require it for camping , etc . In a real emergency however you will be very glad to have purchased this quality instrument in my opinion . Finally I intend to buy several more of these units for my immediate and extended family members who really need this device .  
1	  I got an iRiver clix right when they first came out over the summer 2006 ( perhaps that was my problem ) . I really liked it , it was cute easy to use and I found an armband that I could get to take it to the gym with me . Within a week it stopped working . I got to the gym and went to turn it on and it wouldnt start or anything so I figured maybe I didnt charge it . I connected it to three different computers and nothing worked . I didnt understand because it had worked the day before and I never mistreated it or anything . I went back to the store and the swapped it out and gave me a new one . That one was working great and performing well until about 6 months later when it too did the exact same thing . This time I took it back to the store because I had purchased a 3 year extended warranty on it and was told that they would swap it out again . Well come to find out that store is no longer going to carry the iRiver Clix so they didnt have anymore in stock . I had to get another mp3 player of equal or lesser value , the choices were limited of course but what can you do . The player is nice , I liked that it played video and pictures and had a built in radio , something not all mp3 players are designed with . If it hadnt done the same thing to me twice I would have given this player 4 stars . Im not sure if it is some design flaw or what but it was extremely frustrating . If you do purchase the player I would suggest getting an extended warranty , just in case you run across a problem similar ( cause a 200 dollar mp3 player that dies in a matter of months and isnt covered would just be horrible , well at least on a student budget ) . Ok well thats my story , wanted to throw it out there since when I bought it it was new and no reviews .  
1	  I purchased these mounts for use with my Onkyo surround sound system because it was convenient that they were on Amazon and I could complete my order all together . Upon trying to use the " universal mount " system , I found that they didn't bolt up to my speaker system .. correct capscrews were not included . Further , if I tried to fit the capscrews I needed for my speakers , the counterbored holes in the " universal mounting " system were too small to accept the head of the bolt . I ended up going to K-mart and buying a " Universal mounting " system there that worked and did a great job . Maybe they work for other surround systems , but they don't for Onkyo .. not very " Universal " eh ?  
1	  As a scanner , it works fine , albeit a little slow for the hi-res scans , but what do you expect for < $ 300 ? On that score , I 'm satisfied . HOWEVER .. Here 's the rub . Every time I turn off the machine , I have to reload the software to get it to work the next time . Otherwise , all I get is a flashing green pilot light and a bunch of error messages from the software . The troubleshooting guide offers no help nor solace , and there is NO 800 NUMBER SO I CAN CALL MINOLTA ( ARRGH ! ) They say I 'm supposed to call my dealer ( AMAZON ! ? Are you kidding ) or distributor ( which they DON'T list ) GIVE ME A BREAK ! If anyone out there can help me , please send me an email . I 'M DESPERATE ! ( YOU HEAR THAT , MINOLTA ? )  
2	  works great to keep film safe during developing cycle . I bought it just in case the photo cages was a bit loose just to ensure a tight fit and it does fit very tightly .  
2	  The TV is huge . It works pretty well . The overall picture is not as impressive as I thought it would be though .  
1	  I bought this printer in March 2000 , that is , 16 months ago . About a month ago , after replacing the ink cartridges , I noticed that the black ink was streaking badly - so badly , that I can't use it to write cover letters or send out my resume . I followed instructions to clean the print head , with no improvement . On calling Brother , I was told the print head needs to be replaced . It turns out the print head costs $ 135 to $ 150 , and nearly everyone with this printer has had the same problem ! I can't believe it ; to have to pay this much money just 16 months after buying the printer is outrageous . Don't buy this piece of junk .  
1	  Product no Longer manufactures , no tech support . , or warranty by Kodak , no longer on the market . ir should not be sold  
2	  I bought this receiver when it was on sale for $ 280 . I also bought the Sony SA-VE367T 7.1-Channel Surround Speaker System to go along with it . Let me tell you , for the price this sounds great . I know there are systems that sound better , but you 're going to have to pay a whole lot more than this . Definately recommended !  
2	  Has worked as described and I 've had no problems with it . Very dependable .  
2	  The Nano is just what I wanted and needed . Mostly I utilize it for podcasts . I have had one problem of the Nano freezing and I have needed to " reboot " about 4 or 5 times . A bit annoying , but no true problem .  
1	  You have to disable ALL firewalls ( both Windows or any 3rd party firewalls ) to be able to install the server correctly . It shouldn't be necessary ( I remember several other software / hardware would just trigger firewall dialog automatically when they are installed , and you just click " Yes " or " Authorize " ) . You have to open some ports on your firewalls ( both TCP and UDP ) . Not too convenient in my opinion . Once it 's installed , it will see the attached device . For my case , I wanted to use Canon MF5550 ( multifunction Printer / Copier / Scanner / Fax ) . It detects as soon as I plugged it in , but when I install the drivers , it gives me a BSOD . Not sure whether it is my Windows , or my printer . But it sure is not pleasant . Eventually , I 'm unable to install the printer on my PC.I then tried to install the server and printer on my laptop . It installs fine now ( both the server and the printer ) . But the printer keeps saying " Offline " . Usually , I just need to unplug the printer and plug it back so it will be " Ready " . It doesn't work this time ( I have even also set the server to " Auto-connect " to the printer , still to no avail . Power off the printer and power it back on doesn't do anything as well . I guess it 's my printer .. So , my suggestion , if you have the same Canon Multifunction ( MF series ) , I 'm afraid it won't work with this server . Not sure with other multifunctions ..  
2	  My Nikon P500 camera indicates full charge until just before it is too low to work . A second battery was necessary to keep me from throwing my camera a long ways . I opted for name brand . It works fine . Now when my camera refuses to turn on , I just change batteries and take more pictures .  
1	  I purchased this item for my five year old son since he was always after my ipod . However , I don't believe this item to be easy to use at all . My music is imported on itunes and I could not convert the files to MP3 format . We also had a hard time trying to figure out how to use the buttons and features . The item has many features , but it takes some time to figure out . If you don't have MP3 or WAV files of music , I suggest sticking with the ipod . A shuffle costs about 79 bucks , but so much easier to use .  
2	  This Sony CD player is the first MP3 CD player I have ever owned , and it has suited me very well for the last six weeks . PROS - AWESOME battery life - 60-70 hours - NO Skipping - Jog Dial is excellent when it works - Good sound quality - Display shows useful information , you can edit this info in Musicmatch - Burning just MP3s is extremely simpleCONS - Feels sort of flimsy - No backlight on display - My jog dial worked well for a few weeks , but it started malfunctioning to the point of uselessness , and sometimes even became a hindrance when using the normal track selecting buttons . This was my biggest problem - Fairly unattractive design - You can't fast forward / rewind quickly through a track - ATRAC burning software is terribly designed and slow , and you lose some sound quality with that compressionBecause of the loss of sound quality and overall bad design of the burning suite , I only burned MP3 CDs , which still hold 150 + songs and don't lose sound quality . It was not a problem to me to carry around a few CDs , which could hold my whole collection ; however , it would probably be an annoyance to those with larger amounts of songs . To people who have over 1000 songs that they would like to carry around with them , I would suggest that they invest in a MP3 player . To everyone else , I reccomend this very good bargain CD player .  
2	  This charger is known to be the world most powerful and advance charger . Its very expensive but worth every single penny . Every rechargeable batteries of different brand ( Sanyo NiMH , GP NiCd ) that I have works fine with it . At first I had one the GP battery couldn't be charged up by my previous charger but Ansmann is powerful enough to bring this " dead " GP battery back to life and kickingIts comes with dual voltage ( 110-240V ) operation which means you can bring this charger to any part of the world and it still work fine , useful for people that travels a lot .. My previous charger can only work on 230V , I can't use it on countries running on 110V ! Great Product !  
1	  Like most technology , started out promising . Then , gradually got flakier and flakier . Usable distance was never more than 20 feet , USB connectivity for config was problematic under Windows 2000 / XP . Clueless ( although free ) phone technical support - got what I paid for there ..  
2	  Lately , ive had this obession with portable dvd players . I dont even need one , but they are just so COOL . Everytime i go to Best Buy , Circuit City , etc .. im always in the Car Section messing with the portable dvd players . Now , ive seen the best .. and ive seen the worst , so i can rate this dvd player with confidence . I was VERY skeptical about buying this DVD player , but what can i say .. im cheap , and dont wanna spend an arm and a leg getting something that will probably improve in 6 months anyways . Although .. I am extremely satisfied with this little dvd player . The quality of picture is about an 8/10 in my opinion . The battery only lasts for 3 hours and u have to charge it for 5 hours . Although i normally just plug it in an outlet anyways . You dont need batteries for the remote , which makes use much more convienent . The sound is excellent with or without headphones . 2 people can use their headphones at once , unlike many others that only have 1 slot for headphones . The design is OK . i dont like how the speakers are right under the screen , but i guess that doesnt really matter . Ive had this player for about 2 months now , and it hasnt skipped or froze even once . I actually enjoy watching movies on this little thing now more than on my computer on tv , just because i can move around . All i can say is that the price is great and is good for beginners b / c it resists alot of wear and tear ( very durable ) .  
2	  I had been looking around at Best buy and Target for an SD card for a week or so . When I saw how much they were going for on Amazon - less than half price , I could not believe it ! I ordered one right away and was thankful that best buy was out of the 4 GB cards the day I intended to buy , that were going for more ! The product came promptly and from then on , I tell every one about the great prices and the reliability of ordering on Amazon . com !  
1	  I bought this camera new , does not take clear pictures , took if back to the camera shop and they said it was ok . I do not use it , it does not take clear picutres . I wasted about $ 400.00 . Would not recommend . Yes you can drop it and put it in water but what good is it if it does not take good clear pictures ?  
2	  Durability - 5 out of 5Value - 5 out of 5Sound Quaility - 4 out of 5 if I don't consider the price . 5 out of 5 if I do . OVERALL - 5 out of 5I have had three pairs of these for over a year , with absolutely no trouble at all . Two of the pairs are mounted on the ceiling of my back porch . They don't get rained on , but they have been out there for two summers and one winter , and still perform as good as new . The other pair are on my kitchen counter . One is near the stove , and gets steam and grease on it all the time , but I 've never had a problem with any of them . If you 're looking for speakers for outdoor or other harsh enviroments , I hightly recommend these . If you 're on a very tight budget , they would even be acceptable as your main speakers , as long as you 're ok with the 25 W limitation .  
1	  these cartridges did not work well with my Canon printer . After a few pages of print they just stop working . I dont recommend this item .  
1	  I can confirm Mr Zinser 's review . I have a Dell 23 " LCD TV that weighs 23 pounds . The Omnimount documentation specifies that the mount works for this TV . But the TV immediately tilts all the way down . Omnimount had me tighten a few screws , which you could feel tighten the mechanism but not enough to support the TV . I would guess that Omnimount does not test all of the TVs that they claim work , but rather do it based on weight . It 's probably the distribution of weight that causes the problem rather than the gross weight . I would recommend looking at other suppliers , or at least make sure that you can return the product .  
1	  I used this on my 1500 watt straightener according to the directions and within 4 minutes there was smoke coming out of my straightener . This product is junk .  
2	  The ad was not clear that this screws onto the end of the factory zoom lens with a reducing adaptor but that was OK once I tried it out . It does fisheye and wide angle as you zoom . It shoots about 180 degrees from 1 foot away . Clear sharp images . Does not darken the image .  
1	  I bought a TIVO before Christmas . I spent about 2 hour with customer support ( 95 % time was on hold ) . Finally , set up was done and I could enjoy advertising free TV . But , no more than two weeks , I realized TIVO has the following 5 dark sides . 1 . Poor customer support , slow , poor training , and providing inconsistent information2 . Series 2 will become a " Dead Box " ( I 'm borrowing TIVO customer rep 's word ) after the trial period , if you don't want to pay $ 12.95 per month to subscribe TIVO services . Actually , you can get better service from Comcast for $ 9 per month . 3 . TIVO has no stand-by feature . The hard drive and fan constantly running which makes noise and costs more energy . The noise is not very loud , but it does bother me during the quiet period in a movie . I don't know how much it will cost me for for keeping fan and hard drive running in a whole year . The Stand-by is a matured , more than 30-year-old , technology . It has been used in almost all electronic today , even in low quality cheap products . I don't understand why TIVO does not implement stand-by . Dirty quick , low quality products and poor services could be TIVO 's approach . 4 . If you don't have a phone jack near your TV , you 'll have hard time to connect TIVO to your phone line . 5 . can't record for 40 hours .  
1	  After using for over a month the priter , - for reasons unknown - fails to print - advances 1 label & shows printer errors thereafter  
2	  Am a newcomer to the world of SLR photgraphy , and after researching a SLR for a few weeks , I had almost decided to buy a canon / nikon . Honestly , did not even consider pentax in my research , and just to see how the rebel and d50 looked and felt , I visited a ' camera store ' and asked the sales person for these models . I also asked her for her recommendations , and she sneaked in this lovely little camera . The pentax surprized me as a package . It was a delight to hold , felt perfect in my small hands and then after a couple of weeks of more research , where nobody complained about the picture quality or the quality of the product , I knew this was it . I will not go into the specifications as they can be found on a zillion websites and for sure this camera ' lacks ' certain features but which one doesnt unless you have $ or more . In the past two months , this camera has been to numerous hiking trips and I have always got great pictures back . It has ' survived ' a few raindrops as well occasionally when the clouds caught me unprepared with my backpack , but I would not recommend taking any chance with that . As a beginner , an SLR does have some initial learning curve involved and be prepared to ruin some shots if you forget to change the white balance , or other settings . I have just started using raw , and realized the advantages . Almost everything is good about the camera . But it does seem to underexpose a little on the auto modes . Also there are not many lenses made specifically for this camera by pentax unlike canon / nikon . I am not considering third party or older pentax lenses here . This might be a drawback . But I feel that unless you want to go professional , the choices are adequate . To sum this review , I feel this camera is a great entry level SLR which is easy to use , nicely built , delivers quality results an on a budget . I also got a couple of adobe photoshop manuals , which I feel is a wonderful tool along with my camera . Thank you !  
1	  I was really disappointed by the performance of these headphones . The amount of static it transmits is unbelievable . Even when I 'm just two feet away from the transmitter , I can hear noise and it doesn't even stay constant , it fluctuates which makes it impossible for you to mentally " tune out " the noise . Perhaps it 's because of all the electronic noise and appliances in my area , but that 's no excuse for bad reception at a distance of 2 feet . I wasn't expecting audiophile quality sound , but for $ 150 I definitely at least expect clear transmission within a six feet radius ! Also , whoever thought of putting the controls on the rear was obviously no genius . It 's impossible to lie down while wearing these headphones without messing up the volume and balance . Bottomline - Not worth the money - good features , bad implementation . Horrible reception unless you live in an extremely uncongested area !  
1	  I purchased this headset with the Panasonic cordless phones . I thought " same manufacturer , it 'll work great . " Wrong . The headset feels great . The mic stays close by my mouth without being intrusive , the speaker stays over my ear . You can even hear the person you 're talking to . The problem is there is a loud hum that is entirely too distracting to allow . I can't use the headset . So I have thrown my money down the toilet on this one . Sad , Panasonic usually makes quality products .  
1	  Fails to recognize archive , read-only and hidden file attributes . This messes up things like tape backup . It can only support one file system and it 's not NTFS . You can't defragment the drives so they are very fast out of the box , but keep on getting slower as time goes on . Probably good for a home user archiving data , but don't think about it for small business with several users that update files on a regular basis . Also can not be used in conjunction with a tape drive for performing incremental or differential backups due to the missing file flags . If you do decide to buy it suggest updating the firmware as soon as you open the box . Seems to have been a few speed improvements .  
1	  This product arrived very fast , but did not work for us . We are about 40 miles away from the Washington DC area . Perhaps it had to do with interference between us and the broadcast stations , but a cheap , old antenna did a much better job - so we switched back . Also , the product arrived with evidence inside that it had been opened and perhaps installed elsewhere before we received it . It was missing one connector plug for the little wings . Nothing looked broken , however .  
2	  Like other reviewers , there are things I 'd like to see changed on this product . However , the bottom line is that once you start a slide show , it works very well and has an excellent picture . For the price , this is a great digital frame . Most digital frames don't have internal memory so that is not an issue . SD cards are so cheap , who cares ? Many digital frames don't accept a USB device so that is a real plus for this unit . While it is true that grandma may have a little trouble figuring this out , I didn't buy it for grandma and anyone from the digital age could get this up and running w / o ever looking at the instructions . My only complaints are : 1 - The remote sensor is on the top behind the edge so remote functions must be done from above . 2 - I wish there were a few more choices for sideshow duration ( I 'd like to have a picture up for 5 or 10 minutes ) . All in all , I highly recommend this unit .  
2	  I 'm not an audiophile , but after a lot of research , I bought this system . For a little more money than most HTIBs you get a lot more sound . This system can rattle my house and also plays the subtle sounds you expect from a good surround system . The room I set up my system in is 20x30 , and I needed new speaker wires . If you use it in a big room , you 'll need longer wire .  
2	  This battery is in every way a replacement for the battery that came with my Olympus camera .  
1	  this was the worse purchase i have ever made and it was a gift to my best friend . It broke the third time she used it couldnt get it to read the cds not even after having it a week gravely disappointed . would definitely not endorse .  
1	  The light is a cute idea . The size is bigger than expected - about the size of the 1st three fingers of your hand put together . I got it for the recording capabilities , which are miserable . No matter how I tried ( quiet surroundings , close to my mouth , far away from my mouth , etc ) it sounded horribly muffled and distant . Super let down . Don't waste the $ .  
1	  I have two of the 605 30gb and the dvr recorder . They work great except if you wish to use the dvr recorder in combination with a motorola cable box - then the dvr does not work as described . This is a known problem discussed on other sites .  
1	  I ordered these headphones because my wife was tired of hearning me play PS3 games . I would have preferred a wifeless setup , but we are on a budget so I ordered these Sony headphones instead . They arrived and worked " Ok " but there defintely was some noticebale static when using the headphones . I didn't care too much at the time because , despite the static , the game audio came through the headphones and it didn't futher " piss " off the wife ( she could fall asleep without interuption ) . Fast forward about 9 months and the headphones just gave out . Doesn't work anymore . Junk product . I didn't even give it heavy use .. maybe 2x a month ! Plug the headphones in now and dead silence . Doesn't matter if it 's my notebook or TV . Dead . Garbage product .  
1	  I got the PC version of this drive , which comes with PCMCIA and USB cables . PC performance is erratic , but at least the thing works . But I cannot get this drive to work on my Mac . I 've got the correct cable , drivers and a new copy of Toast . Nothing . Forget support . I have sent many emails to Archos with no response . There is hardly any support information on their website . A company that does not support its products does not deserve our money .  
2	  I love the Flip Video Camera . I didn't have to read the directions to know how to use it ; that 's how simple to use this camera is .  
2	  I 'd never use any other kind of mouse . It took a few minutes to get used to , and I 've never looked back . Easier on the wrist , simple , no muss , no fuss .  
1	  NORMAL TYPING : Thankyou fr readig this review . this is nta tpo , thissanaccurat depictionof ow responsie the keysare onthe keyboard . HERE IS THE TRANSLATION : Thank you for reading this review . This is not a typo , this is an accurate depiction of how responsive the keys are on the keyboard . That second paragraph , and all the rest of this review , were extremely difficult . Making sure you are getting the letters you want to actually type out is much more difficult then it should be . The problem seems to be the sensor inside each key is just too small for he size of the key itself . I press a key and feel like it has accepted the letter , but the silicon contoured around the sensor and doesn't actually trigger the sensor . I feel this keyboard is going to train me to type as if I am texting on a cell phone - everything in shorthand . Not what I intended . Save yourself the headache and buy a more expensive one . And honestly now my finger tips are sore from pounding on this keyboard . So disappointed , Brady  
1	  I thought my 3 yr old TWC cable modem was malfunctioning cuz I sometimes got a slow connection . I ordered the Motorola SB5101 [ NEW , not refurbished ] because of all the 5 * reviews .. I should have paid more attention to the 1 * reviews . I connected the modem per instructions and .. nothing . I called TWC and the tech told me his system showed that my Motorola had tried connecting to the internet over 100 times and had failed about 90 times ! We tried the usual routine of power off / on the computer [ a brand new HP Pavillion ] and disconnect / reconnect / power on / off the modem . Even though all the lights on the modem were lit up .. I got nothing . I told the rep I was going to reconnect the old RCA DCM425 they had supplied me with . The TWC rep re-initialed the old modem on their side and I was back watching YouTube videos in about 2 minutes . I 'd look elsewhere .. such as buying it new from a bricks & mortar store . Lesson ? If it ain't broke don't fix it .  
1	  I 've just bought MR814V2 for a week . it was really good in the first 2 day . After that , it make the internet connection much slower . I tried to test by using command ping ww . google . com . With MR814 , both wired and wireless , the packet lost 30 % . When I tested my internet connection without MR814 , it worked perfectly with 0 % packet loss . Moreover , upgrading the newest fimrware doesn't help .  
2	  I look for and used many many other products of cat 5 and 6 cables and have found this item to easy to track this conductor colors , the jacket is easy to work with when preparing the cable to use . I would tell a friend that this is a good product to use .  
1	  I just returned it because it keeps disconnecting or going to sleep after 10-20 seconds of inactivity . I had to keep moving it for 2-5 seconds to wake it up every time . I tried everything from changing the battery to keep moving the receiver around it . The behaviour has no logic , sometimes works , most of the time doesn't . Cannot understand why .. I conected it to 2 desktops and 1 laptop . Exact same issues .. I own 2 Logitech Revolution MX ( Desktop equivalent of this ) and they work just fine . If anybody has similar issues then I 'd say return it . If not , maybe mine was defecive out of the box , which for such an expensive product is inexcusable so 1 star ..  
1	  JUST RECEIVED THIS ITEM , PAID FOR EXPEDITED SHIPPING SO I CAN SURPRISE A FRIEND AS AN EARLY GIFT . AFTER CAREFULLY UNPACKING EVERYTHING , I DISCOVERED NONE OF THE HARDWARE WAS INCLUDED IN THE SHIPPING . IT TOOK ME ANOTHER HALF HOUR TO REPACK EVERYTHING AND IM HIGHLY ANNOYED I HAVE TO TAKE MORE TIME OUT OF MY SCHEDULE TO RETURN THIS AND NOT GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING TO GIVE AS A GIFT NOW ! SINCERELY , DISAPPOINTED IN SUCH NEGLIGENCE CUSTOMER  
1	  I bought three of these cameras and the audio stopped working a week , the other two shortly . All of them stopped working the microphone . I do not recommend . Do not buy this camera !  
2	  This is the second 2gb ExtremeII card I own . I use this card in my Pentax K10D . Bottom line , it has a much quicker write & read rate then the SanDisk Ultra SD card . When I shoot a quick series of photographs I noticed how much more quickly the Pentax can write to the Extreme II 2gb writes compared to the Ultra 2gb card . I was so impressed that I purchased this card , my second , and have plans to purchase at least two more . In addition , this card comes with a photograph recovery program called RescuePro . If you have ever deleted photographs from your card by accident like one of my friends , you will be glad you have this software . I used it on her card and recover about 290 photographs out of 300 . That is a petty good percentage considering she thought that they were all gone for good .  
1	  I also made the mistake of buying this sorry piece of cr * p . My unit has had very little usage and is already broken . When I first purchased this , I had planned to use it in place of my older Toshiba progressive scan player , with the added benefit of being able to record . However , the picture quality on prerecorded ( i.e. manufactured ) DVD 's was very poor compared to the beautiful picture I was used to from my Toshiba player . So I put the Toshiba back and relegated this to my upstairs bedroom . I have a large number of recorded DVD 's of old Mystery Science Theater episodes . When I first started playing them with the Philips unit , I experienced no problems . Two months later , the unit now fails to read practically every recorded DVD that I try to load . Mind you , these discs have no flaws , play just fine on my PC-based DVD units , and USED TO WORK in the Philips unit . Add to that the fact that the flourescent front panel display has already started to flake out , and this unit probably has had less than 100 hours usage since I bought it . This is the first , and LAST Philips home entertainment product I will EVER purchase . A VERY EXPENSIVE MISTAKE . Avoid this junk , and buy Sony and Toshiba . You 've been warned . And when is Amazon going to come up with a ZERO stars rating ? To rate this product with even ONE star is giving it far too much credit .  
1	  The pot performed as advertised , but the taste was not at all as expected . Our old " on the burner " perculator produces fine coffee , but this automatic job doesn't cut it . Changed brands and amount of coffee to no avail . I believe the problem is that it boils the coffee too fast .  
1	  I am not the sort of person to be overly picky about picture or sound quality . All I ask is that it works ! And not only did this piece of junk die on me after only 5 months , but the Philips warranty and customer service are so terrible that I will never buy another Philips product again .  
2	  Besides Taiyo Yuden brand DVD media which are always highly rated . Verbatims are held in high regard . I have tried Sony , Maxell , Memorex , TDK .. all of the usual supects and Verbatims is my media of choice . I have gone through two 50 disk spindles and can't recall getting any errors . If you find a good price stock up on these . great buy .  
1	  This player is a complete piece of garbage . Not ready for prime-time , but it was still rushed to the market . While the picture quality is excellent ( when it successfully plays DVDs ) as you would expect with the HD-DVD format , it takes up to * 2 minutes * to load up a DVD and start playing it . Just performing a power-up boot takes at least a minute . In addition it does not play DVD + R discs . In many cases it would not play any disc you insert into it and required several reboots to play it correctly . I returned mine immediately and instead got a Denon 1080p-upconverting player and am happy with the picture quality . Bottom line : Toshiba 's HD DVD players are not yet ready for prime-time . Besides , with the annoying fact that there are 2 competing formats for hi-def DVD ( VHS vs Betamax all over again ) I am going to wait until HD-DVD or Blu-Ray is declared the winner .  
1	  We bought this dvd player in May of 2004 , used it 4 or 5 times . The sound is very low in the car so you must buy the ear phones . We pulled it out recently for a trip and the left hinge just broke ! We were very careful with this item and yet it broke and is out of warranty . Save your money and don't buy Polaroid DVD players .  
1	  Don't count on this piece of cheap junk to sound decent or work longer than a few days . I had a problem with it from day 1 , which was the middle of last month . First off it kept ejecting until I persisted pushing it back and and it stuck and played . It did play my MP3 for a while , but made a loud clicking noise ( after reading other reviews , I guess this was the gears ) that was loud enough to ruin what ever music you could hear . I only got it to work a few times , today it decided to not play at all . Every time I push it in , it ejects .. over and over and over .. I give up . Might try to send it back to Amazon , not sure if it 's worth it . Basicly I got what I paid for , a cheap piece of junk .. buyer beware and buy elsewhere .  
2	  Over-all this monitor has been pretty good . My first monitor was the Sound N Lights Monitor With Dual Receivers which cost twice as much as this one and it only picked up static and nothing else . I love the indicator lights and the glowing night-light . My biggest complaint is the batteries do not last long in the receivers . I only have the receivers on during the night and it seems like I 'm replacing the batteries every week ( and they are new batteries ) . The only time the receivers have " static fits " is when the batteries are getting low and the green light on the bottom turns yellow so you know what the problem is . Over-all this monitor is a good monitor and picks up everything that it needs to .  
2	  I found this product to be well worth the price . I use it with my 80 GB iPod video and feel much better about shoving it into my pocket or bookbag knowing that it won't get scratched up . The screen guard works well , adding protection without losing any image quality . Overall , a great product .  
2	  As if I needed more reason to watch TIVO and play video games . 6 months after purchasing the Bravia V-Series , I can't stop singing its praises . I have HD-Cable with DVR connected with red / blue / green inputs , an upscaling dvd player connecting to HDMI , and the a handful of other red / white / yellow connections . Pros : - Color and Clarity are exceptional-Sound is surprisingly good for built-in speakers-Channels and resolutions change with little delay-Effectively 180 degree viewable angle . ( I haven't measured , but everyone in the room gets a great picture ) - Loads of A / V inputs allow me to hook up all my toys at once . - Audio and video is customizable at each input allowing me to have one set of volume / color / contrast settings for my dvd player , and another for my video games . - Each input can be custom named in the menus . I don't have to remember what 's connected to " input6 " , I just select " Playstation " - Smart Zoom automatically expands low-def channels to fill the screen with minimal distortion . - Universal remote compatible . Cons : -I bought the mustang brackets whose hardware didn't exactly fit . ( Maybe I just couldn't figure it out ) But with some courage , everything got mounted . - Once wall-mounted , the 5 ( or so ) major inputs are inaccessible without bloodying your knuckles . I bought patch cables from radio shack to allow quick detaching of my playstation . Overall , this is a fantastic TV that is easy to use .  
2	  At first , I wasn't happy with the sound quality because it is totally different from the other products .. after a week .. I cannot get enough . The best product that I 've purchased ever . It feels like I have a Home theather system on my ears .. Strongly recommend it .. just be sure to use them for a week ;-)  
2	  My 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 has a RBQ radio which has a 6 disc CD changer . My girlfriend has XM in her Solstice and loves it and wanted to get me XM radio for my birthday . I was concerned about changing out the radio because it has some good features , including the CD changer . We went to Circuit City and found out about XMDirect . They didn't have the adapter for Chrysler / Dodge and said they couldn't order it because of the Sirius and XM merge , obviously XM isn't shipping any additional equipment to the stores until the merge is completed , but they did say that they would install it for $ 50 if we found a kit . We started searching online and most of the kits were $ 250 . We went to Ebay and found the complete kit for $ 49 . We received the kit and it was new , still sealed in the box . Took it to Circuit City and within 2 hours it was installed . Contacted XM online and put in the Radio ID that was on the box and bingo .. XM . You can also find the Radio ID on channel 1 on my radio . The RBQ still works exactly like it did before XM except that when you press mode it now includes XM . I like the way the radio continuously scrolls the song title , artist and channel on AM and FM stations but it doesn't do this on XM . It scrolls the song title once then goes back to the main screen which is a partial song title . You can press the tune button to scroll throught the title , artist , etc . This could be a limitation of XM and not the XMDirect unit because the Solstice doesn't scroll either .  
2	  I 'm not the world 's leading authority on powered speakers , but these are pretty darned good for close-up listening-that is , if you are using them as computer speakers . The sound has a lot of body and " dimensionality " ( for lack of a better word ) . They are a little wimpy if you are trying to fill a room with sound , but even for that , they are tolerable . Convenient to set up and use , and nice design . Only possible drawback in this regard is that they are not designed to be hung or mounted-only freestanding .  
2	  This is one very fast hard drive - MASSIVE over 750 GB has a 16mb cache and 7200 RPM - comes with a 5 year warranty - what more could you ask for ?  
2	  Unit did exactly what I wanted and freed up a big wire nest behind my equiptment .  
2	  I bought this frame for my mother-in-law to have with her so we could push photos of my daughter to her . This is done over the wi-fi , as kodak lets the frame pull photos from an online gallery that we can upload pictures to . Note however that I have seen this frame freeze up ( just while being on and doing its thing ) , and thus needing a power off power on cycle ( no need to unplug , as there is a switch ) . For the price , feature packed !  
1	  I purchased this fake verson of the Garmin adapter just in time for a road trip this is the worst piece of junk that I have ver purchased in my life , i should have listened to the other bad reviews .. But instead I was thinking that this wouldn't happen to me . This is a bootleg adapter you have to use it as a charger for the GPS in order to use it . 1st you have to completely charge your Garmin with this mess .. what a waste of time if your traveling . then only after its completely charged 30 miniutes or so can you use it . Dont give your money away like I did please go to the Garmin website and purchase the origional adapter instead of this bootleg model its only about 10 dollars more .  
1	  As the mother of a toddler , spending what little free time I have reading a good book is definitely a luxury . After careful selection and much anticipation , though , this book was nothing but a huge disappointment and a major waste of time ! It started out fine enough .. suspenseful and quite interesting . However , it didn't take long before I forgot all about the murdered brother entirely , and found myself lost in the monotonous details of completely insignificant things ( why DO we need to know the entire history of one cup ? ) . Oh , and the end ? Forget it ! I found myself flipping the pages , certain that there had to be something else that I missed . Was it too " deep " for me ? Did I somehow miss the meaning entirely ? I doubt it . I honestly think Ms . Tartt simply bored herself into some kind of writer 's block and decided to call it done . Ridiculous !  
2	  I 've used this camcorder for about three months now . Most of the shooting has been indoors - parties , babyshowers etc . The camcorder output when played on a TV screen is very sharp and shows lot of detail . I am impressed with the low light performance . Color is good , with pleasing skin tones . The sound quality captured by the onboard mic is not great , but adequate . I have uploaded a picure showing the camcorder on my palm . I was surprised that it is so small ( and light ) . Choosing this camcorder involved two compromises for me -1 . 1-CCD over 3-CCDI wanted a 3-CCD camera for more vivid colors , but a 3-CCD will have worse low-light performance . Since most of my shooting was going to be indoors , I decided to go the 1-CCD route . This camera has superb low light performance and I am happy with the colors as well . 2 . MiniDV over DVDMost of the newer camcorders write directly to DVDs . Some even write to built in hard disks . However , the technology is fairly new and involves early adopter problems . The hard disk camcorder is susceptible to shaking / movement , and it will likely be the first component to fail . The problem with DVD recording is that the format uses lossy compression ( meaning your raw camera output is compressed using an algorithm to DVD format ) . The MiniDV format , though old fashioned , is raw digital 1s and 0s - original uncompressed video data . So you can use the MiniDV takes as your high quality backup source to transfer the video to your computer . Then you can edit the video on your computer and transfer it to DVD . Of course , this assumes that you have the time and the patience to do video editing , but leave the door open on that possibility . Being a minimalist , I am against buying all kinds of bells and whistle accessories . However , it would be a good idea to get these two -1 . LCD screen protector . You will be using the LCD touch screen everytime you use the camcorder , so it makes sense to protect against smudges , scratches and dirt . Get the 2.7 " LCD screen protector on Ebay . It 's about $ 5 shipped . 2 . The provided NPFP50 battery is woefully inadequate . You will be constantly looking at the battery life indicator instead of concentrating on the subject . You need a backup battery anyway when you are shooting a special occasion . Get the NPFP90 battery . This is a fat battery that looks akward on the camcorder ; my wife remarked that it makes the camcorder look pregnant ( see my uploaded pic in the user images ) . However , it lasts for about 5 hours or so , so you can just plug it shoot as long as you want . The only negative so far that I have on this camcorder , is the vertical smearing that shows when you shoot against a bright light source ( a person standing against a window on a sunny day , or a bright light within a room ) . The image shows a vertical stripe that washes out the background . I searched the net and this seems to be a characteristic of the Sony HAD CCD . Nothing can be done about that , but it is a minor quibble . Good luck with your choice . P.S. I appreciate the film making process now after seeing the horrible quality of my home movies . The constant shake because of handheld movement makes the viewers sea sick ( inspite of optical stabilization ) . The best way to avoid it is to use a small tripod whenever possible . Also , in movies or TV newscasts , how many times does the camera zoom in and out ? The answer is never or very rarely , but with a camcorder everybody itches to zoom in and out constantly . This makes the video look very amateurish . I am now trying to edit the videos to make a slick and interesting presentation . This seems to be a whole new world . Very interesting though .  
2	  Received in good condition and delivery was very quick . The unit was easy to set up and easy to use . The picture quality was good and the price was right .  
2	  muy bueno el cable me funciono de lujo estoy contento con el envio ni mas ni menos espero seguir disfrutando de lo mejor  
1	  Constant paper jams that are very difficult to unjam , and watch out that you don't break the cheap plastic in trying to get the paper out of the roller . You virtually have to take the machine apart to get the paper , in shreds , out . The trap door in the rear of the machine , which you need to open to get those shreds of paper out , is EXTREMELY difficult to return to closed position , and the fragile plastic snaps on that are so breakable that I advise you taking the machine into a store for just this simple matter , which happens often . Aside from that , the Fax machine has too little memory , and tends to connect with a telephone line so fuzzy that the Fax sometimes doesn't go through . The directions are unclear as to which side of the page to feed your fax , so you can send an entire document of blank pages , and have to do it again , if you don't commit to memory which side of the page to face up before you send . Aside from that how much do I like this machine ? Not at all . It 's one good feature : it 's small and saves desk space . Don't buy it .  
1	  I was happy with the sound and design . Then one day the LED would not light up . Not a big problem ; I had had this problem before and read the manual to see how to reset . This time the reset did not work . Nothing I do will make it work right though it 's obviously getting power and was never dropped or anything . I wrote Oregon Scientific 's help desk twice and never received a reply . Bad customer service policy guys ! I guess I 'll have to phone now and likely they 'll have me ship it back etc .. Seems like a pain for a solution that may not work and a product that wasn't so expensive to begin with . I think the electronics must be very delicate . I had only used it for 2 months when it went kaput ! I can't say I trust them anymore ..  
1	  Fortunately , this product is " currently unavailable . " Should it ever become available again , do yourself a favor : avoid it . It looks like it might be a decent little iPod player that one could fold up and carry from home to work to vacation spots or whatever . If you were able to listen to it before buying it , you 'd realize that it 's just not good enough quality for any of these purposes . Tinny , weak sound . Way , way overpriced . Too bad I had to choose even a single star to rate it .  
2	  Highly satisfied with purchase and would definitely recommend buying from the buyer . Received the item as promised by the ad . Purchased arrived quickly and works wonders . I am very happy with the purchase .  
2	  Good product to have to complete my project that I had to do and with the color code it help me get it done quicker .  
1	  Do not buy this stuff It 's junk . I almost never write a review but I couldn't resist after using this junk . So , save your time & money  
2	  Overall comments - I have had this about 4 weeks . I am very happy with my decision , after reading other reviews and details , and then adding my experience factors of previous cameras , this was a terrific fit and I was not disappointed after having it and trying it out . whatever camera you buy , make sure what you want it to do , and what it is supposed to do are in sync . megapixels alone do not mean much . pros : - Image stability - read about it in other reports , but believe it ! works great , very happy I decided to pay more to get it , my wife has never quite understood the camera " squeeze " versus " snap " for shutter button . - auto options - the default built in works very well , but if you have some minor variations you want ( like ISO speed change ) , it easily keeps other settings and does the new ISO selection . just what one hopes for in a digital compact ' point and shoot ' camera . - size and weight - just a bit larger and heavier than small compact , but I still consider it compact . yes , carry in your pants or shirt pocket is fine . - eye viewfinder - ALSO chose this SC800 ( 2.5 inch screen ) over others with 3.0 inch screen , as it has the eye viewfinder without screen - terrific for those aging eyes that need glasses to see screen - you don't need the glasses with eye viewfinder , very convenient so many times , I mean who always has their reading glasses with them for picture taking ? and what good is another 0.5 inch screen , if you still don't have your glasses ? - good image resolution options , still cannot get RAW , but can change from 3 or more resolution images , and also change the compression mode for smaller file sizes , all with normal tradeoffs , but at least the options are there for the camera user to decide what is the need of the photo . - snappiness from button to image capture - once taking first picture , there is a pretty quick response on getting the images from button press , my other cameras have had such a long delay , i quite often got a picture that wasn't what I was trying for , especially if people moving around , etc , not in a pose . the first picture after turning camera on , sometimes has a longer delay , i have not yet figured out how to improve that all the time . cons : - the price was a bit more than I was hoping to pay , but after reading other reviews , it contained the features I wanted , since I have all ready had 3 other digitals , I am now a bit fussy . - none other worth mentioning .  
2	  Perfect combination for the desktop . The speaker works fine in a small room and the keyboard is perfect for controlling the media in XP or Vista . The only bad is the keyboard and it 's driver don't support Skype .  
1	  Simply put , I received the battery , charged it , installed it in my MD-10 and immediately my Nikon D700 battery charge indicator started blinking , while indicating no charge for the battery pack .  
1	  This is a very well equipped pocket PC that unfortunately has little or no support from Toshiba . The system ships with several significant bugs intact and no appearant plans for correcting them by the manufacturer . If supported , this would be a fantastic unit , but Toshiba seems to be focused on selling instead of supporting what they 've sold . The latest of issues with the PPC is the stated intention of Toshiba to not offer an upgrade to the new PPC 2003 OS . This is not just a ' nice to have ' feature with this item , it is a must have due to the inadequate support for wireless connectivity in version 2002 . The upgrade would go a long way to correcting many of the issues that the e740 has right now . I would not recommend this or any other Toshiba PDAs to friends or family due to their lack of customer support .  
2	  this is a great product for e-mailing videos or pictures to family and friends , but the only problem is keeping it up right ! The little stand falls over everytime you try to move it , so I just keep it on my desk instead of on the cpu . Great product , though .  
1	  This product is not worth it . While you are able to transfer files , it only allows you to pretty much only do that . Cannot use ActiveSync .  
1	  Before today I would have thought these neg . reviews were just bad luck or user neglect . Put me on the list too . The product was a dud . After a year and a half or very light use . ( 20GB of itunes music ) The hard drive was still working , the fw / usb board was " bad " according to acomdata tech support . I guess I should feel lucky that mine lasted as long as it did , and it wasn't the hard drive , but I don't . Just a waste of time and money . No more Acomdata for me . Fool me once , shame on you , fool me twice , shame on me .  
1	  Stay away from these earphones please ! They are not very good for any person who relishes audio in any way . I picked them because of good reviews by CNET and when I got them I was very disappointed with the quality . I gave them to wife , because she isn't as picky as I am , and within two months of use the bass completely stopped working in the left headphone . Not worth the money at all .  
2	  I travel quite a bit and most hotels just have wired ethernet in the rooms . This router allows me to connect my pc , macbook , and iPhone to the same connection with a box half 1.5 times the size of a book of matches .  
1	  I bought two of these for Christmas , and one would not charge at all , so I had to send it back . Looking at the various discussion boards , this seems to be a common problem . The other one charges OK , but only on the computer . It doesn't like the cheap USB charger I bought , even though my iPod works fine with it . This product has a lot of great features , and I hope that we get to enjoy them without any further problems . I would recommend charging this product before giving it to someone as a gift . Then , if it doesn't charge , you can send it back before disappointing someone .  
2	  This was my first ever lens purchase , if you don't count the stock lens that comes with your camera . I am only an average person looking to get some decent picture quality . I would not consider myself a photographer . I have a D3000 , so the auto focus does not work , but the manual focus is very easy . There is a small green light that comes on to tell you are in focus , so it makes the whole manual focus very easy . After 20 minutes of playing around with the lens , I quickly noticed such an improvement in my picture quality over the standard 18-55mm that came with my camera . The picture quality was vivid . I wish this was the lens they packaged with your camera from the factory . The size is small , and it is light . Perfect for having on your camera as a full time lens . It has inspired me to start learning how to shoot using more then just the auto or presets . I suggest it to anyone who is looking to improve you day to day picture quality as well as anyone looking to learn photography .  
1	  After a few months , the cord quits . If you 're using this for your car as I do every day ; this itemBelkin iPhone Mini Stereo Cable with Tie 3.5MM Stereo M / Mworks well in my 2008 Kia Spectra . I just hook up my smart phone to it and drive .  
1	  THis must be a mistake .. this is priced $ 170.00 over the $ 29.95 , full retail price direct from KODAK !  
2	  I 'm very happy with these headphones but they are a bit tight . I do have a large head ( 24 inch circumference ) . The padding is OK but they do not leave lots of room inside for ears . The sound is fine , there 's plenty of deep bass , they don't need to be driven very hard . But if you 're sensitive to tight headphones as I 've always been , you might want to consider something else . What - I don't know . I searched a lot for something in this price range that seemed like it might be comfortable  
1	  This is an addition to my review . This printer didn't last two years and died . I would use caution when buy further items from this manufacturer as I did't use it that much . Also , the ink will ' automatically ' go bad whether it 's out or not . I 'm told there are ' chips ' on the ink cartridge which only allow it to be use so long even if you haven't used them that much . Then they automatically say they 're out . I went from half full to ' out ' and barely ever used the color . Fine reproduction on this printer of photos w / photo paper is not the quality I expected , especially since that the reason why I bought it ! I told the Staples store salesperson ( which was probably my bad ) that I wanted a good all-in-printer , which it is . Later I was told ( months later ) that to get good photo reproduction one needs to use an actual photo printer for really good quality . Overall though , it 's a pretty good printer and for a couple of years I haven't had any issues with it . Much better than my Cannon that I bought a few years back for almost $ 500.00 and then it was worthless ( with no new driver available still ) when I upgraded to Windows XP . That was a real nail-biter !  
2	  This is a very nice camera with a very good zoom range . A tripod is recommended if available over the image stabilization modes provided . With a tripod , the image quality at both ends of the zoom range is great for prints to 8x10 or possibly larger . With a 4 Gb memory card , the camera will take over 1100 high resolution pictures or near half an hour of 20 fps XVGA video . White balance is OK , but for shooting backlight , snow , xmas lights , be sure to use the scenery modes rather than standard picture mode . However , the dynamic range is good enough you can salvage mis-shots with photoshop , etc . It would be nice if there were a cap available to cover the lens when stored . The battery life is nothing to write home about , and transferring files using usb or pict bridge seems to really drain the camera . Advise getting a spare battery and the optional DC power supply .  
1	  As had been plainly mentioned before in an earlier review ( which I misinterpreted when buying it ) , there is a caveat to this product , as confirmed by this unedited quote from D-Link 's own Tech Support website : " Note : The only Access Point the DWL-2000AP can be a Wireless Client to is another DWL-2000AP . " This means that it CANNOT be configured as a Wireless Client with your existing Wireless Router , even if your router is D-Link 's own ! It can only be used in this mode if , for example , you have directly connected a DWL-2000AP into your existing router to serve as your network 's Wireless Access Point . Then , and ONLY then , you can buy a 2nd DWL-2000AP and use it as a Wireless Client . This fact is not advertised in the device 's technical data page here , nor was it even specified on the box it came in ( thus my 2-star rating , mostly for false advertising ) . So beware this glaring shortcoming . If you 're looking for a simple , flexible , single wireless-G client to jack your Ethernet card-equipped device into , try a Linksys WGA54G . It is advertised as a game console adapter , but it actually works great as a basic wireless client for ANY Ethernet device , not just game consoles . I have one working quite well in this role elsewhere in my home using WEP , and will now be buying more of them .  
1	  I sent this back after 2 frustrating weeks .. I got this camera over the S50 due to the faster lens , larger optical zoom and the hotshoe , boy what a letdown . The autofocus is miserable , this camera needs full light to focus correctly and it is VERY slow , if shooting in dim light ( anything less than daylight ) this camera took at least 10 sec 's to focus , ofen it would just give an error beep and make me manually focus . Most flash photos were overexposed badly despite trying to deliberately underexpose . This camera is not worth the price , even if less than list . If you are willing to spend this kind of money spend a little more and get a digital SLR . I really don't want anyone to be dissapointed like I was , what a waste !  
1	  This could be my lack of knowledge about types of HDMI cables ( I didn't even know there were types ) , but this cord was all wrong for my needs . I bought it to use for my brand new panasonic 720 HD TV and playstation 3 . It didn't work at all . I got a newer cable as a gift that was only about 7 bucks and it worked perfectly , so I 'm not sure how much better it could have been than this one . So just beware .  
1	  I love this TV ! I own two 50 " , and one 42 " .. I was trying to order another 42 " . What I absolutely HATE is this company . Amazon claims there 's a glitch in their system which won't allow me to leave feedback for this company , so this is my only means of doing so . Here 's the story : First , understand that my wife and I have been Amazon customers for over 2 years . After 15 days of waiting , 9 phone calls to LCDMART , and 3 phone calls to Amazon , I finally cancelled the order for my plasma screen through Amazon . The SAME day I cancelled the order , I FINALLY received a call from LCDMART and the representative told me that I 'd receive my TV within 3 business days , and that he was emailing me a tracking number . He claimed that Amazon takes 10 business days to submit orders to his company .. from experience , I find that very hard to believe . I waited until the following day , and not having received my tracking number , I called yet again , and was told by John at LCDMART that he was emailing me a tracking number immediately . I did not receive it , so I called YET AGAIN , and was told that I would not receive a tracking number until the following day . I asked " How can I receive the TV by tomorrow if you don't have a tracking number today ? " I then asked when I would receive the TV . I was told , " I don't know . " I asked to cancel my order , and the representative for LCDMART said , " No . I can't cancel your order . " I repeat , he said , " NO ! " After a few choice words , and my persistent demand that my order be cancelled , he put me on hold , then told me my order was cancelled . This company is doing Amazon a great disservice , and is damaging its reputation . LCDMART did not return a single phone message , or email inquiry . I 'm sure LCDMART will find some reason to make me look like an unreasonable customer , but read the reviews .. I 'm not the first to experience this , and this " feedback bug " appears to have been in effect since 5/2007 , so NO feedback , negative or positive , has been submitted to this company since then . Buy the product , you 'll be happy . Just don't use LCDMART .  
2	  The radios are wonderful . They work just as described . We use them from vehicle to vehicle on our way and person to person while in place . They 're great .  
1	  Your Thinkpad will always * completely * drain the Ultrabay battery before going to the primary battery . This will dramatically reduce the lifespan of the battery . My Ultrabay battery dropped to 30 % capacity within 4 months , replaced it on warranty , and now is at 50 % capacity .  
2	  I built a high end desktop computer for a customer , and it didn't have a monitor port on the motherboard , but this fixed that perfectly . This card works great , but not intended for gaming unless you play pinball , and stuff like that .  
1	  Although the product works , it is known to cause major problems with streaming audio through your Microsoft Windows Media Player . I spoke with one of the Linksys tech support reps who told me their router does indeed cause this problem . After the infinite language problems I encountered with the tech ( Linksys farms out their tech support calls to a company in the Phillipines ) I was finally transfered to a " specialist " who was able to bring me to a " secret web site " to adjust my router settings . I 'll let you in on the address , it 's : $U$ . An " enter Network Password " dialogue box will pop-up . Ignore the User ID field . In the Password field enter the word " admin " . Then press okay . From here you can set your router . However , even after I was guided through the settings , my streaming audio still failed to work . WHAT EVER YOU DO , DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT .  
2	  So I got this camera like over two years ago and I feel like I can now make an accurate review of it . Don't let the negative reviews turn you away from this little gadget . Of course there are flaws to it and of course there are a few lemons in the batch .. just like with any other electronic products . I have not had any real problems with it . The only semi-problem is that sometimes the lens would not come out all the way and result in a semi-blurred picture . The remedy to that is just switching it off and back on again . No biggie .. and it rarely happens . It 's still working well and just a note .. if you decide to get the printer dock that goes along with it , it can still print pictures from the computer so even if the camera dies on you , you can still use the printer dock so I also suggest getting the printer dock because it prints awesome pictures .  
2	  It is a simple ribbon cable so what was expected was received . Not sure what else to write but there is a minimum character requirement .. enjoy  
1	  I purchased the Z22 about a year ago after my Tungsten expired . I loved the Tungsten but decided to go with the Z22 in order to save a few dollars . Unfortunately , I was very disappointed with this decision . Reliability is a major concern ; the unit periodically stopped working properly . The screen would go blank for a few days and resetting the unit would not remedy the problem . Eventually , the problem would fix itself . Also , the touch screen failed to properly work . Finally , after less than a year , it stopped holding a charge . I just purchased a Tungsten E2 and could not be happier . Upgrade and go for the E2 .  
1	  I have four of the outdoor units that are as good as a paperweight . At over $ 200 a piece , I 've wasted over $ 800 on these . Don't waste your money . I 've never wrote a review on any product before , and I 've bought a lot of things off of Amazon , but these are the worse items that I 've ever bought . Avoid at all cost .  
2	  The other reviewer is correct in that the DC portion of the cable is fairly short , which if you would need to use it any situation other than a desk it could be a problem . Otherwise , the usability and storage are good .  
1	  Great detail , etc .. Then the Ink clogs , the Ink blobs on the prints , etc .. Espon ? Ha they say end of lifeyea . Never again Epson .  
1	  After 6 hours , mine is only working as a wired adapter from the router to the stereo , but not as a ' wireless bridge ' . In wireless mode , sound is choppy and unacceptable . If you are a wireless network guru and must try this product , heed the advice in other reviews and dispose of the directions immediately ( especially if you have a router ) then expect frustration and disappointment for many hours . If you are expecting plug and play and are not a network wizard , I highly recommend another product .  
2	  This is a great price for a 6-foot Null Modem Serial cable ! I really needed this when serialing into another machine , and it really comes in handy ! Many high end rackable switches also need these to console in and administer them directly ! If you are in need of one , this is the one to get !  
1	  I am returning this item because it does not include a receiver . On the description of product line on the website it is listed as a receiver ( " Onkyo Digital 85 Watt Stereo Receiver " ) . My understanding , based on information on the website , was that it was both an amplifier and a receiver . Since I need a unit that performs both functions , I am returning it .  
2	  Not much to say , good price , high quality , picture looks great , didn't have to go to bestbuy and spend way too much money . Also twice as long as the ones at best buy , for about a quarter of the price .  
1	  The Good : Small , lightweight , inexpensivedecent soundThe Bad : The battery life on this thing is awful . In under two hours the thing is completey drained . This is made worse by the fact thateven when it 's " off " it still has an active display , furtherdraining the single AA batteryInterface is not intuitive ( then again what do you expect for something this small ) Headphones . Simply put , they stink . Those people with large ears may find them perfect though . Memory size is limited , and not upgradeable . Conclusion : The mini-yepp is an expensive , decent piece of equipment . Howeverit 's not worth the money . Its performance does not meet the specifications that are outlined in the product description and Iwould advise anyone looking for an mp3 player to avoid this modelunless they have money to burn .  
2	  Im not an electronics whiz at the least . Friend suggested this for a low cost dependable power supply to go with new video card , I installed both myself ! which is amazing .. Very simple does its job pushing new video card , 0 problems so far since purchase in june / 09  
2	  This logo visor really adds to the interior with a nice big red logo . I like the instant access to cds on the road . I 'll probably buy another .  
1	  I ordered it ( 1GHz ) NEW through " Electronic Express " . It had been repackaged into a container for a 2GHz splitter with Scotch tape . I don't know if it was used but it wasn't " new in box " ( See customer images ) . The ( 1GHz ) splitter I 'd been using for 10 years performs better ( doesn't pixelate ) so I switched back to it and will never use the Monster . It 's not cost effective to return it but it was $ well spent to verify the common theory that " Monster " gets a premium price for poor quality products . Amazon is awesome but Electronic Express has seen the last of my business .  
2	  First off , I have the current shipping version consisting of Hardware Version B1 and Firmware 2.00 . From day one this thing has ran like a champ providing a constant 130Mbps connection to my laptop . The unit itself runs super cool and isn't even warm to the touch ( I imagine this is due to the new hardware version ) . My only complaint is the USB port doesn't work to allow me to connect to my Buffalo USB hard drive . I can see the drive but cannot access it . Hopefully a new version of the Shareport from DLink will correct this . I can honestly say I am glad I didn't wasted any more time with Netgear or Linksys who seem not to be able to make a decent residential router .  
2	  I bought this item and simply plugged it into the parallel printer port on my printer and then into a USB port on my Dell Studio XPS 9000 running Windows 7 . Windows recognized the printer immediately and automatically installed the printer driver , without my having to do anything else . When I went to Devises and Printers on the Control Panel , my LaserJet 4 Plus showed up as a functional printer ( after a 30-second delay ) . I was then able to print a sample document . No fuss , no problems . After it was all installed , I noticed that it came with an instruction booklet and a little CD . I didn't need to use either .  
2	  Case Logic DCB-56 High Zoom Digital Camera Case ( Red ) I purchased this for my wife 's new small digital camera and it is perfect for what she needed . Just the right size and having two external zipped compartments where you can safely store camera memory cards .  
1	  I received a defective piece . So it didn't work at all . But regardless of that , I could just feel the cheap plastic material that its made off . It wouldn't have lasted much anyway . Returning it to the vendor .  
2	  This cassett player is nicely made , good sound , light weight . I could not be more pleased with it .  
1	  I bought these headphones because they had camo on them . I 've had them for about 6 months now , and they 've already fallen apart even though I rarely use them because of the shoddy construction and materials . The sound is merely OK compared to other full size headphones . Everyone that 's seen me with these headphones thought they looked nice though , and they keep your ears warm in the winter ( one of the reasons why I wear headphones outside in the winter instead of earbuds ) . But they 're broken now . DO NOT BUY .  
1	  I have tried two wireless routers to date with my IBM Thinkpad w / Centrino wireless . My first , the Linksys BEFW11S4 , never sustained a connection for longer than 30 seconds before dropping the connection , then re-establishing , then dropping , etc . Impossible to download large files , get booted off IM constantly , and took forever for simple websites to open . Linksys technical support even tried to dump me off to IBM technical support , but I just didn't buy it , considering my wireless connections have been fine elsewhere . I have also seen many websites offering this suggestion and that , tweaking the connection software , upgrading firmware , blah blah blah , but honestly , how hard does it have to be to get my wireless network up and running . The D-Link DI-614 + has since worked like a charm . Easy to setup . No dropped connections . Seems like it works fine with my Centrino .  
2	  Excellent device but the backup software is not very friendly . The instructions to use the program are nor clear enough  
2	  If you buy two of this your laptop could have 4Gb . I said " could " cause 32bit as Windows XP can manage total memory of 4Gb . If you have a video card that has 512Mb , then , despite you get 4Gb RAM , your computer will be able to manage only 3,5Gb . It 's worsty than you thinking now . You have the video card , mother board , etc .. I 've bought 4Gb and my Windows XP ( Toshiba P105-S921 ) only can manage 3Gb . It 's good anyway ! :) The price is very good by now ( 6/8/2007 ) . Sorry about the English ! I 'm brazilian ! :)  
1	  these headphones were great at first , but then failed ( right ear stopped working ) after 3 months . I sent the orginal pair back to the manufacturer for a replacement , but the replacement pair also failed with the same problem after a couple more months . Stay away from these .  
1	  This bag is smaller than the dimensions that were advertised when I ordered it so I returned it without a hassle and Amazon paid for the return shipping . It looks like the dimensions have been updated . My HP G72 17.3 " laptop did not fit , but it was close . Even if it had fit there would have been no space for anything else .  
1	  I faithfully used my prior Logitech Harmony 880 , and when it finally broke , I decided to upgrade to Logitechs 's flagship 1000 model ( which I have been using for several months ) . However , the new Harmony 1000 is so painful to use that I am seriously considering swallowing the $ 500 and buying another 880 ! I have had to dig out my original device remote controls , and once again have 3 different remotes littering the coffee table . My wife has given up , and completely refuse to use this thing anymore . Problems specific to the 1000 model : 1 . It uses ' beta ' software and crashes regularly . Adding salt to the wound , there is no reset switch , and you have to pry open a stubborn battery latch , remove and replace the battery , and then wait several minutes to reboot . 2 . The touch screen is cumbersome , it is not very customizable , and it is poorly laid out . The unintended result of streamlining this remote and removing the hard buttons is that it forces the user to navigate multiple menus just to get to the desired buttons . However , you cannot rearrange the screen to simply include you most frequently used commands , nor can you choose which set of buttons first pops up when you choose an activity . 3 . The touch screen forces you to actually look at the remote to find the buttons you want , like the guide or menu button . Also , the screen saver kicks in after a few minutes , and then forces you to first joggle the device to ' wake up ' so you can see the screen . 4 . The shape makes it very difficult to use with one hand ( and I have large but agile monkey hands ) . Those are my top complaints for the Harmony 1000 . I do still enjoy a good universal remote , but this is not the model to buy . Please note that it you happen do get a Logitech universal remote ( the 880 was fine ) , be prepared for a Lengthy set up process to get it correctly tweaked . It takes a long time for Logitech 's remotes to change settings , and tweaking your first remote for optimal efficiency can take an hour + .  
2	  It held up for two years with lots of abuse . I use it in a Fourth Order bandpass box sounds great . Plus you can't beat the price . Its definitely not the best , but works .  
2	  I really love this Hannspree Red Apple Televison . It completes the apple decor in my kitchen . The picture is unremarkable ! At first I was concerned the screen would be too small , but its perfect for any confined room . You will absolutely appreciate the decadence it adds to any room ! Amazon had this at the best price on line ! You won't be sorry if you hurry up and purchase this gem !  
2	  I went from $ 20 crappy speakers to $ 99 excellent speakers . I just plugged them in and the sound was awesome . I use it for iTunes on my desktop , and it sounds just like a stereo .  
2	  Just what I expected , the cord is stuff in it 's rolled up shape to a degree once you remove it from the pack . I suggest rolling it back up the opposite way and putting back in the box for a day or two to take care of that .  
1	  Do not buy this - time has passed this by . It 's cheap , because you can do so much more now than you could in 2006 . You simply cannot manipulate the videos you take on this - no USB connection to upload to a computer , no software to make changes if you could . Get a miniDV or something more modern . The miniDVD has passed . May it rest in piece .  
1	  After ordering and starting to install this cable I found that it was about 15 to 20 feet short . Since I all ready cut a couple of lengths I felt that I could not return it , but I did not think to check a spool before using it . So if your looking for and expecting 100 feet of cable check the length before using .  
2	  item works great , fits great , would just like it to be a little more durable looking , but seems to be pretty good so far  
2	  Averatec ( formally known as Sotec ) surely knows how to enter " slim notebook " market . - the price ^ ^ this laptop is a excellet buy for it 's price tag . similar slim note book for Sony or Fujisu cost almost double . After did some research , i'vd decided to try this laptop . ( i had Dell Inspiron before ) . It has been about 2 months , and here are Pros and Cons . Pros . 1 . Price - cant find any cheaper one with this price tag . 2 . Portability - Previous dell was okay but this one is only 4.3Lb . Here is a laptop that you can lift with one hand ^ ^ 3 . Performance - With AMD 2000 Mobile processor with Power Saving Mode . - not bad for games , internet , also for some video editing4 . Adjustable Video Memory - at CMOs , you can set you video memory vary from 8 - 64Mb . It is kind of cool . 5 . Wireless Lan - I 've been using it for a while , and the reception is excellent . Also it is Wireless G ( which is much faster than Wireless B ) 6 . Look for Rebates ( I purchased mine at Bestbuy with $ 200 Rebate , overall cost was $ 750 , not bad huh ? ) okay Here is some Cons1 . Keyboard - this is my most dislike about this laptop . It has been improved from previous one 3150 seris but still don't like the touchy feeling when i type my report . 2 . Battery Life - Avertatec claims it last up to 3 hours but i think it is more like 2 house or less . But it is still good compare to other laptops . 3 . Here comes the tricky part - the Power Setting for AMD process is rather wieird . Here is my recommandation for Power Setting * When you use your laptop with AC power , set it to " Laptop / notebook " * When you use your laptop without AC power set it to " Desktop / office " mode ( find this from Power Option in Control Pannel in Windows ) By doing this you can save battery life by minimizing CPU voltage use and FAN use . I tried other setting and it uses battery faster . ( talking about battery it cost only $ 99 to purchase extra one - other brand clost alomost double the price ) Here is my conclusion . I would recommand this notebook for anyone who is interested to purchase " slim Laptop " . Ah one more thing , their Customer Service is " Quick " when you call them they pick up less than 3 mins . However , here is what i found after talking to several of them , most of them don't have enough knowledge to help you out , even the simplest knowedge .  
1	  It sure fit well , but just does not hold a charge very long . It may be because the laptop is an older unity and uses more juice , but this one does not hold a charge as long as the original .  
1	  I too had all the problems mentioned with the Amp . Mine failed within the first year . I sent it back for service . It worked for a while and then failed again .. this time outside of warranty . It sounded good when it was working . I 'm considering purchasing an aftermarket amp from a 3rd party to get it running again . I wouldn't pay too much for one of these due to the frequent failure rate .  
2	  Functional , but not my favorite snagless design . The rubber half-boots over the cable ends interfeer with the removel of this cable . This is not a problem if you 're not taking the cable in and out like I do , or if you never have the cable in a tight connection like I do . There are better designs , like the ones with an additional piece of plastic covering the connection from the opposite direction .  
2	  " The case is better than expected . Many cases offered provided protection for the DVD player , but this case went one step further and provided pockets for DVD media ( a cut down sun visor CD holder works good in the center pocket along with the remote ) , the DVD player pocket is well padded with velcro straps to hold the player secure and ear phones work good in the outer pocket . The case has an adjustable shoulder strap as well as a case handle . Excellent choice for anyone ! "  
2	  I 'm using this in my basement with an older PC so that it will have internet wi-fi access and it works great !  
1	  This amazon replacement for Epson T009201 Color Cartridge was not usable in an Epson Photo1280 printer . Black came out brown and solid colors came out striped .  
1	  This has been a good product , but was not worth the [ money ] I paid for it . The color screen was okay , but then a colleague showed me his IIc screen , and then I was downright angry ! Palm blew it on the screen . It 's very marginal . The options for the SD cards are few and far between . There are book titles-but who is going to read a book on any Palm ? And , wireless connectivity has been VERY slow to come . Utilizing maps ( e.g. , RoadAtlas ) is almost futile with the small , low-resolution screen . I would not recommend the 505 and would suggest the following alternatives : 1 ) save your money and just get a Palm V , 2 ) if email is big for you try the i705 ( no color though-Palm must be scared ! ) , or 3 ) get an Ipaq . The future is pretty clear . Palm stock is WAY down over this last year and Ipaqs are spreading fast . Palm had a good niche market , but Microsoft reigns supreme with software and Comaq has a core competency in electronics manufacturing . Palm has neither .  
1	  I bought and Installed . I wanted to replace my 4 years old CompUsa G router with this N router . First I did the same setup as my old router My Internet worked with LAN connection . Wireless wise I had three laptop with G connection and two worked one dropped connection every few second . My VOIP phone did not work . I try to open the port through the setup for VOIP and did not work . I did research in the google and D-link site and look like many D-Link modem is having the same problem . I did my best to solve the problem and after two weeks I gave up and hooked up my old router all my Laptop and VOIP phone is working very well . I do not recommend this company router for any body .  
1	  My Infinity BU-120 sub-woofer is dead . The amplifier S53AMI blew and from what I have been able to learn on the web this is not an uncommon problem . Infinity can't help me since the company that manufactures the S53AMI is no longer in business . I hope Infinity has learned a good lesson but I 'm not going to buy from them or their parent company Harmon Kardon to find out .  
1	  Frustrating and difficult to set up with little to no documentation ( hard copy , on-line , and information on the CD ) . Working on it off and on it took me 2 weeks to set it up . Emailed the company for tech support and still haven't received a response . Doesn't appear to be supported by the company anymore . Had to figure it out myself . Worth paying the extra money to purchase a different brand that cost more , but easier to install . In fact , it cost me more in the long run if you factor in my time .  
1	  I would strongly recommened against buying this product . Some of the many things wrong with it : The player brags that you can fit 8 + hours of MP3s , or 16 + WMAs . Standard WMAs are larger files than MP3s . They use up significantly more space space in memory and therefore allow fewer hours , not magically double somehow . I quote 512MB in my review title because the actual file space free is about 485MB . The player has a tendency to shuffle songs in memory . I don't mean the shuffle feature simply turns itself on , no it simply saves the songs out of the order you specified . Which is okay ( though annoying ) for some music , but if you are trying to put soundtracks on ( for example .. the musical Wicked .. ) it 's very annoying when the songs are forcibly in the wrong order . Deleting and readding the files several ( 3 to 4 ) times corrects the problem . The player brags about easy file adding , how you can simply drag and drop to instantly add to the player . Not so much . Instead you have to work through either RealPlayer or Windows Media player ( neither of which are very agreeable ) to get the files to add . Then once they are added you can't do anything to modify them ( as you would be able to if it were truly a simple drag and drop system ) , so when there are glitches ( incorrect order for example ) they are impossible to fix without deleting all the files and trying again . And finally ( this is the problem that made me put the player back in it 's packaging 6 hours after purchasing it ) when I ripped and added music from one of my legally purchased CDs I got an error because apparently I had put protected music on the player , and it could therefore not play it . My reaction , " fine whatever , it doesn't have to be there . " However , when I tried to delete the files , the player refused . Insisting that these were protected files that could not possibly be modified or removed . 44.8 MB out of the already minimal " 512MB . " That is approximately 9 % of the advertised capacity of the player . Save yourself the trouble of returning it , and do not purchase this product . I will be returning mine in the morning .  
1	  I purchased this Rollei about 18 months ago as a replacement for an Olympus Zoom that I had enjoyed for several years . After many rolls of film the camera was stolen on a recent vacation , and I was almost glad ! The Scheider optics that the Rollei literature brags about did not translate into quality pictures . The contrast was low and flat , and the flash exposures were pitiful compared to the lost Olympus . The controls and settings were confusing and forced me to carry the manual for a long time in order to be sure I would know how to operate the camera and I never did master it . I have been a amatuer photographer for 30 years and own 2 Nikon FE bodies and an assortment of Nikon lenses . I understand the fundamentals of photography . The Olympus was purchased for my wife but I found myself using it quite a bit . It was much easier to use and the resulting photographs were better exposed and sharper than the Rollei Prego . One note to anyone that thinks that a long zoom is essential - keep in mind that at long zoom ranges the lense is at it 's slowest resulting more often than not in shots that are blurred because the camera cannot be held steady enough for the longer exposure . Consider a more moderate length zoom - 70 or maybe 80mm should be plenty without spending more for the opportunity of making unacceptable photos and consider the speed of the lense through the entire range of the zoom . One more thing - check out the reviews for the Olympus line of cameras and if you can live without a zoom , consider the Yashica T4 Super , too ! Goodluck .  
1	  Purchased this memory as a standard mico SD memory card and as it turns it not that standard afterall . This memory does not work with my LGcu500 phone . Called the people at kingston and they are aware of a problem on their side only said their engineers are working on it . No estimated time of fix , no replacement memory , the only thing they could offer it to return the memory for a refund .  
2	  This item was just what I needed for my new pc here and it is agreat product with a good price . ThanksJames  
2	  I really like the hardware itself , it works well . The software however isn't that great . When you can get good reception of a channel the picture looks fantastic . It does beat on the CPU pretty hard on a 2 GHz Athlon XP machine , so make sure your computer has the recommended horsepower to use it .  
2	  It 's amazing how many things use a ton of energy and how some use practically none . This is a must use item for energy savers . Only drawback is that information is lost when unplugged . Go for the next model up .  
1	  I have owned three SanDisk Sansa M240 models that store 1GB . The first one I purchased with a in store warranty , but the player did not work right out of the box . So I took It back and got a second Sansa which developed an intermittent short within two months causing sound quality to diminish significantly . I took the second Sansa back and cashed in my warranty on a third SanDisk Sansa m240 1GB along with buying a second in store warranty . In two months my third SanDisk Sansa m240 developed the same intermittent short . I 'll cash in my warranty on a different player this time .  
2	  This looks like an awesome mount . I just got mine . I 'm confident it will be easy to install ( I 'm a pro carpenter ) . It looks a little smaller than I thought it would , but it should work fine . Fully extended , it reaches out 14.5 " , which will still work fine for me . BE ADVISED : The LCS-KLA ( model number ) I received looked different from the one pictured on Amazon . I thought they sent the wrong one ( I went with the lowest price seller ) but I checked the model number on the peerless website peerlessindustries_dot_com and mine is the same specs and number as the one pictured here on Amazon . In fact , the one I got looks better than the one pictured . The price here is less than 1/2 what an equal mount costs elsewhere . Thanks amazon !  
1	  Great TV . Picture is awesome . Enjoyed it when it was working . Needed repairs at 15 months ( not under warranty ) Cost $ 700 . Needed repairs again for same issue at 18 months ( three months later ) . Another $ 700 projected . Decided to replace TV  
2	  I was originally going to buy a corded mouse for $ 15 at Best Buy because it was cheap but they ran out . The Best Buy guy said the V320 was the next lowest mouse they had at the time at $ 30 and that it was a great deal . I didn't want to pay double the price not to mention having to buy batteries for it when it died . But I was in dire need of a new mouse and decided to buy it anyways . I 'm glad I bought this mouse . The little micro reciever is great its small so its not in the way and it fits right into the mouse itself so I don't lose it when I pack it up . It doesn't waste as much battery as I thought it would . It says it lasts up to 6 months , I 've had it for around 3 now and it seems it will last 6 months . I love that you can program the scroll button click . I set it on my mac to open expose , its a great tool . I had nothing bad to say about this . I feel like a dummy but maybe it 'll help people . To install the batteries there 's a button on the underside of the mouse were the micro receiver goes , just push it and the cover pops out .  
2	  The low price almost made me think it was a cheap cable . At first it did not work but only because the port on my computer was too far recessed . After I easily cut back a bit of the jacket from one end of the cable everything worked just fine . In comparison , a 6 ' similar quality cable from Best Buy is $ 25 . I paid $ 6 for this cable from Amazon !  
1	  This product is complete junk and I will be returning this right away . The worst part is that it blew out my Yamaha A / V receiver and Monster Customer Service is a joke . They wanted me to send the product back to them so they could repair it and said there was no possible way it could have damaged my Yamaha . Now I have to have my Yamaha repaired at my expense . MONSTER HAS LOST MY BUSINESS FOREVER . STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF JUNK AND ALL MONSTER PRODUCTS .  
2	  This is supposed to be a special cleaning solution - is it really ? I can't say . I might just be buying into the hype , but after using it for years , I love the stuff and trust it . Have smudges , dust , dirt , fingerprints on your device ? This is the stuff you want . I bought the kit with the press-down spray cap ( it looks like there are several versions of the kits available - I can't comment on those ) . The kit does warn against not using it on certain devices ( and checking with the manual that they came with to see if you should use it or not ) . For what I needed it for : cleaning my LCD Monitor , Plasma TV and small devices ( iPhone , iPad , etc .. ) it works great . It doesn't have alcohol , so no need to worry about it eating the protective coatings . A spray is usually good enough for small devices ( more for a big TV ) - spray it directly into the included microfiber cloth ( not onto the TV ) . Not only does it work , it works FAST . You can scrub at an iPhone screen for a couple minutes with a dry microfiber cloth and it 'll clean it - with the ScreenClean kit , you only need to wipe it 1-2 times and you 're done . The bottle mine came with ( 6.76 oz ) is enough to last a long time . I 've had mine for about 3-4 years and still have about 3/4ths of it left . I was surprised to see this was a MONSTER product , considering how inexpensive it was . Is this a necessity ? No . You can probably get by with water and a microfiber , but this will make the process much quicker ( and easier ) , and for that it was definitely worth the ( low ) cost .  
2	  These perform just as good as the more expensive name brand cables for a fraction of the price a great buy .  
1	  I bought this for my S51 camera thinking it would power the camera and also charge its battery ( when the battery is normally inserted in the camera ) . It does not charge the battery of my S51 . I need to contact Nikon to inquire about this , but if you want an AC adaptor that will also charge the battery , then do not buy this one .  
1	  I purchased this set from BJ 's and it was dead out of the box . The service dept is totaly worthless . No way to expedite a repair even for a brand new product ! could take 5-7 days for parts . Can't bring it back because the box gets destroyed by there directions to get the set out . I will NEVER buy another Philips ANYTHING ever again .  
1	  Samsung Maxima 105 GL QD Zoom Date 35mm CameraThe order was diff . than it is shown , Camera dose not function at all , the camera is has marks all over , it is very old . seller dose not respond at all to the emails . I give it a 0 for services , and item the sold  
2	  I just returned from a 2-week snorkeling trip to the Society Islands ( Tahiti , Moorea , Bora Bora , etc . ) and used this UW housing for the first time . It worked perfectly . I was hesitant at first to pay the $ 200 + price , and even checked out an incredibly inferior $ 30 waterproof bag-type housing . In retrospect , I 'm very happy I " took the plunge " and bought this product , particularly in light of the thousands of bucks my trip cost . As advertised , all of the controls are accessible , which is wonderful when quickly shifting between UW mode to Intelligent ISO when you pop above the surface , or between static and video to catch that ray or reef shark ambling by . I was careful to read the manual first and follow directions and never had a single problem after 25-30 short dives . Picture quality varied due to lighting , water clarity , and use of flash . The camera 's UW setting sometimes yielded much better results than without . Post-dive Photoshop treatment really helped with final images , which probably tells you more about my amateur photography skills than anything else . Highly recommended .  
1	  The sound quality is good and the noise reduction is great , but I can't wear these for more than twenty minutes without getting a headache from it squeezing my head too tight . I don't even have a big head .  
1	  Purchased a new Artixscan 1800f last January . I suspect that it was defective , since I had problems with the lamps from the beginning . Due to my very intense work schedule , I was unable to arrange for warranty service until last week . Microtek would not honor the warranty but wanted $ 400 to swap the unit for a refurbished one . Granted they would pay shipping , but , honestly , is it worth the price and is this the kind of service consideration one expects from a so-called " high-end " company . I am buying a new Epson in hopes that they will provide some latitude and discretionary consideration for this kind of expensive equipment .  
2	  I agree with the other review that this is underappreciated . I did not get the remote to work and FM didn't work on mine either , but the video works well . The built-in software works , but doesn't work for digital TV ( Over-the-air TV in the US ) . I connect my digital converter box to the RCA jack ( yellow ) and the picture is quite good . The included drivers worked fine . Install dscaler as well , as that software gives better control of the card 's features .  
1	  I bought mine used and the original owner didn't tell me that the thing was a lemon . It doesn't hold a charge for longer than 2 minutes sometimes , even after charging for hours . The one I got must have a short-circuit in it or something . They 're also like 2.5 " x 4 " x 1 " thick so it 's a bit bulkier than I expected . But I mean .. way less bulky than a tape or cd player so hey !  
2	  I dont have nothing bad to say about this product . I bought two of them and installed them in my friends cars . These work great and are cheap .  
1	  This thing works great if you ever get it set up right . The start activity ( arguably a very very important step ) is horrible if you want to modify it . I had to delete a device in an activity and then reinstall it to change start up activity . I needed to change the settings on the receiver and the tv for roku box . Good luck . It is great if your are very electronically technical BUT if you are not , get ready for some choice works . Help is extensive , not that helpful .  
2	  This is my first MP3 player , but I must say that I love it . I have had no problems with it so far . The 80-gig model , the one I have , is more than enough for my whole library of music . I only wish that I could shuffle songs in a playlist , but que sera .  
1	  I got my com switch hoping to finally be able to use my fax without a bunch of messing around . Not the case . The switch does not work as advertised . I spent hours trying different configurations with no luck . My business partner has the same switch and his works fine . The company no longer exists to support it . I don't know if my unit is defective or just a rip off . Dont waste your time and money like i did . I am out the ~ $ 250 I spent .  
1	  Honestly , you get what you pay for . From the minute I got this thing in the mail , I loaded it up with music , put new batteries in and was ready to go . Unfortunatly , the device was not . I had to keep playing with the battery to get it to turn on . When it did finally turn on , I listened for a bit and put it on pause .. when I did that , it shut off and once again , I was playing with the battery to get it to work . I 've tried Energizer Lithium batteries and Duracell thinking maybe it was the battery but sad to say , it wasn't . Like I said , you get what you pay for .. what do you expect for 20 bucks ? lol . When it wants to work , it is great .. but those with little or no patience are urged to stay away from this device .  
2	  This router is just what our office needed for our computer networking . It was easy to install and works well . The exact same router was advertised at Staples for $ 45.00 more . This was a good purchase for us .  
2	  Holy smokes I only paid $ 49 for this thing after rebates and it was worth a lot more . It is quiet , fast , prints on both sides of the paper , has two paper trays , and seperate less expensive ink tanks . I like the screen monitor that pops up showing the print progress and graphic representations of the ink remaining in each tank . I also have two HP printers in the house but the single color cartridges are SO expensive and if you run out of one color you have to replace the whole color cartridge . This has now become our primary printer and it just does a great job . It sure is handy to have 8 x 10 sheets in the top feeder and 4 x 6 glossy photo stock in the lower cassette feeder . I can print without changing paper type from anywhere in the house . I use this printer for normal 8 x 10 hardcopy , and for quick access photos . However my bulk photo printouts still go to CostCo where the quality is still better than the printer , and the cost is less . CostCo only charges $ 0.17 for 4 x 6 prints and by my calculation they cost over $ 0.22 on the PIXMA ip3000 .  
2	  Bought this for my husband for his birthday . Great starter bag for those getting into photography . Holds the camera base and 2-3 lenses . Also has many different pocket areas for batteries , memory cards , cords , etc . Durable and pleased with the purchase .  
1	  The problem with this hub is that it has horrible latency . If you 're planning on plugging a thumb drive or external hard drive into this , forget it . If you 're trying to run a keyboard & mouse , it 'll probably work fine . Go from the point of view that anything with an extremely low data rate will work just fine , but anything else is going to have major issues .  
2	  I was skeptical when I purchased this product . Now after using it for several months , I would consider it a perfect enhancement to my workstation configuration ( iow : laptop , docking station [ attached to monitor , keyboard , mice and attached storage device ] and MoGo Mouse ) . Others at work are jealous that I do not have juggle an external mice when taking my laptop to a long meeting . Also , I do not have a USB transmitter / reciever sticking out the side of my laptop like other co-workers have . Utilizing the built-in bluetooth capabilities of my laptop , the MoGo Mouse is a perfect fit with work style . I 'll be getting these mice for each one of my staff .  
2	  The MVC-CD400 is a new model of Sony 's established mini-CD burning cameras , along with the MVC-CD250 , replacing the CD200 and CD300 models . So why would Sony need to upgrade anything you ask ? I was actually asking myself the same thing at first . I was getting ready to drop down the money for a CD300 model when I heard a new design was coming out , so I started doing some research . I found that Sony has done a nice job of directly addressing many of the failings of the CD300 / CD200 units , and added some especially nice touches to boot ! The most noticeable change up front is that the built-in flash unit has moved from the upper right side of the unit to right over the barrel . This helps with avoiding shadow effects when taking up-close shots . Additionally , they have addressed the single most commented-upon flaw of the 200/300 series : Viewing the LCD screen in bright sunlit conditions . They have added a clear ' strip ' along the top of the LCD panel that allows ambient light to help back-light the LCD screen , and the results are frankly good , making the LCD significant more usable in all lighting conditions without having to buy the ' viewfinder attachment ' that Sony sells for the Mavica CD model cameras . The third significant change is the addition of a standard flash adapter , allowing one to use external flash units with this camera for better lighting when needed . It is important to note - apparently it is critical to make sure you use a normal low voltage external flash instead of a studio-quality high-voltage unit , as this may damage the camera ! Like it 's previous generation brothers , the CD400 includes a Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar lens for high quality ( professional ? ) photography without the distortions you may sometimes find in the ' corners ' of shots taken through some lower quality digital cameras . It also upgrades the CCD from 3.3 megapixels to 4.0 or so , which means even more detail can be captured for folks who are interested in capturing everything possible . The other unique addition is Sony 's Hologram AF system , which uses a laser emitting diode to put a crosshatch pattern on your target prior to snapping the shot , letting the autofocus get better accuracy when dealing with situations that sometimes confuse traditional autofocus routines . Sony 's batteries also are decent , giving a typical user 2 + hours of uninterrupted shooting before needing replacement , and then recharging in ~ 45 minutes . And of course the mail selling feature for most folks , myself included - the photos are saved on mini-CDs , rather than one of the various memory stick / card units . Mini-CDs are dirt cheap per MB compared to memory sticks , and typically store ~ 150-200MB worth of photos , depending on make . Sony of course recommends you use only their branded disks , but many folks are reporting no problems using other manufactured brands . Depending on CD used , this translates into ~ 10 photos at the absolute maximum resolution 2272x1704 at maximum quality ( TIFF ) through ~ 1300 + photos at 640x480 at standard quality ( JPG ) . As an added feature , you can record movies with audio with the camera also , though the image and sound quality are not comparable with a digital video camera so if video is your passion , go look for a video camera , not a digital still camera . Otherwise , this is a nice little bonus . I had resisted the urge to purchase a digital camera for a long time , waiting both for the photo quality to start approaching that which could be found with 35mm cameras , and for the means to get the pictures into a usable format on the PC to become cheaper or easier . Mini-CDs work in nearly all modern CD drives on computers , and I have not run across one yet that failed to work , though I admittedly tend to have relatively modern equipment at home and work . ( Nothing older than ~ 3 years old at least in terms of CD drives . ) The MVC-CD400 is an answer to every criticism I 've had about digital cameras for the last few years . I 'm enjoying mine greatly ! ONE NOTE : Viewing ' unfinazlied ' CDs on a Windows PC only works if you have DirectCD installed , which is an application that comes bundled with pretty much any CD burner on the market . ' Finalized ' CDs are readable pretty much everywhere .  
1	  Hey I just bought this keyboard and mouse combo . The box , CD and manual says Windows 98 and later . It installed OK , and it went to the web to get the latest version of the software / drivers . Upon restart however nothing worked from the Kensington keyboard or mouse or the inbuilt keyboard and trackpad on my laptop - alarm bells ringing at this point . Nothing when I hooked up my trusty old USB keyboard and mouse despite several hard-restarts . No response on Kensington 's tech support " Please call back etc etc " Their website makes no mention of this item / combo - so I couldn't even download a separate installer for it . I had to F8 & boot up from a previous restore point . As a result it gets no votes - wouldn't work ! Vista users you have been warned . I have used tons of legacy gear through my work which only comes or has available Win98 drivers and they have all worked thus far - this wireless desktop being the exception .  
2	  This hood is bundled with the canon 24-70mm f / 2.8L lens . The only reason to purchase it by itself is if you bought a used lens that did not come with a hood or you 're replacing a missing / damaged hood . As with most things made by Canon for their excellent line of digital SLRs , this product is very well made , albeit a tad expensive . The hood blocks direct sunlight admirably and the felt material inside diffuses any remaining bounce light . The only problem I 've found in using it is that the end of the 24-70 f / 2.8L lens telescopes out , thus reducing the hood 's effectiveness for wide angle shots . Fully extended at 24mm , the hood offers the 24-70mm f / 2.8L lens less than 1 inch of cover on the sides . This is not a problem with the hood itself , but it does appear to be a minor design oversight in the lens . Despite this single drawback it 's an excellent product .  
1	  ( This review applies to the JVC 30-disc DVD-R spindle , Taiwan , 4.7GB , model no . VD-R47 GU 30 , Version 2.1/16x ) These JVC discs are manufactured in Taiwan and are of very poor quality . No fewer than twelve of the thirty discs ended up in my recycle bin because they were unusable , so my net cost per disc was no bargain at all . After going through this 30-count spindle very quickly due to the many duds , I drove to my local retailer and bought a 50-count spindle of Sony DVD-R discs ( manufactured in Malaysia ) for $ 19 . The contrast couldn't be more dramatic : The Sony discs have burned error-free thus far . This JVC 30-ct spindle may seem like a good deal at first , but you 're going to end up with many , many coasters . Buyers beware .  
1	  This hairdryer was my favorite one until it mysteriously stopped working one day for no reason . When it did work , it dried my hair ( thick & wavy ) in about 5 minutes ! I also loved the retractable cord . When unfolded , this is a full size hairdryer and it is weighty which I liked about it . However , it won't turn on less than 1 year after I got it . I have had previous hair dryers for years with no problems . This is not an expensive hair dryer so it was great while it lasted . I am giving it two stars because it didn't last . ( while it worked , I 'd give it a 5 )  
1	  This salad shooter thing was terrible ! I tried it and it took me longer to make the salad with that then it would have without it . You can only cut certain types of vegetables and fruit and 1/2 of what you cut gets stuck inside the machine . When I went to clean it , 1/2 my salad was in the machine and was wasted . It also made a funny burning smell when I put something in to cut . I would not suggest this to anyone . If you didn't return it you would put it in the back of a closet and throw out in a few years .  
1	  This device gave me a BSOD ( blue screen of death ) . When I ran whocrashed to read the dump file the error was MULTIPLE_IRP_COMPLETE_REQUESTS file path : C :\ windows\system32\drivers\ser2pl64 . sys product : Prolific USB-to-Serial Bridge Cable . So I uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers and now it seems stable enough . I did need to unplug the usb port and re-seat the cable once when my console froze and plug it back in to restore console connectivity . Bottom line is I was able to get it to work atleast once but I don't know if I can trust this device to work consistently .  
2	  This is a nice and long cable . It works very well with my HDTV . I have a nice , clear picture . It is inexpensive . However , I do not recommend using this for a console game , such as a PS3 . I get a lot of lines when I try and use this with a PS3 . It is not usable in that regard . For the HDTV , connected to Cable TV , it works just fine .  
1	  ALL Seagate hard drives encased in the enclosure pictured here , regardless of the capacity , eventually will suffer from OVEARHEATING due to restricted airflow caused by too many wrappings around the electronic circuitry of both the hard drive and the controller board , which in turn will cause the HD to make noises and die . I purchased a 400Gb HD less than 2yrs ago , and it 's already dead . To be able to get the data out , I had to PEEL the hard drive from the superfluous plastic and metal wrappings , connect the drive practically NAKED , to avoid overheating , sometimes with a fan blowing on the drive so that , little by little , the data came out . After that , I threw it away . It 's a shame that , of all people , Seagate should know that HDs overheat , so I don't understand why they chose to design an enclosure that allows a very minimal airflow , and to make matters worse , without the help of at least a small fan to pull the hot air out and improve the deficient cooling of this unit . Don't buy any unit encased in this enclosure . You 'll regret it down the road . Buy one with at least a fan to keep it ALWAYS cool .  
1	  If you 're looking for an affordable way to test out a digital camera , this is a good place to start . This very portable camera ( about the size of a credit card ) does perform the basic tasks . The software program is fairly simple , and if you are computer literate , you will have little trouble navigating it . Outdoor shots are better suited to this product , although with good indoor light a quality photo can be achieved . Enough pixels to e-mail a decent photo . Overall , a good starter camera for the money .  
2	  Not an audiofile but these sound great ! they leak sound like crazy though . Perfect for at home listening but not really the best for listening out and about .  
1	  Pro - Easy install . Pro - Increased the number of bars from 3 to 3/4 . Con - According to speedtest - my download speeds decreased after install . Prior to install > 10Mps . After install 5-7 Mps . I repeated the experiment several times . Odd . Anyway - I guess I am now stuck trying to sell this thing .  
2	  I bought this for my husband and he really likes it . The recordings are crystal clear . Great product overall .  
1	  Do NOT BUY this product if you plan on using it in France ! We charged the product and tested it in the U.S. and it seemed to work fine . We specifically got it for our trip to France . We get to Paris , turn it on , it loads up to 43 % and then says it does not have enough memory to work . We tried it twice more and the same thing happened . I have no idea if the same thing would happen in other European countries since we only tried it in France . I hope this review helps those from making the same mistake we did .  
1	  It didn't work on my computer , but it works on my aunt computer . I was going to send it back to amazon , I decided to sell it to my aunt since it looks very nice .  
2	  Great product to get the best out of your shuffle .. if you dont mind looking a bit strange .. the advanatage of no wires overcomes the looks part .. great when you jog and .. BUT you need to be ever so GENTLE .. lot and lots of tender loving care in handling it . needed as it is somewhat fragile .. but that care will give you dividends .. great sound .  
1	  It does not receive or send the correct messages to our Olevia Television . The model of our Olevia is 255T FHD . Is there anything you can do to resolve this problem ? Would appreciate a response . Thank you .  
1	  These are not what I expected based on the reviews I read & price paid . They are on the flimsy side IMO & do not sound any better than most other cheaper & flimsy headphones I 've tried . If I had to do it over again & would have spent more & bought some Grados .  
2	  i got it for $ 1.61 and i use it for my xbox so that i don't have to use the input form my cable box and have to switch the cable back and forth whenever i 'm done . for my purposes 6 feet was defiantly enough as well  
2	  With the transition to digital broadcasting on 2/17/09 I purchased a Panasonic VCR / DVD recorder combo and connected it to my Panasonic plasma TV with these cables . I had not made such a connection before and I wanted to have cables that would work right the first time and be worry-free thereafter . I purchased these cables because they were suggested by Amazon and because they received strong reviews from previous purchasers . I was not disappointed as they have performed just as advertised ! You can spend more , but you can't buy better .  
1	  I wish someone had wrote this review before I had bought my Rio carbon ( 2 for that matter . ) I purchased my Rio carbon around Xmas of 2004 . Having used it for almost a year with no complaints I dropped it . Im not a clumsy person but using it everyday scrolling between songs after song It would move in and out my pocket repeatedly . As you can guess the volume and song scroll wheel got jammed in . This delicate piece does not take much effort to destroy . So I decided to be extremely careful and buy the Rio carbon pearl ( 6GB ) . Again it worked perfectly for a little bit over a year and then suddenly it didn't work . After restarting the unit more than a dozen times it worked again but did not read the songs I had on the mp3 . Rio customer service said they did not know what was wrong , but I had another 2 or 3 Mb of storage left . Now 2 months later my Rio completely kunked out and I never drop the unit once ! I hate Apple and ipod because everybody had one and I didn't want pay more for an ipod mini which at the time had less storage space for around the same price . But now I know why people pay more for things : Qaulity . A brand new Rio carbon cost 114 dollars now as listed on Amazon ; but if you are ok with it having problems within a year , then this is the mp3 4 u .  
1	  I have yet to install this item . Will get back to you as soon as I do  
1	  This " LCD " is a hunk of junk . Along with everyone else , my screen is also slowly being replaced by a large blue stripe . I will never purchase another Zenith product again , especially considering how much I paid for it . My " 3 year " bulb didn't last that long and was expensive to replace . On the other hand , my Sony 57 " XBR rear projection is still working perfectly after 8 years and hasn't required any service at all . I 'm going with Sony next time .  
2	  arrived as described , faster than expected . no problems , works as it should . would order again .  
1	  I know , this is a cheaper camera . We 're all trying to save these days . Still .. this one is really bad . The design : cheapy . Sorry , I couldn't come up with another word for it . When my daughter went up to adjust it on the laptop , the base broke like it was made of sugar . The video quality is really poor - both pixelized and choppy . So you basically can't use it other than as a talking head , and even then , IF you 're not moving your head , your mouth , or breathing , then you * may * get a recognizable image .. For this price range , it 's not the worse , but frankly , it 's not doing very much for you . For $ 39.99 , you can get an IPEVO POV webcam , that 'll have much higher resolution , better frames per seconds ( 30fps , standard on all chat services ) , solid design so you aren't afraid it 'll fall apart within 1 week , and you can hand it off to your kids to show grandma the dog without fearing for your $ 30 .. Overall , very disappointing , even for that price .  
1	  I installed the software for this product and it seemed to work fine for about 6 months . Then I had to re-image my system and can't get the scanner to work properly again . I have gone through numerous installs / unistalls , registry cleans and you name it . Purchase this at your own risk .  
1	  I bought my husband this item for Christmas from Sears . We had the same exact problem as Jefsav had with his . My husband used the recorder four times , and after he ejected the disk the last time , the unit shut itself off , never to be powered up again . We took the unit back to Sears and although it had been under the Christmas tree and not in use , they said we had " had it too long " to give us a refund so they replaced it with the exact same model . After exactly four uses , it did the same thing . This time we took it back and got a refund since we had only had this one for a week and there wasn't much hope of a third one working any better .  
2	  After a coworker stole my last connector , I got this one and it works perfectly . Listen to your Ipod through your cpu speakers or other freestanding speakers with a headphone input .  
1	  This memory was recommended by Crucial as being compatable with my MSI motherboard and was not .  
2	  Bought this for my daughter for Christmas & she loves it , exactly what she asked for ! Fits everything she has and plenty room for more !  
2	  I compared many 32 LCD TV 's and the Panasonic LX600 has the best picture quality . I compared LG , Sharp , and Samsung and the Panasonic has the best color and angle viewing . It 's a little more expensive than some other 32 inch models but for the price you get a better product . Only disapointment is that Panasonic doesn't offer a 37 in model . This unit has 3000:1 contrast ratio , 8ms refresh , and 500 brightness . The stand allows for the tv to be moved side to side which is a nice feature . The speakers are on the bottom so the tv fits in tight place where some 32 lcds have the speakers on the side which increases the size of the tv . If there is any complaint , its that the remote feel cheap . Not bad , but just kind of inexpensive . Overall , I would recommend this TV to anyone looking for a 32inch LCD .  
2	  These headphones are wonderful . I am hearing challenged and can here music and dialog as never before when using my computer or the TV .  
2	  Gave this as a gift for my son . He loves it . Great price on a great telescope . Would buy it again  
1	  You have to jiggle the cable to get it to work sometimes . You get what you pay for , I guess . Spend the extra few dollars and get a good one .  
1	  The 3M filter should have fit my HP L1750 17-inch wide screen , but the filter is about 2 mm too wide . I had to use a paper slicer at a FedEx store to trim it . Without trimming , it 'd bend at one side making the screen unreadable . Felt really bad to have to cut something expensive like this filter , but had to fix the problem somehow . The 8 tabs came with the filter , supposed to help making the filter stay put , didn't work . The filter doesn't stay attached to the LCD monitor . One edge of the filter ( usually the top one ) would lean outward agaist the tabs in a slight angle fashion ( about 1/4 inch between the tabs and the screen / filter . ) That makes all the texts and images blurry and hurt my eyes . Adjused tabs to angel against the screen so the filter stay as close as possible to the screen , but the glue on tabs gone non-sticky . Went on 3M website , sent an e-mail , was helped to a link on 3M to ask for more tabs for free . Tried to place new tabs in the angle fashion , but * sigh * really ? ! ? Do I need to do all these for an expensive brand-named product like a 3M filter ? Still , once in a while on every day , some of the tabs 'd come back to 90 degree ( natural / parallel to the screen ) position and the filter leans against them instead of staying on the LCD screen . Privacy : not so much . Viewing angle too wide , but okay for most of the time . Eye-strain : Bad ! I have to squinch my eyes to read things because nothing is focused / clear anymore , and I tried both glossy and matte sides . " Bottom line : will not recommend this to a friend . " Wish I could return it , but too bad I had trimmed it :(  
2	  EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE BUT THE INK PRICES ARE EXTORTIONARY . THE PRICES ON AMAZON BEAT WAL-MART .  
2	  The Bell South - Model CI-85 Call ID w / call waiting unit arrived fast , new , and in excellent condition . 4 line display is large and easy to read . Easy to use with a neat dual display feature which allows you to see an incoming call while you are on the phone . The contrast button allowing you to tailor the brightness of the display worked well . 2 AA batteries ( not included ) will backup this unit 's call list in case of a power outage and also includes a battery low indicator . Owned for approx 1 month and it is an outstanding caller ID box .  
1	  This was ordered in error so I returned it already .  
2	  If you want a simple camera with good image quality , this is the one to get . For basic stuff , you can't go wrong .  
1	  It is already damaged . It is not worth to return as return charges will be more than the cost of product .  
2	  What can I say , this is what the the folks buy who demand the best .  
1	  Ok , i bought this mp3 player for my little brother for christmas , i was excited because it arrived earlier then expected , BUT with a million problems . First , the operation manual , if thats what you want to call it , is one sheet of paper stating the on / off volume and play buttons . I plugged it in , charged it for a day and a half and STILL it will not turn on unless plugged into a computer . Also , i have put some things on it like music and a movie , but it will not show up at all . Also , the ad says 2GB but i only got 1GB . THEE WORST Mp3 PLAYER EVER ! BUYER BEWARE !  
2	  Seems like a great lens , no problems indoors or out . I shot about 200 photos so far with zero flare from this lens protector .  
1	  This tripod is not very adjustable . The legs slide out but there is no way to keep them in place . The only locking feature if the twist to tighten piece for the head . Your much better off dropping a little extra cash on a mini with locking legs .  
2	  I use mine for other pictures as well as i-zone pictures . If used correctly , it works pretty well . Plus I can upload it on my computer and send pictures via email and put on my homepage . It cost much less than a full-size scanner and is pretty flexible . Check out [ .. ] for all the uses .  
1	  I had brought these speakers to be disappointed , the LED in the speakers didnt work at all . I sent them back for a replacement and those didnt work as well . I had to contact the Pyle company to find out that the speakers LED only works if you have a amp hooked to them or have enough watts to work them . I wouldnt have bought these if the site would have said that in the first place . The site says when they are in use the LED would work .  
1	  I have had numberous back covers and most of them crack at the corners a few weeks after installation . This one is still perfect . I love the rubberized plastic feel , helps with it not sliding around on your hand . Update : Had the cover for less than a month , and one of the tabs on the side that holds it on snapped off . I am not rough with my ipad , and it does not get dropped . I take very good care of things . Now it 's useless .  
2	  My wife gave this to me as a birthday gift 2 weeks ago . So far so EXCELLENT ! Since I have already had a Tungsten E , I did not even pay too much attention to it at first . Because I think Tungsten E has been simple and good enough , except that its battery life is not as good as I expected . I am a person like simple life and also love reading . I need a PDA , not for internet , not for game , not for music ( I have a very good mp3 player ) and not for movies etc . The MAIN reasons that I need a PDA is for 1 ) . reading e-books , 2 ) . addresses ; 3 ) . appoinments ; 4 ) . memos . since this machine is smaller than Tungsten E and has much better battery life . It met my purposes very good , much better than tungsten E.Strongly recommend it for people who like simple life and love reading !  
1	  I purchased my Replay 5080 in late December 2002 . Initial setup was a breeze . However , the problems soon started . I was unable to speak to any human in technical support until early Jan . 2003 . I think the entire company closed for the holidays . After speaking to multiple support reps , my machine worked for 2 more weeks . The next " glitch " was in the software . They were aware of the problem , but did not have an answer . I shipped the unit back ( at MY expense ) and received a refurbished unit within 10 days . This unit worked for all of 3 weeks . It froze and no support suggestions could get it running . This time it took a week and multiple calls to get a supervisor to OK the return . ( At least they sent an airbill this time to pay for the return ) . I am still waiting for my 3rd unit . This is their last chance . I would not suggest buying Replay TV until they figure out how to make their units a little more reliable . I feel I know more about fixing this product than some of their tech support staff .  
1	  Can't help feeling that another reviewer 's comments about Creative 's business plan might be accurate . Looks nice , performs well but the headphone adaptor seems almost designed to break . I suspect the 30 day warranty is because Creative knows this . I 'm certainly not an Apple freak and would rather buy something else , but feel MOST reluctant to buy anything from Creative ever again . Oh - maybe that wasn't such a cool business plan on their part after all ..  
2	  I 've owned Tivoli Model One 's in the past and was not disappointed with the Model Two . If you want a good , simple , even retro looking radio go with Tivoli . Compared to the over priced plastic Bose radios , Tivoli is a winner for me and I can upgrade it later with a subwoofer and CD if desired . Everyone that has seen mine gets a twinkle in their eye ; and when they hear it pulling in stations up to 75 miles away they get hooked .  
1	  I bought this desktop in February , received and set it up March 2006 . It has great features like being able to insert media devices on the FRONT of the PC , Lite-Scribe , etc . , however , it crashed - either motherboard or hard drive - just five months after I bought it . HP was helpful and will fix it under the one-year warranty , but it should not have fritzed just five months after purchase ! I 'm always very careful with my PC 's , virus protection , firewall , turn off at night , etc . , and hadn't even learned how to use many of the features before it crashed . Very disappointed . I hope it lasts more than another five months when I get it back . In any case , I won't buy another HP . Thank goodness for my trusty old Gateway which I kept after the " new and improved " PC came in , which is what I 'll use until the HP is " fixed . "  
1	  It is so true that you get what you pay for ! These batteries barely hold a charge . I got only 20 photos from one and none from the other . Do not waste your money .  
2	  My husband and I were about going crazy with all the remotes . We did not even look for a " one size fits all " because we thought we would have to spend a thousand dollars or more . Low and behold , I found the Monster when I decided to shop for one to give to my husband for this past Christmas . We have now used it for 6 months and we love it . It is definitely user friendly . This is the only remote we use . Be prepared to spend some time setting it up , but after all that , we have had only one issue with it : after we shut off the system subsequent to watching a DVD , when we go to turn the system on for just regular TV viewing , the right video number does not come on . We then have to turn the system off and then turn it back on . Everything is great after that . A minor inconvenience when we think about all the frustration we experienced with the handful of other remotes . We simply have not had time to reconfigure the settings and after all the reviews regarding the customer service , I am very encouraged to contact them and feel confident that this minor problem will be fixed . I highly recommend this remote .  
2	  Typewriters are hard to find . For me it is a small supplement to my computer word processing . Nothing works better at filling out forms than a good typewriter .  
2	  Great idea ! Instant access to the code , no waiting for shipping . You can use these MS points to use with the Xbox 360example : download movies , games , videos , Gamerpics , Gamertags , Download new maps , weapons , game types , themes , etc .  
1	  I bought this product becaue it was CHEAP . FOOLISH ME ! Right from the time I was a kid , I 'd hear people say " if anything 's too cheap , there 's bound to be a catch " . Exactly the case here and I was too lured by the low price to see reason . I was also assuming that since this is a JVC product after all , it is bound to be good due to the brand recognition . Boy , was I WRONG ! Basically , EVEN AFTER B0TH THE S0FTWARE UPDATES , it constantly keeps losing the signal , even in subarban areas with zero tall trees , no tall bldgs . Once lost , it takes too long ( 15-20 minutes ) to recalculate . Voice guidance is inaccurate , inaccurate ( Example : it says " turn right in 300 feet when actually you should be turning right in about 25-50 feet " ) but trust me when i say this product is pure junk . What you really need is a GPS that latches on to 12 satellites with WAAS . This uses very old technology , hence the signal loss and cheap price . Since this uses the old technology , it is simply unable to pinpoint the location of the car resulting in it being off by 250 feet on average . I returned the product for a full refund . Other GPS devices with similar features ( that have good reviews ) are going for $ 475 + . This is priced at $ 220 . That 's enough proof this product 's JUNK .  
2	  THERE IS REALLY NOT MUCH TO BE SAID ABOUT THIS TV THAN HAS ALREADYBEEN SAID HERE . But i still do want to add a few lines . For those of you who had the bitter experience with the delivery , I will say I am really sorry for your pain . I did not have exceptional experience with the Eagle delivery guys except to say it was delivered on time unpacked and placed where I wanted it and they left . The real sweetness of this whole experience is the unbelievable price you get from Amazon , No taxes , NO shipping fees . Circuit City and BEST BUYprices are almost $ 1000 + more and they do not even have it in stock . For those of you saying you are getting HD channels without a cable box and do not plan to add a sit top box , I will say don't short change yourself , because the real beauty of this TV is hooking it up with a cable box through HDMI inputs . Enjoy the fullness of what this TV has to offer . Go the whole nine by adding a basic Home theater system to it , and you have a movie theater in your home . SWEET ! Summary : This is the TV of all Tvs . Can't say more .  
2	  I love it ! It 's sturdy and made with nice thick material . The little metal topper does come off and can get lost if you aren't careful . However , that is a minor nuisance . This is made of steel and NOT aluminum which is way better for your health  
2	  A bit large and heavy but excellant construction . Other than that the title says it all  
1	  I frankly hear very little improvement over the run of the mill earbuds . At 76 bucks or so I expected a significant difference . Probably my hearing isn't good enuf to appreciate the quality these buds are supposed to represent . I still prefer my ancient over-the-head tiny-bud set i got with my 1980 's sony tape walkman . They stay on while I walk and the sound is acceptable . gm  
1	  This is a nice looking compact device , but that 's where the benefits end . I had this thing for about two months and it worked flawlessly until it died . I unplugged , replugged , unplugged yet again and nothin ' . The modem to which it was attached was also powercycled and when connected directly to a PC it worked fine . Not only was the wireless portion dead but the wired connections were dead as well . The useless Netgear just sat there with some of its LEDs running except for the one with the everything's-OK-checkmark . I tried contacting Netgear 's tech support department but they charge $ 33 for a support call . How nice of them : release s ( * $ t that doesn't work right then charge people $ 33 for repair . Nice way to encourage people to never buy your products again . POS . Why the hell does something like this break ? It has no moving parts and is even plugged into a UPS device . Needless to say this wireless router met my concrete floor at a high rate of speed and I 'm about to go out and buy another model from a different company .  
1	  As of this writing , this product IS NOT Vista compatible regardless of what their web site says . TrendNet claims the XP driver also works for Vista . " You just have to plug the board in , turn computer on , let it self install , and then upgrade the driver to the XP driver on install disk that came with it . " When I upgraded the driver to XP , it locked up my computer trying to install it . I thought the first time was a fluke , so cleaned out the registry , and tried it a second time with same results . The desktop is brand new and is not corrupted with other software or hardware . TrendNet 's customer service is borderline rude . They basically try to hang up with you as fast as possible even though your problem is not even close to being solved . The price is nice , but you 'll be wasting your time and money .  
2	  This adapter works very well , after a very simple installation process . ( I am running Win2K . Results might be different for other operating systems . ) I really like the software monitor that comes with this item , which allows you to visually locate and select the access point . Nices adapter , painless setup .  
2	  the camera is great and does more than we actually expected . I was rather surprised to find it would not work until I went and bought a card for it . I assumed and was surprised one was not included . Since buying it I have found the prices are dropping fast so I may have paid too much . The camera is fantastic .  
1	  Netgear has great exterior design , however , its hardware inside is totally useless . It frequently stop working in higher temperature , by that , I mean 70F , especially when more than one people connect to it . It works fine for a while ( but still slower than its optimal speed ) after replug the power cord . However , I still need to replug it at lease once a day . And it 's not just my netgear have problem like that , but also my friend 's and the dialing one ( different model , but with the same issue ) in my apartment . So before Netgear fixes this problem , I won't buy any netgear router for a while .  
1	  Is a 4154a picture ; you call it a 4153aWhich is it ? One drum has a 3 " roller . The other an 8 " roller .  
2	  I purchased this product for my husband 's birthday . We really like it . It has tons of features and once you read the manual is very easy to use . Would highly recommend .  
2	  After trying the Bose Triports ( and returning them within 24 hours ) I was thankful enough to come across these V-Moda earbuds . These have to be one of the best sets of headphones I have ever owned . The sound quality and durable design of this product speaks for itself . I have yet to find a pair of earbuds that can even come close to these .  
2	  5 minutes after receiving the package and using the wipes , I had a clean and usable xbox 360 game . It went from being unreadable to working completely normally . The product worked as it was supposed to !  
1	  I have had this product for a while . For the first few months I owned I had nothing but good things to say about it . It allow multiple PC 's to share a connection , provides some measure of improved security , and effectively isolates the DSL PPoe software so I don't have to install it on my and my wifes PC , and my notebook or reinstall when I upgrade , and gets the PC started because I do not have to log to PPoe each time my computer turns on . I incorrectly attributed the occasion glitches to my DSL modem . Then I tried to setup a server and use forwarding . This has problems so serious it could only be described as unworkable . Some other people don't have the same problem , others do . I have tried everything . The Tech Support is useless . I plan to try a competitors product , anyone want to swap ?  
2	  I 'm archiving 50 VHS tapes on DVD and this box is just right for organizing my disks . Its sturdy and durable . Got it cheaper from Sears .  
1	  The Kodak Easyshare EX-1011 Digital Picture Frame is a good product unless you want to use one of its most highly touted features of wireless capability . The onboard memory works great , the USB input capability works great ( using a thumb drive as input as well as direct connect to the computer ) , and the SD card input works great . However , if you want to use the WiFi connection within your home to display your photos from your computer located in some other portion of your home , forget it . After weeks , I have still yet to have success in getting the unit to communicate wireless to my computer . It connects to the network okay , but talking to the computer is another issue entirely . I 've tried to get support from Amazon as well as the Beach Camera , the company Amazon works with for this product and Kodak - all with no success . By the way , be aware also of the Kodak Easyshare software suite that literally takes over your computer and installs gobs and gobs of unwanted / undesired software . I have not determined specifically yet , but I believe the software actually contains a rootkit . Right now , I 've completely uninstalled the Kodak software suite because it took my computer to its knees and corrupted my registry in the process . So , if you want to use WiFi with the unit or the software that comes with the product on your computer , I suggest you look for another vendor 's digital picture frame product .  
2	  I like them so far ( after about a week ) . They sound good ( for what they are ) . It 's hard to find ones like these in stores . Amazon saved me yet again . I 've liked previous Sennheiser products that I 've used and this one continues that trend . I dislike earbuds and though the ones that came with the Zune sounded fine they made my ears feel uncomfortable . Also I worried about the issue of volume and not being able to hear sounds from outside . With these I can walk safely due to being able to hear cars and other sounds well . Edit : Six months later and they are still performing well . They 've held up to the wear and tear of being wrapped up into my coat pocket much of the time I am not using them . ( It 's cold where I live . ) No loss in volume in either ear , and the jack is holding up well . Edit2 : 10 months after original purchase the earpad where the cord connects snapped off ( though the cord itself remained intact , so that 's a big plus ) when tugged on by my niece . Sound was better with these but I got a pair of neckband earphones from another brand that are better designed . The fact the connection of the cord to both the earpad and jack held up leads me to keep it at the 4 stars I rated it originally . ( That and they were much cheaper when I purchased them compared to now ) .  
1	  I didn't notice any change in the operation of my cd writer after cleaning . The cleaner was supposed to play music while it cleaned ( 30 minutes ) It didn't .  
2	  I am so pleased with this product . I bought a Toshiba LCD last Black Friday ( 2008 ) and it sat in the box for over a year . Around the Christmas holiday I decided that I needed to use my tv and started looking at HDMI cables for the Samsung DVD player I was buying ( it doesn't have s-output ) . I saw this cable and decided it couldn't hurt to give it a try ( it was less than $ . 50 ) . I have been so happy with the quality of my picture . The quality is great and I don't feel like I just got ripped off for paying an obscene amount for something that isn't even the main part of my entertainment experience .  
1	  I own a Sony NX-30 camcorder . It has a problem in which its own factory lens shade does not stay anchored in the screw grooves of the lense . The weight of the rain cover yanks this flimsy plastic lend shade right off and then the rain cover hangs over the lens . Somebody needs to devise a raincover explicitly for the Sony NX-30 , accounting for the included external microphone being mounted on mike shoe of camera . SONY the corporation should make their own rain covers to exactly fit their cameras . A word about " rain covers " . There is a difference between underwater video and just wanting to protect your camera above ground in the rain . The latter is what most pros want to do . They simply want to keep rain out of critical electronic components of the camera . All the manufacturers should manufacture such a cover and make it available as an option , including option of folks wanting to mount an external mike . It seems design engineers do not talk to the users of the equipment . 3 minutes of talking to camera users would result in far better designs .  
1	  I have backed up all of my pictures on this hard drive and it 's a good thing I have them on disk also , because it died after about a year and a half ! I 'm very disappointed that THIS is supposed to be my backup in case something happened to my computer and it died ! Not to mention that I spent $ 160.00 on this worthless piece of junk !  
2	  After opening the product you can see it is of high quality . some cables do not use twisted pairs . This cable has twisted pair wires . Good cable for the money . Package arrived on time and in good condition  
2	  I 've been working on a 365 photo project since February of 2009 and I found myself encountering difficult shooting challenges . For those of you not familiar with 365 shots , the goal is to take a self-portrait of sorts every day for a year . The shots can be part of your body , face , finger , shadow , etc depending on who 's rules you follow . Anyhow , arm 's length self portraits and perfectly synchronized self-timer shots get really old really fast . This remote was just what I needed ! I shoot with a D80 and the 18-200VR lens . The shutter release offers me so much more freedom with my shots . I especially like the timer delay release when I push the trigger and it goes off seconds later , not sure if that is unique to my camera ) . This gives me the opportunity to point the remote at the camera and then stash the remote out of view . Shutter release time is pretty speedy when I push the remote buttom . Sometimes I have trouble juggling the focusing process when using the remote . I can pre-focus by depressing the shutter release halfway or adjusting the manual focus and then firing the shot with my remote . As far as I can tell , the remote will not initiate the auto-focus mechanism on its own , too bad . This can be troublesome with self portraits when I am the subject that I 'd like my camera to focus on . I also I wish the remote did not have to NOT have to be in a direct line of sight with the sensor . Sometimes my long lens gets in the way . Overall , I have been extremely pleased with this product and I would recommend it to all my friend with compatible cameras . It is small , lightweight and very easy to use . It has vastly expanded my composition opportunities . I even at times will hold the camera in one hand ( in some precarious way that doesn't allow me to press the shutter release directly ) so then I fire the shot with the remote . It works like a dream . PROS : small , lightweight , easy to set-up and use , decent response timeCONS : needs direct line of sight to fire the shutter , focus is only possible from the camera body itself and not the remote  
1	  this was my first flash-based mp3 player , and i did a ton of research . so i decided on the rio sport 256 mb because of the price , design , and the fact that it was a refurb ( which i assumed would fix some of its problems ) . i assumed wrongly . as described by other owners , the player began to shut itself off during my workout sessions . i 've concluded that the battery , during minor bumps , loses contact with metal connections , thereby shutting it off . note that when this happens , the player resets . so if you were on song number 76 , you 'll have to scroll to get back there . since i 'm not a bookmarking freak , this was quite annoying . also , my up volume button is sticking . it 's a shame , because the player was really nice . headphones are good , i liked the fact that the player isn't shaped like a pack of gum , and the ability to add an SD card was cool . that said , i prefer stable functionality over design , but man is it nice when you can have both . so , i 'm currently in the process of returning mine after owning it for less than 3 months ( bought in Sept 2005 ) . i think i 'll try a Creative MuVo now , and see how that goes . oh , and since i detest the itunes software , that rules out apple products . though , from what i 've seen , they are plagued with their own problems too . happy hunting , folks .  
2	  Great value for the price . I needed text-to-speech so I would not have to take my eyes off the road . This gps works great . I only wish that the volume could be made to go louder than it does as I don't think it can be heard clearly over the car radio .  
2	  I purchased this lens about a month ago ! From the moment I took it out of the box I knew this was going to be a great lens ! the construction of the lens is solid ! it uses a 82mm filter wich lets a lot of light in ! this is good for indoor pics , and also keeps your pics bright and sharp ! I also own the Sigma 70-300 APOand I use the 28-105mm about 75 % of the time ! I use to use Canon lenses exclusevly ! but after reading reviews and experincing Sigma quality for myself ! I now use Sigma lenses " Exclusively " These lenses could go head to head with the big boys " canon & nikon " and beat them every time on price , and tie if not beat them in photo quality ! I highly recomend Sigma .  
1	  I purchased the Apricorn EZ 60GB storage drive and it would not reformat . After I tried to reformat the unit , according to the instructions , my PC locked up and I had to remove it from the USB port . This problem continued so I contacted Apricorn support and their suggestion didn't work so I contacted them again but no reply . I guess Apricorn support only allows one question . I returned the unit to Amazon . From my experience I cannot recommend the Apricorn 60GB storage drive nor the support . This could certainly be an isolated case but the high price of the unit prevents me from trying it again .  
2	  Sometimes , when I 'm walking around and I see people with CD players , I just have to wonder how they manage . The most amazing thing about this device is the size . Not just the size of the iPod itself , which is a lot less than half the size of other MP3 players that hold the same amount , but the amount of space it saves you in terms of CDs . Have you ever seen one of those CD towers with around 60-70 CDs in them ? You know , the ones that are as tall as a bookshelf ? How would you like to carry that around in your backpack at school or in your pocket on the street ? I think carrying this thing around , which happens to be the size of a deck of cards and holds even more than those CD towers , is slightly preferrable . The next best thing about the iPod is the batteries . This thing goes for 8-10 hours without quitting . That is the same amount of time as a CD player , and twice as long as other multi-GB mp3 players . In addition to that , you never need to buy batteries again . Just plug the iPod into the wall at night and you 've got another 10 hours of music when you wake up . That 'll work even if you only sleep for 3 hours a night like me ! So this thing is saving both space and money ( batteries ) ! The third thing about this is how well it turns heads . Sometimes I try to hide this thing when I take it out , because strangers will literally come up to me and ask me " is that an iPod ? " and want to play with the buttons and stuff . Sometimes , it gets a little annoying . In these cases , the size comes in handy because its very easy to hide while you are using it . But if your in the mood to turn some heads , just put this thing on your lap and play . There are tons of other great things about this . The interface is beautiful .. sometimes , I just stare at the screen while a song is playing , or turn on the backlight for fun . It takes 10 minutes to fill the entire thing , meaning that if you ever get tired of the songs you put on it , you can have them replaced in the snap of a finger . But it all comes down to this ; when you buy this , you will never need another music player again . If you have a Mac , go buy this . The money you save on batteries and future music players will more than make up for the .. price tag .  
1	  Seller sent me the wrong item , one without the MiniSD adapter . I bought this item so that I could transfer data to it using my phone ( with a miniSD slot ) and move to my wife 's phone ( MicroSD ) . Customer service will not respond , I plan on disputing the charge with my CC company at the end of the week .  
1	  Windows XP refused to load the drivers from both the install disk and from their website . This happened on two different systems . The install disk has drivers for several devices , so it was difficult even finding which one to pick . In the end , none of them worked .  
2	  I bought 2 of these .. the first one broke when our camera fell on a rock . It protected the native lens and did its job . Very transparent and keeps picture quality intact . No issues buying a second and recommending it .  
1	  This is the worst modem I ever have , I will give it 0 if I can . 1 . The driver totally doesn't work on Win2K , simply didn't dial ( query modem looks fine ) and froze the machine . 2 . Incredible unstable connection , on Win98 , 80 % chance you got 14.4Kb with this so called " V. 92 " ! My phone line is perfect , my laptop and my old ISA modem all get 50K + consistently . 3 . No manual , no support . Don't touch this garbage . I get a $ 15 no name modem and works perfectly .  
1	  Although this pack is the best you can buy if you want to save money , one realizes early on that companies producing photo printers are making too much money on the printer ink : they have to bring down the prices eventually .  
1	  I gave this item a try and while it could actually work as advertised-it really was unreliable . I followed all the instructions diligently and found it cumbersome to assemble . While I was able to feel secure leaving my compact notebook on it , I am not sure how after a couple of weeks of use it would hold up-long range durability didn't seem like a reasonable expectation . Great idea , but poor execution .  
2	  Note : I browsed through literally hundreds of ~ 30 $ headsets on amazon and other sites , reading reviews etc looking for one that wouldn't break in a week but also have good quality . These are it . These headphones are great for people on a budget . For 20 bucks you can't get much better . The sound quality is pretty good , and the mic works as advertised . I use these to play video games and they are definitely a step up from iPod ear buds ! As for the reviewers who say that this headset is very uncomfortable , that 's because they haven't adjusted them . Although its not very obvious at first ( its somewhat hidden ) , you can change the " height " of the headset . At the default height it is VERY uncomfortable , but when adjusted I barely notice that they are on top of my head !  
2	  Shneider products well known in european photo hobbyist world . A multi coated UVa filter is one of my choice .  
2	  I like this receiver very much . It has back panel conveniece outlets ( 100 watt unswitched ) , a tape monitor loop switch , and mutes the sound briefly when switching inputs for reliability . I believe other comments concerning reliability and hiss are just unfortunate occurances in an otherwise well built reliable unit , and are not typical of the unit that you would probably receive . Its ' best feature is the sound which is very listenable and musical allowing one to enjoy the sound for hours without interruption . It is a bit bass-shy in the lower octives when compared to receivers fron Onkyo and Yamaha and does not have a low inpedance design . I can't comment on the competition in this price range but do feel it is an excellent value and that you really wouldn't go amiss purchasing this unit . Overall , 5 stars .  
2	  I was attracted to the video mode on this camera-with a 2GB memory card , you can hold about 2 hours of video on the highest quality setting . The " Best Shot " modes are great too and can also be used while you 're shooting video ; I use the scenery ones a lot and there is definitely a difference , and the " night portrait " mode is great as well . The only con I 've run into is that changing the settings for things like macro mode , motion , etc . , are not intuitive and are hard to find without reading the manual first , as opposed to my older Nikon Coolpix camera , where everything was obvious and simple .  
2	  Wonderful product . Supports every type of memory cards .  
1	  I have the unit installed on my home network , and it does work , albeit very slowly . I had purchased it in order to use it in conjunction with a four-drive USB 2.0 enclosure , but after some discussions with TrendNet , they admitted that the TS-200 would only ever see one of the hard drives in that enclosure . So , I had to buy a single 500gb external drive and now use that , but even in that configuration it 's painfully slow and still doesn't work with some backup programs . And the documentation is not very complete , etc . , but that 's almost to be expected ..  
2	  Okay , first the disclaimers : I have had my Tungsten E for exactly 2 days , so I can't whine about post-warranty problems yet . I have not added an SD card yet , so i don't know how fast or slow it is . I have not had time to discover the detrimental effects of the nice little flip cover . And I am not a tech-head , so my knowledge and needs are rudimentary . And , finally , I have a Mac . That said .. I have just upgraded from the original Handspring Visor ( deluxe , I think ) . It was a fine machine , but I just got tired of the monochrome screen and needing to find a couple of AA batteries every few months . So it was time to move along . I didn't need anything fancy , and since I have a very small digital camera , I didn't need the added bits in the Zire 71 . So the Tungsten E was just right for me , and I couldn't argue with the price . It came in virtually no time from Amazon ( which had the great price-thanks ! ) . I loaded the updated software and hot synced and was pleased to find that all my addresses and my calendar , which I kept on the Palm software on my computer ( s ) , made it in their entirety to the new PDA . Plus , after actually reading the manual for a few minutes , I was able to download some of the extra stuff I needed or wanted ( calculator , Documents to Go , etc ) . And then I figured out how to transfer photos ( jpegs ) from my computer to my PDA . Very simple , very quick , very cool ! I love the bright , colorful screen . It makes it such a pleasure to work on it . And , for my fellow Mac-ites , fear not . I have the latest OS ( 10.3.3 ) and everything works just fine ! I had absolutely no problem interfacing , downloading , etc . Finally , several folks have bemoaned the absence of the hot-sync cradle . I too used one with my Visor , but I must say that , not only do I not miss the cradle ( I can hot sync in my hand - and if you have a Mac , you know how easy it is to get to a USB port ) , but I like the fact that it uses an ordinary USB A to mini USB B cable . You can get spares at any electronics store ( for about $ 25 ) or for only $ 10 online at buynshop . com ; or a few reasonably priced accesories can be had from tangshop . com ( go to Palm Tungsten E accessories ) . So , thus far , I am delighted with the Palm Tungsten E , how it works with my Mac , the stylus , the look of it , the cable , the price-and that 's about all that there is , I think . I will probably eventually look into a spiffy case , and an expansion card , and whatever other bell or whistle seems to be in order . Bottom line : can i recommend it for Mac OS 10.3 users who want a user-friendly , sort of basic handheld ? You betcha !  
2	  This is an awesome piece of technology - in gaming , using the XBox360 with Call of Duty and Halo3 , you experience no lag time . The picture quality is " Top Notch " and I would purchase this again without hesitation . I was using a Samsung LCD prior to the purchase of the Aquos LC32GP1U and find the Aquos to be a much better monitor in terms of speed and quality of video .  
2	  This is the best full size keyboard for a Media Center HTPC for the one simple reason that it communicates via the IR receiver ( note that you need the right receiver ) . This eliminates the problem of your keyboard loosing connection with a Bluetooth or RF dongle that most other wireless keyboards use . This loss of connection often happens when the HTPC wakes up from sleep mode , but with this IR keyboard that never happens . The major problem with this keyboard is the stick mouse which is extremely stiff when the keyboard is new . As other reviewers have stated , this problem decreases as the keyboard is used . The left and right click mouse buttons also have a tendency to stick so build quality is a bit suspect on this keyboard , but it 's the best full sized Media Center keyboard available right now that I 'm aware of .  
2	  This wire was perfect for wiring my apartment with 5 speakers ( the sub-woofer uses a different kind of wire ) . At $ 16 it was priced right , but at the $ 29 I see it listed at now I would look elsewhere .  
1	  We use this printer with AutoCAD . Our drawings use different line thicknesses , and the HP 2600 does not seem to recognize anything thinner than the standard width , it will print thick lines . I would think that with a printer of this caliber dpi would be able to print thin lines . We have contacted HP and they were no help in this matter . The printer will also grab 2 sheets of paper frequently - it 's only a month old . We are very fond of HP products , we are just dissapointed with this printer .  
1	  As several others have already noted , the case is way , way too small . You CAN cram the S5 IS in there , but when you do get it in , it 's so tight the lens cover pops off and the zippers will probably split in no time . Not having a strap is also a big minus .  
1	  All I have to say is read the other reviews and I am having all those problems and more . I am also returning this item for something better . Our battery has never charged from the day we bought it and the screen goes blank all the time and you have to start over by unpluging it . Just a pain in the neck to own this machine . This is ment to make your life easier not harder and more madening .  
1	  Maybe OK for around house but barely works 1/2 mile from radio to radio . OK for around the house but we have trees and whatever else seems to block the transmission . We live in central Mississippi . I understand their test for 10 miles is in the desert where it is flat . No rolling terrain which doesn't roll that much in Mississippi .  
2	  this is one of the best laptop ever built . Even with this refurbished unit . This machine runs like a dream . Screen is bright and i bought another battery for this laptop . I have IPAD , HP touchpad and Android touchpad . I find myself using this laptop 99 % of the time .  
1	  I currently use a Sony Mp3 player , model # NWZ-S615F , and the only reason I ordered this little piece of junk was because my Sony isn't compatible with Audible . What a big mistake . First of all , it never fully charges . Doesn't matter how long it 's plugged , it only charges about 2/3 of the way . Second , you can't turn it on / off without losing where you left off . I am constantly listening to audio books , and to have to fast-fwd through hours of content to see where I left off is ridiculous . I am not happy at all . I 'm sticking with my Sony and screw Audible .  
2	  I bought one of these little APS cameras on a whim right after Christmas about 2 years ago when the price was reduced .. I was having lots of trouble with my fancy and expensive Nikon Nuvis 120i APS so I needed another camera for all the APS film that I had . The .. Nikon took terrible pictures and I figured this camera had to do a little bit better . Boy , was I wrong ! It takes great pictures ! I carried it all over Europe last summer in my pants pocket while I watched other photographers lugging around their thousand dollar SLR 's . No one ever knew I had a camera ' till I pulled it out , flipped up the lens cover ( which doubles as a flash ) and started snapping away . About the only feature it doesn't have is a zoom lens ( which I would rarely use anyway ) . Go to your favorite camera store a take a look at this little gem and play around with it . Good Points : Tiny , like a pack of cigarettes , lightweight , flip up flash , sharp lens , fully automatic , self timer , drop in film loading , reduced red eye from the flip up flash . A LOT of camera for the money . Kodak did their homework on this one ! Bad Points : APS film ( more expensive ) , no zoom , tiny viewfinder . ( sometimes it takes a second to get your eye propery aligned ) I now have a months worth of euro-photos ( about 250 pictures ) to remind me of my great trip and not one turned out unacceptable .  
1	  this product did not last 6 months . it will not play or record and i cant get the disk out of it . cyberhome will not return by e-mails and i cant get any where when i make a phone call . save your money and buy something else  
1	  Please be aware that this is not a genuine XM cassette adapter . The item came in the envelope in just a small plastic bag with no indication of brand / company address or whatsoever . The adapter is 100 % not-working . I plugged it into the car cassette player . After 5 seconds it gets ejected . Tried 5 times . Spend couple more bucks and buy original adapter . This thing is completely useless ! My first bad experience on amazon .  
1	  This may be a good radio . It should not be listed in the HD Radio section . It is not .  
1	  This wireless mouse is horrible . It stopped working after a couple months , probably due to the fact that the reciever couldn't find the signal from the mouse . Have tried using advice from Kensington 's support page , but nothing has worked .  
2	  This is the best diskette you can use . Perfect for schoolwork , documents , or like me , creating games . This has lots of room for any personal stuff . I really liked having them . They are much easier to store than those bulky ZIP Drive disks .  
2	  I Got my first mac october 2005 , After being a microslave for 12 years I was in desperate need for a real Operating system . so I purchased A 1.5 ghz Powerbook . And since then Have not been able keep off the mac platform . So recently purchased a 20 " 2.16 imac with the 256 MB upgrade . This computer does everything . Its ilife suit is second to nothing . Love itunes and all the cool osx tiger features that Vista has now ripped off . This computer plays games like Nothing , Have not had a game yet that it struggles to perform at high settings . And the pricing I think is great , people complain that macs are over priced . Well have you went to [ .. ] and configured a computer to the same specs as a mac ? Most of the time the price will be hundreds more . And please keep in mind the money that a mac saves v . s using windows . First off you get ilife , What would a dvd editor , sound track editor , web-page maker , and photo manager cost for the pc ? I bet Hundreds if not more than a thousand . Second how often does the average skilled computer user need to take there pc in for virus and spyware removal ? Or have to purchase virus protection at roughly $ 50 a year , or per visit . Well that adds up over the years . And what is security worth to you ? Macs cant be broken , dont have viruses , yet some claim to be , if you look at the facts of the current " Mac Virus " What they dont tell you is that you need to do a personal download to get it , Click to install it , and enter in your admin password and continue through the installation process , Dont seem much like a virus to me . by now you should realize why buying a mac just saves you money , and if you couldn't grasp it . Continue to suffer with Microsoft .  
1	  1 . Wireless connection is not smooth at all . Keep getting stuck . Have to manually reset it quite often . 2 . Have been updating new firmware whenever a new one is available . Hoping the quality would improve . However , with every new firmware , the quality seems gettign worse . 3 . Now , after 8 month of troublesome experience , the wireless signal is totoally gone . Both my laptop , pda cannot identy a wireless signal at all . Have to call linsys to replace one tomorrow . I won't buy linksys anymore !  
2	  I researched filters and this one is well rated and at a good price . I have had several of them and have saved my lense a couple of times . Shipping was a bit slow , but still acceptable timing .  
2	  I received this unit yesterday . It came in a long box . The arm is well made and very durable . The wing to tighten and loosen is easy to grip and again well made . Metal where it counts . It 's not heavy and fits into some of the bags I already own for c-stands , etc . I would definitely recommend it . Awesome product .  
2	  We got a pair of these for our 3 year old for our flight to Sydney , Australia . They worked great ! They let you control the volume so you do not blow their eardrums out . They are a perfect fit for our son . After other flights and more use , we developed a short in them , and the company mailed us a replacement for free . WOW ! Gotta love that .  
1	  Totally defective . Returned it . I will just go to my local RadioShack for a cheaper one that actually works . Cons : Very cheap lookingLoose in the plugDEFECTIVE ! Pros : I can return it for a refund .  
1	  I should have listened to the previous reviewer who said the iron was too hot - only one setting and my hair was frizzed for a week ! Maybe if it had another setting , lower , it would have been all right . I had to return it immediately . Could NOT use it . My hair is fine , and a lot of it . Maybe with different textured hair , it would be OK .  
2	  i always take an extra fully charged battery everywhere i go with my nikon . comes in handy . youll never know when you 'd run out of battery .  
1	  After buying this product to replace the terrible ear buds that came with my iPod Nano , I was greatly disappointed . There is no bass , the ear pieces don't fit and the sound is tinny . If you are looking for an inexpensive headphones that gives you a great sound , THIS AIN'T IT !  
1	  I feel misled by the rave reviews here and elsewhere . I jumped at this given the price and others ' praise . The latter was misplaced ; the former wasn't low enough . The MM22 might be fine for a hotel room , but it 'd better be a damned quiet hotel . I have trouble hearing the damned thing even when I press it to my ears . Yes , I 've found the volume buttons , and yes it makes a difference - from inaudible to barely audible . The design is cute , the carrying case is nice ( though excessive unless you need to carry all 3 cables and all 3 adapters , which you won't ) , and the price is low . But cheap is cheap , and this one 's not the effort .  
1	  After receiving the cable I installed it on my digital menu player and it did not work . After 2 hours of trouble shooting our media player we looked at the cables and found the cable we just purchased had a pin pushed in 3/4 of the way and would not work .  
2	  I have owned these headphones for about a year and they have been great . I am a student and I carry these headphones around in my back pack so they 're always getting books thrown on top of them and beat up . I have been very pleased with the durability of the headphones and the wire . I have rolled over the chord with my chair multiple times and haven't had any damage to it . The chord can be cumbersome at times because of its length but it is also nice to know if I lean back or stand up I won't yank the chord out of the device . Sound quality wise they are fantastic for the music I listen to ( mostly rock , jazz , dubstep , and a little classical ) . When listening to high quality audio files like . wav or FLAC these headphones really shined . The difference listening to an . mp3 and a FLAC file is tremendous , . mp3 sounds so lacking with these headphones compared to FLAC which is a loss-less audio codec . For those of you that are looking for headphones with lots of bass these probably aren't what you 're looking for . The bass is surely present , but it lacks the bump that the beats headphones have but I never cared for that . They have an open ear design which allows sound to escape the headphone which decreases the presence of bass . The HD 428 's ( Sennheiser HD428 Closed Circumaural Hi-Fi Headphone ) are great if you 're looking to listen to dubstep , they are a really bassy headphone . Just to warn you on the HD 515 's , the ear pads and head pad are made of cloth , not leather . I find them very comfortable to wear , great for the all-nighter 's during finals week .  
2	  I first got this keyboard set .. and I loved it . It has a Very comfortable feel and it is easy on the wrists and fingers . I also liked the fact that it came with a wheel mouse which was great for the package price . ..  
2	  Extremely pleased with this frame . Bought it as a gift . It looks very nice , not cheap and plastic-y . The interchangeable frames are a nice touch but the picture is the best I 've seen . Easily sets up for a slide show . Just pop in your card and it starts . Simple to save your photos onto also . I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one next time I need a nice gift for someone .  
1	  1 ) that in just a couple years , the battery wouldn't hold a charge and die in 45 min . and you can't change the battery2 ) the paperclip ( not supplied but don't leave home with out it ) Every owner now knows about the papercplip to reset and has one hid someplace . I gave it a rating of 2 because it held all the music i wanted , the shuffle play worked well , and was a nice music selection away from home . I now wish I had went main stream and spent the couple extra dollars and bought the Ipod at the first . i won't send mine to the landfill just yet , but as soon as it quits working on 110 , c'est la vie ..  
2	  I purchased this unit because I needed an economical stop-gap while I await all the new technology to shake out . It was also attractive in that I can use it later on an analog TV I have in another room . The unit is being used to play disks that are owned and rented thru mail order on a flat-screen HDTV . The mail order disks are often in less-than-presentable condition . In the past with my old GO-BLUE , the defects in the disks would often cause interruptions in the play . This unit doesn't miss a beat ; clarity and depth are outstanding , and I 'm not even using HDMI cable . The pause mode has become a favorite : if I get a long phone call and have to PAUSE , it goes from pause to screensaver to complete shutdown ; upon restarting the unit and pressing the PLAY button , it picks up exactly where it left off . My only gripe ( a minor one ) is the remote . Many of the keypads are small , play and pause are the same keypad , and STOP and EJECT are the same keypad-and unless you read the manual , you wouldn't know where the eject was . All in all , I can't complain about this player . And now that I know of some of the quirks , I would be comfortable purchasing Philips equipment again .  
2	  Excellent product . Better than expected . No reason to let the Big Boxes dupe you . This does everything for a fraction of the cost being charged by the retailers !  
1	  After two hours on the phone with customer service people with attitudes , I realized I bought a piece of junk and plan to order a brand new broadband router from another company . What a waste of my time and money . In a nutshell , this router did not work . All I wanted to do was hook up the router to one desk top and one laptop . The customer service rep , whom I could not hear because the line was breaking up because I guess it was overseas and I could not understand because of her heavy accent , told me I needed win zip to upgrade my router . When I told her I didn't have one , she said I should go to the computer store , buy Win Zip , and use it for the 30 day trial . I should download it on my laptop . Then I should return the software telling the store that I 'm not satisfied with it . I couldn't believe what I was hearing . I repeated it back to her , saying that she wanted me to buy software and return it because I needed it to upgrade my defective Linksys router ? Basically , she was asking me to lie and steal from a store ? She said yes , it 's not a big deal . I couldn't believe it . I will never buy another Linksys product again . Defective product and extremely unprofessional . I would have given zero stars if that was an option .  
1	  There should be a -5 star option .. I would have chosen it . Connections via wi-fi drops all the time . I have a WGT624 and a WGT634 . Both get stuck on the wi-fi all day . I need to unplug it from the wall to return it to a working condition . I have tried all availables upgrades and made a lot of " Downgrade " to try it out and after reading a lot of reviews and forums I have found out that NETGEAR does not work at all . Please do a favor to you . DO NOT BUY NETGEAR . I am trowing away my WGT 624 , 634 and MP101 and will only buy d-link or linksys in the future . Stupid option I made choosing Netgear .. Nao recomendo nada da Netgear . Eu comprei diversos equipamentos deles e NENHUM funcionou direito . Recomendo que comprem Linksys ou D-link se nao quiserem ter a dor de cabeca que eu tive .  
1	  This laptop is compact and stylish but not much else . Beware of the wireless ability especially . It contains an RALink RT2500 internal 801.11b / g card . Places in my house where my old Dell laptop got excellent or good reception , this one got poor or bad . Where my old Dell got poor , I could not get on my wireless network at all . I ended up returning it for a Centrino laptop , which have much better Intel wireless cards .  
2	  I purchased this unit to replace a trendnet 4 port switch . I simply ran out of ports . It works fine as long as the xbox360 is not plugged into it . I had to plug the 360 into the router itself or I would constantly dropconnections . I have a media player , desktop computer , laptop ( cat 5 ) , pioneer receiver and sometimes the basement computerall running at once . No problems . But plug the 360 in and big problems . Like always no two networks are the same . What does not work for me MAY work for you . Milton  
1	  This is first time to use non-original toner . I hoped I had a equal quality product . But it is not . The ink spread and the printed papers looks unclear .  
1	  The worst constructed filter I 've seen in my life time . Extremely thick . Its light weight makes me doubt if it is really made from glass . The mount ring can move sidewards for about 1mm apart from the glass ring , because it is made from a piece of plastic [ .. ] When mounted on lens , it is really too loose to keep it from dancing . It 's already full of dust between the glass ring and the mounting ring before I took it out from the shipping box , which make rotating a painful feeling . Avoid any rotation needed filter made by Tiffen ! Perhaps , any filter from Tiffen . Go B + W or Heliopan , they won't cost you much more but you 'll see what a truly beautiful filter should look like . [ .. ]  
1	  It does what you 'd expect , I guess , but I found I don't like to use Bluetooth for anything due to glitches inherent in using Bluetooth , including but not limited to interference , not being able to connect easily , getting dropped or disconnected , etc . What I mean is , the item is not defective or problematic , Bluetooth is .  
1	  I ordered this item for my husband 's birthday . It arrived in good time . The box showed some possible damage , but not much . The packing inside the box was on one side , pushing the interior box up against the outer wall . Regardless , all seemed OK . I carefully read all instructions and followed the assembly steps . Finally , to get the machine to operate you are supposed to do two things . First , you turn on the POWER ON / OFF button . This worked fine . All the lights and indicators lighted up . Next you are supposed to press the START / STOP button and then the turntable will begin to rotate . But NOTHING HAPPENED - no sound , no rotation , no anything . I read up on problems on the Web and also contacted the manufacturer by email . From Web discussion it seems that " inside the box " which a layman should never open , some major connection is disconnected . The manufacturer 's return email said to return the item to the reseller for an exchange ( thus indicating that no SIMPLE SUGGESTION could fix this problem ) . The website for this reseller says that once you open the manufacturer 's container for a phonograph , you 're on your own , they won't accept return . So now I have to sort all this out . Meanwhile , HAPPY BIRTHDAY ! for a $ 250 item . I plan to file an Amazon Shipping / Packaging review and to pursue getting an exchange item , but good luck ! I also plan to edit this review or add another one later when this " case " gets a little further along . Meanwhile I want to warn all buyers that THIS IS NOT ROSES - PROBLEMS exist !  
1	  These headphones are comfortable , they sound good , but whether it 's the 900 Mhz frequency or just poor reception from the headphones , these don't work well where I live . I could not get rid of the interference that would come through in waves , like tuning into a weak station on an old A.M radio . I tried re-tuning , adjusting the transmitter around the room , staying still in a place with the least static , all to no avail . Can't recommend these .  
2	  i bought this along with my camera and it working fine for last 1 month . i ahve used it to record WVGA video of a hockey game and it records really good . it can hold upto 1000 pictures in my camera . haven ; t formatted the card yet . so don ; t know about that .. surely recommended .. It is a really good deal if you buy a camera case too and make to 25 $ for supersaver shipping . Refer toCase Logic TBC-4 Camcorder Bag ( Black / Grey )  
2	  great sound , good bass , loudest cheap earphones you can buy . only one drawback , and i guess its my fault anyway - where the wires go into the earphones , they can break if you dont take care of them . so dont keep wrapping them around your ipod . this only occurs after a good 6 months of use , so for the price , its definitely worth it . ive had 3 pair , and its the same problem every 6 months , but at this price , its not a problem to get another pair . better than spending 40 dollars on a pair that do the same thing at 3-4 months .  
1	  What in the world was DirecTv thinking ? ! It must have just been $ signs because their decision to drop TIVO and go with their ownseverely flawed unit simply smacks of corporate suicide . About a yearago my first Hughes TIVO died due to a hard disk crash . DirecTV , totheir credit , replaced it with an R10 model for free . That has beenwonderful as it still used the TIVO operating system . But just lastweek , the Hughes TIVO in the bedroom crashed and DirecTV once againsent out a replacement . But this time it was an R15 . I only had totake one look at the totally brain-dead remote to realize this wasgoing to be a nightmare . And sure enough , just as soon as I had itconnected up and turned on , it rebooted 3 times all by itself , right inthe middle of configuring the satelite and remote . What people are saying is absolutely true . This is a piece of garbagecompared to our old TIVO units . In summary : 1 . The remote 's key placement and design is 100 % retarded . It nearlytakes two hands to use it . 2 . The response to button presses is delayed and sluggish . 3 . The failure to allow managing 2 tuners and their buffers is a majoroversight and setback from the TIVO units . 4 . The user interface is completely awkward and unintuitive . Even asan engineer , I had to thoroughly read the manual just to figure out howto record a program . If your mother can't figure out how to make herVCR record , she is NEVER , EVER going to figure out this beast . 5 . It is not possible to turn off our TV without having to slide theremote 's selector switch all the way over to " TV " , even though I haveprogrammed the remote for our TV 's codes and it works OK to MUTE andchange the volume . 6 . The fonts on the display are so small and narrow that it is veryhard to read on our small ( 19 " ) bedroom TV . TIVO had nice big screensbut these DirecTV guys must assume every TV you own is a giant 50 " plasma model because that 's the only way you are going to read thescreen without squinting . I could go on and on . I 'm so dissapointed with this piece of junk andthe fact that DirecTV has caused me to even waste my time on thisnegative review but I feel very strongly that the world needs to knowthat DirecTV has REALLY made a SERIOUS error in judgement thistime . I have been with DirecTV for over 12 years since I bought myfirst $ 600 receiver from RadioShack in 1995 . But I can confidently saythat if this is their new direction and policy then I will be happilyterminating my connection with DirecTV and sending my hard earneddollars to ComCast or DishNetwork very soon .  
1	  I tried using this device for my beloved IPOD . It wasnt nearly powerful enough to get a decent sound . Mostly all I got was static and a small tune in the background . Its a shame , because I would love to take my ipod with me in the car on long trips for everyone 's enjoyment . Im extremely disappointed .  
1	  I saw this burner in a store , entered my name for the give away and to my suprise I won ! It works pretty good , but it cost a lot of money for what you get .  
1	  I 'm not a system analyst , so I need really clear instructions for any new device . I bought this camera 1 year ago to use as a home security camera which I could view from the Internet at my office . Troubles I encountered : 1 . ) Set up was impossible . I finally figured out that I had to disable the wep on my wireless network thus inviting all my neighbors to free Internet connection . I wasn't willing to do this . 2 . ) I could view from the Internet within my home network , but not from my office . 3 . ) Had to convince one of my company 's IT system analysts to visit me at home and trouble shoot the camera 's system . Took her 3 hours of guess work but she successfully set it up and keep my network secure - which worked until I had to reset my router . 2 weeks of use in one year . 4 . ) I have never been able to have the camera send " snap shots " to my e-mail or ftp folder . D-Link tech support confirmed that I was setting it up correctly .. but the feature doesn't work . I was told by D-Link tech support that I may need to disable my Internet security program . No can do . 5 . ) D-Link tech support may not have access to this product - they are not able to respond to my inquiries . They would send me answers - but not to the questions I asked ! 6 . ) The weather protection cover is not designed for wireless antenna and has been out of stock each time I have tried to purchase - so I have not been able to install on the outside of my home . It therefore must be used inside which is not what I need . I could have paid < $ 80 for an indoor camera . Every so often , when I have a few hours to burn , I drag it out and try to make the thing work . For the couple weeks it was viewable on the Internet it provided a nice view of my home , but it wasn't useful without snapshots or any type of archived image documentation .  
2	  excellent radio . Reception is far better than what we would normally get in our valley . Works great and like the option of being able to charge your cell phone . With power outages and hurricane season , it 's well worth the $ . Like the convenient carrying case too . Bright orange color makes it easy to find in a rush !  
2	  I got this to extend the phone jack from our kitchen to computer room for a dsl modem and it is working just fine . We do have some extra wire , but I think the 30/35ft would have been to short . I haven't experience any connection issues using such a long cord ( thank goodness ) and eventually we will put a jack next to the computer , but this works just fine for the moment .  
1	  Bought this router early July , set up was relatively easy and straightforward ( I 've set up many routers and home networks before , though ) . Every 4-5 hours we will lose our internet connection for anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes . Then it will magically come back up . As of this moment , I have called tech support seven ( 7 ) times now - each time they had me change a different setting . Why wouldn't they just have me change all those settings right off the bat ? Irritating and illogical . It doesn't matter though , because even after approx . 3 hours time spent with D-link tech support , my router still does not function as it should - I still get extremely slow and / or intermittent connections every 4-6 hours . Completely unacceptable . I will be returning this P.O.S. for a refund ASAP .  
1	  As mentioned in previous reviews the system does crash in a consistent manner . Mine took a year to fail , but it freezes after several minutes of play and the chapter selection fails completely . Also , Thompson Electronics , the service support for RCA , is expensive and provides very poor service . Their solution to fixing my problem is to send a refurished system without even looking at my system . They cannot send a new system , since RCA stopped producing this product . I think that should indicate something .  
1	  The battery would never take a proper charge for a new battery . Full charge would take over 20 + hours . I even properly charged and discharged the battery three times as recommended . After a visit for technical service on the issue , the tech ( at a private repair service ) said , " .. your problem is the replacement battery .. get a battery directly from the laptop manufacturer .. " . I did so and it performed a 100 % to my satisfaction . The defective vendor made a return of the battery for credit to my credit card , but that still cost me time out of service , technician expense and lost shipping charges both ways . My suggestion on laptop batteries is .. get them directly from the manufacture .  
2	  it 's a great inexpensive ( considering what you are getting ) set of speakers . I recommend them .  
2	  Installed this in my office , works great . Hey , it 's a switch , they either work or they don't , and this one does .  
2	  QAM tuner picks up all my HD local channels , plus INHD and TNTHD from my local comcast market . I work at CC , so I got to know the TV really well from how it looked at work . Once I took it home , it looked 10x better once I was done with my calibration DVD . I sit about 10.5 back , so analogue doesn't look bad at all . I must say , this set does analogue stuff fairly well . Local HD stuff looks phenomenal . I don't even like NASCAR , but FOX HD made me feel like I was right there . No uneven backlight issues , no blobs or anything else . Mine came out of the box looking great . For this price , I advise you give this TV a look . Once I hooked it up to a Blu Ray player , it looked GREAT . I highly encourage this TV for small living spaces like mine . My room is probably 12x12 , so it looks perfect .  
2	  Excellent product . I researched many brands and models before I decided onthis one , and I 'm glad I did . It was exactly what my husband wanted . It made the perfect gift . I received it quickly and the price I paidon Amazon was unbeatable .  
2	  I have tried alternative types of remote extenders including ones available at a popular electronic retailer . But this one is the only one I 've found that works as advertised ! I have it set up to control my HD Tivo box from a 2nd TV . It works great exactly as if it was in the room . I would highly recommend this for my type of situation or if you are looking to control your devices in a cabinet . I use the eye very close to the Tivo in my case but assume it would work if it was pointing towards multiple devices with a universal / harmony remote .  
2	  Replaced all the remotes on the coffee table . Satellite remote , receiver and Roku . All of my devices were preprogrammed . Just had to find the number and that was it . What really makes it useful is the macro function ( storing multiple commands on one button ) . The power blaster works . I placed inside the cabinet and it 's powerful enough to control the devices without pointing and no direct line of sight . The back-lighting of the keys is nice but could have been a little better . Buy it .  
2	  I have been a fan of Logitech for a long time now and I couldn't live without my Trackman . My first one died after my granson spilled juice on it . I 'm now on my second one for the past few years and I just purchased the third in case my current one goes . It has assignable button configurations and the trackball is acurate . Sometimes I lean back in my chair and use the mouse on my armrest or leg so I can truly relax . I also use it for gamming without a hitch . Love it . Also have a pair of 5.1 THX surround sound speakers by Logitech .. also Fantastic .  
1	  Same thing happened with me as other customers . I was denied the rebate because of UPC code not sent but I am sure that I sent it ! Otherwise no problems with the product as yet .  
2	  I have had one of these mice for at least 3 years and love it . If mine dies I will be buying another . I bought this unit for my mother who wanted it for media control so she could control media playback from her computer from some distance . It is working great for her too . Features I love : - Long battery life on NiMH rechargeables-The media controls ( play / pause , skip next , skip back , FF , REV , volume control ) - The internet browser forward and back buttons-Range for mouse operations ( < 10 ft ) - Range for media only operations ( < 30 ft ) - Well shaped to fit in hand as mouse and as remote-4D scroll wheelCons : - transmission range does decrease with unit age  
2	  I purchased the Olympus W-10 primarily as a general-purpose note and meeting recorder , replacing a micro-cassette . The W-10 generally met or exceeded my expectations in all areas . Sound Recording - This unit is extremely easy to use , and the interface software is excellent . Sound quality is very acceptable at the HQ and SP speeds , although I would not count on using the LP mode for anything , as the quality is very poor . I would have much preferred a 2-hour record time that was actually intelligible , instead of a 3-hour time that is not . The max usable record time , then , is at the SP ' speed , ' at a little over an hour . The voice-activated recording mode works very well , and has the effect of expanding your recording time by cutting out periods of silence . For my purposes , an hour is find . Microphone sensitivity is very good . Photo capability - There have been very mixed reviews about the camera feature , and here are my two cents on that topic : If you are looking for a camera to take on your vacation , you will be disappointed with this product . If you are looking for a solid voice recorder , this is a good product , and the ability to snap a photo or two in situations where you would otherwise not have access to a camera is a real plus . I have read reviews complaining about a lack of sharpness in the image . I don't think that this is a problem , as long as you understand that the photos are only at a 640 by 480 pixel resolution . In fact , I think that the sharpness is fairly good . What is less good is that colors are not very vivid , and high-contrast situations are not handled well . The photo feature is nice as a supplement to voice recordings , as a way to include a visual reference to the audio . When you play back a voice recording on your PC , any photos taken during that recording will be displayed at the appropriate point in the playback . I could easily live without the camera feature , but it is really nice to have . Battery life seems to be very good , as I have recorded 8-10 hours in all , with no change in the battery level indicator . Some other digital voice recorders are real battery hogs . In all , I think that this product is an excellent value !  
1	  I own many Sony products and have generally been happy with them . This one does not make the list . It is difficult to use , with a very confusing user manual . I called Sony . The person was very courteous but not knowledgeable . I felt I was teaching him more than he was teaching me . Also , the company that sold it to me has no technical support at all , which I did not know , until after the fact . I should have read their policy first .  
2	  Works amazingly well for the low price point . My Phenom 's cores haven't ever gone past 150ish , even with a full load . And that 's using the standard heatsink-fan combo provided by AMD . More than enough for numerous applications , too ! Awesome Product !  
2	  Wanted headphones to listen to computer at work . These far exceed my expectations . I love them . A Co-worker has the bose earbuds and they are definitely comparable . Great product for the price .  
1	  Included software - IntelliPoint 5.0 - is not compatible with Windows ME . IntelliPoint 4.12 from Microsoft web site IS compatilbe with ME but it 's not written for Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0 hardware - it was written for v1.0 . Microsoft , get your act together - how hard can a mouse driver be ? The way it 's set up in my system now - IntelliPoint 4.12 with this IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0 - is not acceptable - first , no side tilt is recognized with old driver , second , PS / 2 port connection makes the mouse jump around sideways , no problem in USB connection but still it moves sideways somewhat slower than up and down . I just can't believe MS is selling this mouse without older Windows support . What a shame .  
1	  I really liked mu iLuv ear clips when I got them but , after only a few weeks they are falling apart ! First the ear cushions fell off and now part of the mechanism itself has disappeared . This is just from carrying them around . They do not hold up very well !  
1	  Prior to ordering , I read some reviews that said this product was not equivalent to the " same product " in the stores . But , because I trust the products sold by Amazon , I went ahead and tried . The price was just too good ! Well , when something sounds too good to be true , it usually is .. and that expression was never truer than with this product . Each cartridge lasted about 1/4 of the time that the " same " cartridge from the store worked .. and there were print quality issues throughout the short lives of both cartridges , as well . I 've seldom regretted a purchase from Amazon , but this is definitely the exception ! Amazon , how do I get my money back on this ? It is definitely not worthy of your name . And how can a product that is so obviously inferior to the identically packaged ones in the store be allowed to sell ?  
2	  i had used several digital cameras . but Kodak DX3900 is simply the best . easy to operate and w / professional feature that i want from a camera .  
1	  This is not an audio cable . I received a power cord . The picture is the wrong item .  
2	  Just installed the Terk FM-50 in an outdoor location - on wall about 10 feet above ground . Reception of all local Philadelphia stations is amazing , full signal level on all , even the weaker ones . I did not aim the antenna at all , just picked a convenient location outside . Was worried that it was not mounted high enough but this was not even close to being a problem . I have a Sony HD Radio tuner and all HD stations are being received with no problem . I highly recommend this antenna . Great performance without any hassle . Easy to mount .  
2	  This cleaner is a cleaning machine . It does what it 's designed to do . I clean my discs from Netflix before I watch them & never have a problem . This thing works great ! Highly recommended .  
1	  Movie mode is great . The camera takes great outdoor pictures in bright light . But it is impossible to take a good picture indoor , no matter which setting I use . Even automatic setting doesn't work . All the pictures come out red and blurry . I can only use this camera for outdoor pictures and for video filming . I 'm a little disappointed .  
1	  Got the pack for my HP Jornada 548 . It is basically a peel-and-stick film . Firstly , its size is less than Jornada 's screen - about 1 to 1.5 mm on each side . Secondly , the film has some sticky residue that was left on the screen after I removed it . I like the idea of a sticker as opposed to original HP 's " clip-ins , " but it could be worked better . When returned to Amazon , I was warned I 'd be charged return shipping costs because " item did not fit my equipment " was my fault ( ! ? ) . Not a biggie , but description could be clearer to avoid similar experiences . Again , my experience applies to Jornada 520/540 series PDAs .  
1	  Simply put , do not buy this computer if it has Windows Vista . It is slow , freezes up , and was very difficult for my secretary , who is so so computer literate , to use . This was without the installation of any third party software , but right out of the box . When she wanted to sort names in a folder , it grouped them in alphabetical segments of A-H , I-M etc and it took her 20 minutes to figure out how to undo this . It is a bloated poorly done program , and it seems as though Microsoft didn't test this with a single consumer , or they wouldn't have released it like this . Also , I ordered it with Windows XP , but they shipped it with Vista . It was too difficult for me to pack up and to return , as I didn't discover it was Vista until I had it all set up and installed in a desk , which took about three hours , and I was essentially stuck with it . Finally , when we got around to installing our peripherals-card scanners , printers , and lab equipment , much of it could not be used as the companies had not yet developed drivers for Vista , including such unknown mom and pop operations like Fujitsu , Siemens , and Kodak . Microsoft blew this one badly .  
2	  Typical of Amazon , the options for price , availability and delivery were great . I would definitely repeat this order for this , a perishable item . Delivery was actually better than expected .  
2	  I purchased the TEAC 5.1 to replace a 20 year old Harmon / Kardon stereo receiver used in my den , so I do not use its video features but am more than pleased with its audio capabilities . The Pro Logic and surround sound settings do , indeed , surround and fill the room with rich full sound reproduction , whether from CD , phono , or FM stereo source . There are many options available as to speaker set up ( A-B ) , DTS , or the 5.1 . The remote is full function and works well from any angle . Controls are easy to use , well marked , and readily accessable . Screen display is clear and very readable . While it may not have as many bells and whistles as some newer 7.1 receivers , it more than fulfills my expectations and needs . The gold on black labeling looks great too !  
2	  It 's a cable . It works . Not much else to say . It appears well made and the connections are solid . Can't go wrong .  
1	  I knew the price was too low for a leather bag .. but I was hopeful . It feels cheaply made and extremely stiff . The shoulder straps are not long enough for me either . The bag arrived crammed in a box without any wrapper around it and bag is a little dinged up . There was only one little tag on the bag . There wasn't even any paperwork with it . Won't buy from this company again .  
1	  I saved up and purchased this keyboard several months ago - I was eager to find a keyboard that would integrate with a Mac and be useful for online gaming . I immediately noted the microsoft config as other reviewers have mentioned , but enjoyed using it . Keystroking is comfortable and responsive . But within a few weeks the center letter keys stopped working ( starting with T and R then on down . I have had horrible customer support from Razer to resolve the problem and I still have a very expensive and worthless keyboard .  
2	  So far , so good . Can't beat the price when you consider you 're getting two 2400mah batteries . Love the abilty to use AA batteries if I get in a pinch . I have the grip attached to a Rebel XTi and love the way it feels as apackage . Stabilizes the platform well .  
1	  the seller never hade the item he was selling tuck my money i called and was told the item just came in 7 was being shipped after 2 weeks i called the maker and was told this item has bin made in over 10 years  
1	  I bought this drive about 5 months ago . Just this week it stop recognizing original CDs and CD-rs . When I try to burn a CDr in Nero , Nero spits it out and says insert a blank CD . Tried every different brand , updated the firmware , and finally called Sony to RMA the drive . I spent over 2 hours on the phones with techs who have gone over every single thing I 've already done before giving me an RMA number . It 's been a nightmare and I wouldn't buy another Sony product because of the poor quality and bad service .  
2	  Amazing speaker . I bought this sub because of the other reviews from buyers and they are all true . I installed it in less than 30 minutes , it sounds great and I can't turn it up over minimum due to an apartment setting . Of course , I intend to use it to its full potential soon , but for right now I will have to mention that it is sufficient for my needs even at 1/4 volume . If I turn it up past that I have to worry about knocking stuff off of the neighbors ' walls . Probably one of the best purchases in value for money . In short - buy this sub , you will love it .  
1	  I bought this a year ago and it just stopped playing DVDs . It says it cannot read any DVD I have anymore .. and it just started doing that in the middle of a movie . CD 's still work . Of course w / Sony 's support it is cheaper to buy a new one than have one repaired . Shop for a better quality player .  
1	  The item received was not the item pictured . I received the item sold as a " Recoton " mini toslink adapter-which costs a lot less . So , this is a classic bait and switch move-but revised and updated for the online world .  
1	  This was a very good printer , while it worked . After two years ' moderate use , it began acting up . After arguing with it for too long , I realized that it was pumping black ink into the yellow cartridge . Every yellow I install ends up that way . Canon tech support advises that I needed a new print head at $ 80 + . Forget it ! My next printer will not be a Canon . I 'm mulling over running the printhead through the dishwasher or sormething like that . It probably won't take kindly to that sort of thing , but with nothing to lose ..  
2	  Good for the second TV in the bedroom to extend your DVR to your bedroom if you don't want to pay for extra receiver and monthly fee . With remote extenders work perfect , just like having the second DVR without paying monthly fee .  
2	  Inexpensive , no notable flaws , does the same thing a Monster cable would do for 10th of the price . At this length , you don't need to worry about signal degradation or anything like that .  
2	  This is a great thing to have for any sony device , especially that psp . it is super useful and , in the neon green color , a fun piece of hardware , not to mention hard to lose . I think that all sony device owners should have a piece of technology like this one .  
1	  I installed a v . 3 card in my Sony Vaio about 9 months ago . The installation and operation on XP home was flawless and if I reviewed the product then , I would have given it a 5 star review . However , the signal pick-up on the card has been diminishing over time - areas that had started out with a strong signal , now register as low . Finally the card stopped working completely . Right now the card only picks up a signal if it is placed right next to the WAP11 and then dies within 10 minutes . This would get one star right now if it weren't for the Linksys techie that tried to talk me through the problem , then suggested a replacement card .  
2	  I like this unit . It is hooked up to an S-Video in from my Digital Cable Box , and uses a component video out to a Mitsubishi HDTV . Picture quality is very good ; I 'm very used to my high-quality Sony DVD player DVP-NS700P , but this one is very close . There is just a touch of graininess to the picture from the Cable box , but then I 've not compared with other units . I think its more than acceptable . A DVD I burned played fine on the Sony .. but .. when I recorded one program , deleted it , and then recorded again , it would only play on an older Sony DVD player . My Sony DVD player is kind of touchy , anyhow . All told , I 'd recommend this DVD recorder without hesitation .  
2	  We have a car that has an AUX port . I wanted to be able to hook up our iPod through that instead of the FM stereo for less static . This Belkin kit does the job great ! Pros : The Belkin Auto kit charges the iPod while it 's in the car . I bought the Cables Unlimited Zip-Linq Male / Male Retractable 3.5mm Stereo Cable to go with it . This little cable hooks up to the Belkin car charger with just a little cable ( that retracts ! ) There is a sound adjustment on the actual charger part so you can control the volume that way too ! No static , great buy . Cons : None so far .  
1	  I am actually glad I didn't recieve the item I ordered , because I ended up buying one that is much nicer and has much better sound quality . I was very angry when I recieved an email from the seller saying the product had been damaged in shipping and they didn't have any more to send and that was it . No other suggestions , nothing . This item was for a specific event and I had to wait two more weeks until I was able to purchase another product and get it to my husband .  
1	  We purchased this item about 8 months ago and now it is completely broken . The TV no longer works and the speakerphone never worked properly . They only offer a 90 day warranty so .. out of luck ! I suggest waiting until the technology is better or getting an extended warranty if you can . Wish I had ..  
2	  After comparing , in person , over 15 of the most common ipod / mp3 dock speaker units , the IM600 was the best value for the money . Sounds incredible for its size , Has several audio visual jacks , a FM radio , and it 's portable with a lithiom ion battery and remote . Try and find any product in this price rage that offers anything close . Crystal clear sound with great imageing and strong volume . Not a base powerhouse , but very respectable . Some complained about not coming with a carring case . I found an Universal Voyager brand 96 CD case that fits like a glove after removing the CD sleeves for 11.00 w / zippered compartments that hold all the accessories at a large retail Mart . Bose can keep their 400.00 sound dock which by the way can only be sampled in most stores with an enhanced sound display they provide and not your own ipod . This product is real value .  
2	  I LOVE this case . My 15 inch and 17 inch laptops fit in it and I can carry additional folders and various business items in it . I have been getting compliments on this case for years and I need to get another one in case this one goes bad so I will be buying another in the near future . My only complaint is it is hard to clean and looks dusty after extended use ( months ) and that one of the locking mechanisms on the suitcase do not lock all the way so my suitcase is slightly open on one side ( which is frustrating and looks bad ) . If I could buy that part it would be perfect . The strap is VERY convenient for carrying the case . Definitely should get this if you want a stylish and business case instead of a packback to carry your laptop in .  
2	  I purchased this so I could have power for my GPS on my snowmobile . If you don't have a cigarette plug on yours , go to your local electronics store and get yourself a bridge rectifier , cut the plug off of this and connect to the rectifier , tap into 12 VAC and ground on the sled for the other 2 connectors on the rectifier and you 've got power . You do still need batteries because the voltage gets weak at idle , but there is plenty off idle . Get the bicycle mount for GPS to mount on handlebars . Been using this setup for a few years . Works great and is a smart idea in unfamiliar territory .  
2	  Bought this thru Amazon six months ago . Amazon has been great . Arrived sooner than expected . Got all the cool discounts . Overall , nice ' puter . Easily got used to the smaller arrow and right-shift keys . THE BAD NEWS : The DVD / CD multi-drive crapped out after only 2 months-one day it just stopped recognizing any disks . Toshiba customer support in various foreign countries ran me thru the normal checklists ( which I had already done ) and , after 1.5 hours on the phone , gave me a number and told me I had to ship the whole ' puter in for replacement / repair of the DVD / CD multidrive and that it would take two weeks or so . Now I can't just ship the thing off .. I 'm USING it . So they promised me that since I got " the number " within 2 months of purchase , it won't expire . I 'll let you know ..  
2	  After reading the reviews on the Oppo DV-70HD I decided to order one , and am very glad I did . I got my HD TV about a week before I got my Oppo and my HDMI switch so I got to watch several DVD 's on my new TV via my old Sony DVD player . Then the Oppo arrived and really blew the doors off the old Sony . I watched some of my favorite " Special Effects " movies and I felt like I was watching them at the theater again . I 'm not sure about all the concern over the DVD carrier tray . All carrier trays feel pretty flimsy to me , and I 'm always concerned about all of mine when my 3 year old grand-daughter is around . The only thing about it that really suprised me was that the tray itself is made from clear plastic . To me it doesn't feel any more fragile than any other tray , but the fact that it 's clear may make it appear more fragile . Overall , the build quality seems to be pretty good . Ultimately , the most important factor about any DVD player is how well it plays a DVD and this one does a great job . Inspite of concerns over build quality and other minor issues , the Oppo consistently earns very high ratings here and at other sites . That speaks for itself . Just get one . You 'll like it .  
2	  Works great ! Images are very sharp and the scanner is definitely travel size . Perfect for trips to the library for instance . Scans well enough to use in place of a desktop unit , if need be . Best feature is that it will scan legal size documents .  
2	  The keyboard is really convenient . It folds up nicely and can fit in a large pocket . It seems to be able to work with any PDA device with an infrared port on top . But it doesn't quite work as effectively as a normal keyboard , I think because of the infrared connection . I notice that sometimes I 'll hit a button , and nothing appears on the screen . I 'll hit it several times , then finally it appears , and typing becomes easy . It seems to temporarily loses connection , then regain it . Certainly beats typing on the Treo 650 , though !  
2	  Despite the comments by one , everyone loves thier player . I take mine everywhere . It has never skipped ( Even when I drop it ! Oops ! ) , and the finish is still there . I have had it for a year , and still haven't had to change the batteries . All of it 's functions are great ! Plus , it gives off great sound ! It 's size is also fantastic . In most of my pants , it can actually fit in the pockets . The headphones aren't the greatest , but who cares ? This is the best you can get for your money .  
1	  This printer produces decent quality copies and prints . My complaint and why it only got 1 star from me is the amount of ink this sucker drinks . It is the thirstiest printer I have ever owned . And , for some reason it uses the color cartridges even when printing in black . Another thing I hate about it is you can't print if one of the cartridges , it has 4 by the way , is out even if you aren't using that color . I 'm out of cyan right now and I can not print a document in black . I am going to be looking for a replacement printer soon as I will save money in the long run on ink .  
1	  I bought this camcorder about 3 months ago from circuit city . I don't have much complain about it except it stops working in less than one month , and my tape was stuck in it . Circuit city won't return / exchange it because it has past two weeks ( lesson : return policy does matter here ! ) and I have to contact the customer service of Panasonic . I mailed the camcorder to their service center following their instructions , now two months has past and there is still no sign of my camcorder . I called them several times and everytime I was told I need to wait 2-3 more weeks , they are waiting for some parts to arrive from China , and it seems there are several parts that need to replaced and every time they must order it from somewhere else . What kind of service center it is ! How could it be called a service center if they don't even have enough parts ! I asked for an exchange or refund , and was of course refused ( And to speak with a customer representive , you have to wait half an hour on the phone .. ) . Now my only choice is to wait , I 'm hoping to get it within one year .. Panasonic was a respectable name in my mind , now I 'll never touch any of their product . As for the camcorder itself , I can't comment much , it has everything I need and the picture quality is decent . But if you do decide to get one , better prey it never goes wrong . An update : one more month passed , I was told I need to wait another month , i.e. end of Nov . It will be 4 months for them to repair a new popular model camcorder , and God knows if I can get my camcorder back by then .. What can I do ? This has become ridiculous .. I never thought a famous brand would do this to its customer ..  
2	  Easy to install , I was set up in 5 minutes ! Good range , good speed ! It 's worth the cost ( which i found quite low ! ) . If you need wireless access , with good speed and security , this is the product for you .  
2	  It was a great product . The product works as it intended . I will recommend this product for those people who want to watch their tv on the road / outdoor by using slingplayer on their mobile .  
1	  No longer turns on after only 3 years of light use . When it does turn on , the disc drive won't open . Don't waste your money .  
2	  This helped my older PC a lot ! I should 've bought this upgrade a couple of years ago !  
2	  No complaints @ product quality or design , except it was @ 1 to 2 inches too big for a 15.4 " unibody MacBook Pro . My laptop slides back and forth in it 's " second skin " and I can actually use the surplus as a handle . Also it has a very strong rubber odor which will probably dissapate in time .  
2	  I purchased the canon S800 three years ago . I was very happy with that printer and I am thrilled to own the new I950 . Quality is there in build and print . Also , has a small footprint so if space is an issue this is also a good choice . Think tank system is a nice feature as well . I love it , I love it , I love it !  
1	  Sluggish performance after 9 months use so if you are buying this camera for a limited time use then its a good buy but its not worth the price if you intend to use it for a long time . Warranty included is 90 days which means you dont have anywhere to go after 4-5 months of use . Simply the pic quality starts to degrade after some time . I bought it in April 2003 from Amazon for $ 228 and it started annoying me by July / August 2003 . The video mode is the worst ever , in the beginning it used to give much better results but I am not fond of this now anymore . Better use a camcord to capture video images . The image quality at night is rated " 0 " by me , but again it all started after a few months had passed , I had no problems with this little thing in the begining . 95 % of the pics that I take now come out to be blurry and gloomy . Overall I dont recommend this camera cause it wont last long .  
1	  la compre junto con mi hard drive external pensando que la sugerencia para el case era la adecuado pero nada que ver me mandaron uno bien chiquito , tener en cuenta esas sugerencias  
1	  To put it mildly , this highly unstable product caused too much aggravation . I 'm using XP , SP2 , on a Toshiba laptop , M45-S331 . First of all , the CD-ROM instruction manual doesn't tell you that the device manager window will pop up continuously while the software is installing . It also doesn't indicate that the Found New Hardware Wizard will come on . Finally , it won't connect / pair the device properly . Never could get my bluetooth mouse to work . I 'm returning this immediately . Do not buy this product !  
2	  I 've enjoyed using this wonderful MP3 player while working out and sometimes when I have to walk somewhwere . It 's worked very well for me , but the other day it impressed the hell out of me . I had it in my pocket while I was riding my bike , and I had a little crash . I landed right on top of the thing , and it gave me a big bruise on my leg .. and I don't bruise easily . The MP3 player survived and still works perfectly , though the leather case took some damage and there are some cracks in the face . I 'm very impressed with the fact that this little thing survived the crash and I 'd reccomend this player to any who 's looking for one !  
1	  If I could give this product zero or negative stars , I would . Not only have I struggled to make this product lock when it is supposed to , but now that it will not UNlock , I called customer support to see what I am doing wrong . Their recommendation : " You have to break it . " I have to break it ? " Yes , there 's nothing you can do to fix it . There 's no special way to open it . If you enter the combination and it doesn't work , you have to break it off , like with a hammer or screwdriver or something . " The woman who told me this was very comfortable with offering this solution . I 'm off to go find a sledge hammer so I can take care of it . Would I buy anything made or sold by Digital Innovations again ? Need I answer that ?  
1	  Cheap and trash . Be aware that these speakers are USB powered , so you cannot just stick them to any old sound source . Besides , connecting it up to my Airport Express caused it to blicker and buzz in a most alarming way . This was much diminished when I hooked it to my PS2 , but persisted nevertheless . And sticking headphones on was a complete disaster - the headphones buzzed like there were angry hornets somewhere ..  
1	  The cable arrived in good condition and appeared to be of good quality . However , it did not transmit any signal at all . I understand that a HDMI cable of this length can be problematic , and it certainly was for me . I tried it with two different devices with no success . When I used a shorter cable , there was no problem .  
1	  No difference compared to another good cable costing 1/2 as much . Don't believe me - buy and then return it , or just save yourselfthe trouble . Monster preys on perfectionists . Those peoplegiving such great reviews don't know the difference betweenan ohm and plastic .  
2	  I plugged it into my panasonic cordless phone and it worked like a charm . The sound is clear , the headset is comfortable , and I can hear quite well also . What else is there for me to say ?  
2	  I called several IT places looking for a way to transfer the files off my old hard drive ( mother board failed on PC ) to my new laptop . They quoted me an average of $ 135 for the work . I found this product and thought I would give it a try . I received it in a matter of a few days and within minutes of getting out of my mail box , hooked it up . It worked quickly and very painlessly ; a no brainer . I 'm not an " IT " type of a guy but the PC noticed the drive , I copied and pasted and presto .. done . I saved more than enough to pay for a few rounds of golf . I highly recommend this to anyone .  
1	  I have to agree with the other reviewers - the Toshiba seemed to lose memory entirely too easily .  
1	  First time I used this item , I was very happy , it did a great job . I blushed ou the hairs and oiled the blades and put away . A couple weeks later when I went to use it again , the blades weren't moving , and I can't get anyone to replace or reimburse me . Don't waste your hard earned money on this product , look else where .  
2	  I purchased a 100 inch with 4:3 aspect ratio for presenting a professional course in a rented hotel room that had an 8 foot ceiling . The screen was manageble ( despite its length ) . The setup was easy ( leveraging off of grade school familiarity with projector screens ) . The aspect ratio and size did a fine job in reflecting the output of a video projector with normal room lighting . I saved the purchase price easily rather than having the hotel 's audio / visual contractor provide the equipment . I am very pleased with the equipment and savings .  
1	  bought this product to assist connect ipod shuffle 2G with docking station , however the ipod does not fit on the product - due to poor design of the product . makes the product a useless buy - waste of money . Kuljit  
1	  Bought one in Compusa at only 10 bucks after rebate . Went back home and started installing software by following the instructions in the manual . The driver is not certified by MS and this is mentioned in the manual . That 's fine , hit Continue Anyway and installation went on . At the end , I was asked to plug in the device . XP searched driver for this new device automatically and again I had to click Contniue Anyway . Then it reported a Code 10 error . Uninstalled the driver and reinstalled it . Still not work . Disable Ethernet card and tried . Same result . Called the technical support on Sunday and was helped by a lady . She instructed me to do the same steps that I have already done : uninstall , disable , restart , etc . She asked me to use the driver on their website instead of the one on the CD . I used the newest one on their website at the beginning , which has a time stamp of 11/2003 - they have not released any update for more than a year . Finally she asked me to go back to the store and make an exchange . But no thanks , I did a return . Think $ 10 a wireless-G USB adapter a good price ? I wish they could pay me $ 10 an hour to figure out how their crappy driver works . My case is not the only one that upsets Belkin customers . My friend bought the same thing on the same day - for the same reason of course . She did make it through the driver installation step . But the Belkin Wireless Network Utility always froze while searching for an available network . After killed most processes this application still did not respond to a mouse click . Too bad that she couldn't use the device even though she did not get a driver problem . I gave her a ride to the store to return the product so she can at least save some gas . Like the guy said in the other post : buy this for someone you hate . hehe ..  
2	  I bought this sub in order to add more bass to my home theater mini system , Panasonic Ak600 , which I also recomend . I also bought Monster Cable 12 foot sub cable and used the line in and out from of the Sub and my system , thereby avoiding the speaker wire . The sound is crisp and clean . I tailored the high cut and volume settings to my liking , and I love the standby mode . I use it for TV , CDs and DVDs . I use an optical cable with my dvd player so i truly get the . 1 in 5.1 It is definitely powerful and gives great bass on music and movies . I would definitely recomend this sub for the price .  
1	  The product seems ok - but it is hard to tell because one of the batteries was not working . Charging for 24 + hours resulted in nothing . Since it was the Christmas holiday , the company was closed until yesterday . I called , and after a little runaround , a new battery is now being sent to me . I will be able to tell more about the product when both radios are in working order .  
2	  After months of surfing the net for the latest and the best camcorders , I finally settled on this one . Runners-up to my final choice included Sony HC42 and the new PC55 . Both good choices , the first one for the affordability and the second one for the compact and stylish package . Both advantages I felt I achieved with the JVC GRDX307 . The price for the PC55 was ridiculous , at over $ 600 at the cheapest I could find , $ 900 at Sony store . The HC42 was ok , but still the resolution and other features lost to the JVC . Same with the PC55 . Another factor that tipped the scales in favor of the JVC was the memory card storage . I already use SD cards extensively , for my Palm , my wife 's Palm and the new Casio Exilim digicam that we plan to buy . It is a better , cheaper and more practical alternative to Memory Cards , which aside from being more costly , are always tougher to find . I felt that for practicality 's sake , I should use the same media for all my tech toys . Now I can view pictures taken on my JVC camcorder , my future Casio camera on my Palm . And if I run out of memory suddenly , I have the option of interchanging SD cards . The JVC 307 is light at 1.2 lbs ( with battery and MiniDV tape put in ) , it is very compact and ergonomic , and it is very easy to use . All characteristics that are important because the reason I bought this new toy is to take videos of my baby girl who will be born in two weeks time . I need a small camera that will not get in the way in the Birthing Room ( I will have my hands full with comforting my wife ) and for events after that , wherein I can carry the diaper bag , while pushing the baby stroller , with the JVC comfortably strapped to my belt . At first I was concerned with the Zoom , it was only 10x . The digital Zoom of 500x is negligible , since all images beyond 40x is no longer recognizable . But after trying it out , the 10x seems to suffice , provided you 're not a peeping tom . I imagined recording my little girl 's first stage play or recital ( yes I intend to use it for that many years ) with it and I 'm sure it will do the job nicely . Although when you zoom in at 10x , the image becomes incredibly shaky as the camcorder stability control ( ? ) can no longer compensate . But I hear it 's a weakness of most camcorders in the market . I have to admit the coolness factor is also a guilty pleasure with this JVC camcorder . With its vertical orientation , you will certainly stand out in a crowd of weekend warrior video photographers . The JVC 307 , with its 1.3 Mega Pixel feature , delivers very clear images at reasonable room lighting , though darker situations can be illuminated by the 3 LED lights on the front , a very unique and ingeniously simple feature that other camcorders lack . It 's like headlights on a car ! Still , as with most camcorders of this caliber and the subject of endless complaints from many reviews I 've read , the details become grainy and alien-looking in dark environments like the inside of your home after sunset . Perhaps future models will improve on this . But there is an ingenious solution to this available already in most homes including your own . Turn on the lights ! For its current low price , I can't imagine having another camcorder that would have satisfied me as much as the JVC GRDX307 .  
1	  very bad hardware . After 4 weeks the router started to hang , and I had to reboot it to unlock it . Now this happens every hour , and anyway when it is working my pages take 5 second to load , slower than dial up and I am on cable . I own and have used lynksis , netgear and belkin , all of them without a problem . I bought smc because of a professional review , but this is bad equipment . Their support is terrible , if you go to their website you cannot even find new or old firmware for this model . of course they don't want to honor the warranty because " it is working " . Stay away !  
2	  Am / fm Digital Shower RadioI have had many shower radios-all inferior to this one . It is quality thoughout . Love the tuning , the sound , and most of all the reception . We now can receive our favorite station in the shower . Impossible with the other shower radios . It is a 10 for sure ! Love it .  
1	  With a good weight of 3.4 pounds ( 54.4 ounces ) each , according to th seller , it appears that I have some defective ( underfilled / not filled ) cartridges . One unused one weighs in at 39.66 ounces , or 2.48 pounds . Another one , which only gave me a few legible pages , weighed in at 32.68 ounces , or barely 2 pounds . The third cart also only gave only a few pages before I took it out of the printer - it weighs 33.59 ounces . I returned these to the seller 2 months ago after they told me they 'd give a full refund . I 'm still waiting , even after repeated emails to them .  
1	  Never could hook up the printer , but it worked OK for a while until it started making erratic connection with the cable modem . Then " POP " , a bad smell , and I 'm out $ 100 ! Serial FR14A278A011564  
1	  I had the MPD820 for almost a year when it quit working . I was living in Baton Rouge and my family was in Shreveport . I had recently had a baby and was making the 10 hour round trip more than once a month . So to be honest , I wasn't much surprised when the screen of my unit developed a short in it from all of the bumps in the road ( the screen shifts in the sling as you drive ) . At first , I just had to readjust the screen so that it would come on . Eventually the entire screen went out . I say that I wasn't surprised by the fact that it went out - mainly b / c I have little faith in anyone 's quality of work anymore . So few people take pride in what they build . It is actually cheaper for Magnavox to replace those units which turn up defective within the first 90 days than it is to ( a ) build the unit correctly or ( b ) hire someone to fix those that have problems . I will definatly think twice before buying another Magnavox . I 'm now in the market for a new DVD player . I 'm taking suggestions as I obviously am not good at picking one out myself . ;) [ .. ]  
1	  I HAD THIS UNIT FOR 2 DAYS , IT BROKE , THEN I RETURNED IT AND 2 OTHER UNITS THAT I RECIEVED WOULD NOT SEE THE ANTENNA OR JUST QUIT , I WOULD WAIT UNTILL KENWOOD COMES OUT WITH A NEW AND IMPROVED MODEL , THEY ARE AWARE THAT THIS UNIT HAS PROBLEMS ..  
2	  Great headphones for price . Good sound . They were a little larger than expected and warm ears after a while of listening . I would recommend .  
1	  I bought 2 of these battery and 1 the them will only be good for 1 hour of shooting . Disappointed .  
1	  This Netgear router worked flawlessly for me for ONE year . After that it intermittently would loose wireless connection .  
1	  I ordered this 256MB PC100 CL3 DIMM Memory . What I recieved twice was labeled so , but was in fact only 128MB . I got no satisfaction from Viking on returning these items .  
2	  I 've been a Windows / Unix user all my life . This is my first Mac and I love it . Pros : - Mac OS X is way more stable than any Microsoft Windows available - Did you know that Mac OS X is UNIX-based ? I love real unix shell . - Light & small - Slot-loading optical drive is better than the regular one , IMO - Wi-Fi 802.11b / g + bluetooth now included - & uuml ; ber-long battery life . My 5-month old battery lasts about 3 hours when I 'm just browsing the web ( wifi-on , bluetooth-on ) - not likely to get infected by virus / malware / spyware . - iLife suite included - supports dual display - I use this PB as a desktop replacement - high quality soundcard - i 've seen some PC laptop that has crappy soundcard . It 's bad to the point that your MP3 sound really badCons : - Admit it , there are less software for Mac OS X. Make sure that you know everything you need has Mac version available . Don't depend on Virtual PC . It 's tad slow on this 1.33GHz cpu . - Software running on Mac is not as optimized as it should . - This is the cheapest powerbook available . It 's LCD screen isn't as good as 15 " / 17 " ones . It 's acceptable , reliable but you cannot expect something as good as - 256 meg of ram is NOT enough for you to run regular software smoothly . Consider adding at least another 256 . - internal fan is sometime annoying when you do heavy graphics / calculation . You cannot watch DVD fullscreen without headphone . It 's THAT noisy .  
2	  The Speakers sound great . That is what is really matters when you are looking for a Speaker set . There are plenty of specs , but I don't have the time or the inclination to get into it . Setup your speakers where they need to be , get a decent receiver and I have no doubt you will be pleased with these speakers . I have been enjoying the speakers for a month now and have been impressed with their performance in movies , television and music . I will say I paired my Onkyo speakers with an Onkyo receiver .  
2	  Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headset with Comfort Fit HeadbandI bought a similar corded headset that did not have a clip or as good of a mouthpiece for $ 18 plus tax at a retailer . I like this one better and it is priced lower . I don't think it gets any better than that . People can hear me fine off of my wireless home phone or on my cell phone . They can hear me better when I compare talking on the headset with talking on the phone 's mouthpiece . I can hear them at least as well in the headset as I do on the phone . I watched Dr. Oz on the OWN network in October 2011 , talking about how WHO , the World Health Organization , had recently , over the few months prior to October 2011 , changed cell phone status from " benign " to " potentially carcinogenic . " He said that the cell phone itself should not be carried in the pocket or held against the body , and that it should be kept as far from the body as possible . He recommended the corded headset . Additionally , Dr. Oz said that the bluetooth , or any wireless , headset carries a strong signal and that could be potentially harmful when worn on the body / in the ear .  
1	  The Sony MDR-J10 's concept appealed to me for its convenience - we all hate the times when we run and our headphones fall off because , well , there 's nothing to keep them in place when we 're constantly moving . The little loops that go around your ears really do keep the headphone buds in place , and you can bet your bottom dollar that they won't come off when you 're running . After a couple months of usage , though , I found two issues that persisted : ( 1 ) while the loops kept the earbuds near the ear , the earbuds would barely be in the ears - sometimes they 'd just dangle there , and ( 2 ) the earbuds would get really dirty from ear wax , to the point where the ear wax stuck in the ear buds would muffle sound . These issues sound a bit too minor at first , but they really do prevent you from listening to music in the long run . Allow me to explain . ( 1 ) After some time , ear buds don't go in the ear . The rubber loops , after having your headphones around for a while , do bend . It 's only natural , which doesn't make this Sony 's fault ( though , I do wonder if they can propose a solution ) . Because the rubber bends , the ear buds will not go into your ear after a while . They 'll * touch * your ear , maybe , but the point is , the sound will not go directly into your ear . This causes you to raise the volume on your mp3 player as a temporary solution ; however , when you 're running , this solution doesn't really work , as air movement crowds out the sound and all you hear is the wind as you run . If you don't believe me , please try it for yourself . As long as the ear bud is in your ear , sending music into your ear , you will hear the music - but if it 's not sending music into your ear , you 're not going to hear much . ( 2 ) Ear buds get dirty . They do . I tried to fit some of those foam protectors over the earbuds , so I can still hear music but ear wax doesn't get inside them , but the design of the headphones don't allow for such protectors to fit . Actually , you only need to use these headphones a few times before the ear buds get clogged with earwax . That earwax blocks the sound more , leading you to blast the mp3 player really loudly . After a while , you begin looking for alternatives to these headphones . Don't get me wrong - I love the concept behind these headphones , the concept of keeping the buds in place - but these really are inexpensive and they do come with their issues . I 'd say they last 1-2 months before it 's time to buy another pair . If you don't mind needing to buy new MDR-J10 's regularly , then I think you 'll like these headphones . Personally , I did not like them too much . Hope this helps . Feel free to comment / ask questions .  
2	  What more can I say ? This was my very first order and , thankfully , everything went off w / o a hitch . So far , so good . Just keep it up . Thanks ! Suzanne Dupree  
1	  After using the Canon A85 Powershot 4.0 megapixel camera for almost a year , I decided to upgrade to a high quality digital camera and chose the Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP.I was disappointed from the first picture . The autofocus was extremely poor . Virtually every photo taken in a variety of settings , lighting and speeds were soft or blatantly out of focus . The manual focus has no focus guide , either . Other professional photographers also tried their hand at this camera , only to yield the same results . I 've been taking photos for almost 20 years , and have used a variety of digital cameras through friends and associates over the past few years to get an idea of what non-film cameras can produce . This camera caused more disappointment than all the other ones I 've tried , combined . I took about 300 pictures , trying every avenue to produce a picture that looked like it was taken by a 8.0 MP semi-professional camera , to no avail . I found that my Canon A85 took consistently sharper images at 4x6 print size when shooting side-by-side . I returned the Digital Rebel after one week , and the search for a decent digital one continues ..  
2	  This memory card is a must have if you own a digital SLR and plan to shoot RAW format . You should be shooting raw if your are not .  
2	  I finally have one remote instead of five . This is much better . Sure , it took some time programming on-line but the end result is worth it . And anyone with half a brain should be able to master programming it to do what you want . Great product .  
2	  its a quality cable ! I have purchased a couple of these for surround sound powered subs with no problems . I have had them a couple of years .  
2	  We 've had our Presto microwave popper for over 10 years and it 's worked perfect everytime . We 've moved a few times , so we 've used it with 3 different microwaves and all worked fine with the popper . A few years ago , I found the inserts online really cheap and bought a ton of them , so I 'm set for quite awhile . I suggest googling them and I bet you 'll be able to easily find them if interested . The popcorn is always fluffy and yummy . It 's never burnt the popcorn and nearly all of the kernels pop . I read the reviews of those who gave 1 star just to see how anyone could not like this product and I think they 're adding too much popcorn . Some even said they used oil , which I don't think is at all recommended by the maker of the product . We wash the bowl in the dishwasher everytime and it 's held up great over the last decade . We 've also mistakenly washed the base in the dishwasher ( instructions say not to ) and experienced no problems .  
1	  Overall it seems like this printer would be great , however , there is a big big issue here . The pictures that are printed are very dark . This makes people 's faces almost impossible to see . I 'm using iPhoto to print my pictures instead of printing directly from the camera / memory card itself so mabye that is the issue . I 've seen this complaint on numerous message boards ( including this one ) and I didn't really believe it , but now that I own the printer I can tell you that it is a real problem . There has not been a " fix " released by Canon for this problem yet and I get the feeling there never will be from what their customer support has been telling me . Buyer Beware .  
1	  These batteries don't hack it . When recharged ( and I have a good charger ) , I 'm lucky if they last 10 days without discharging .. even if not used . In comparison , the Sanyo eneloop rechargeables are much , much better . Not only do they hold a charge well , they stand up well to moderate duty use . We have had good luck with the eneloop in our Canon camera . The Sanyo 2700 's don't last well there , and they won't even effectively power a cordless mouse .. a much lower power application .  
2	  I am using this for my office computer since it has an old system . I can't believe how easy it was to install and how well its working . The screen is perfect !  
2	  I have had absolutely no problems with this camera . Long battery life , great pictures ! It 's small enough that it fits comfortably in my pocket , yet it has a large LCD screen making pictures a quick task . I am satisfied with this digital camera , I would recommend this camera to anyone . It may be a bit on the pricey side , but I have yet to regret buying the camera . At the rate this camera is going , I doubt I will !  
2	  Like some other reviewers I saw , I bought this modem because my cable company decided after 3 years to charge me a modem rental fee . This is the exact model the cable company provided and one they support . I use Insight Cable in Columbus , Ohio . The only thing I had to do after hooking it up was call the cable company and provide the MAC address listed on the back of the modem , reboot a couple of times , and voila ! Back in business . I think some cable companies require a serial number but mine needed a MAC and both are listed on the back of the modem . This is a great little modem at a reasonable price and I would highly recommend it .  
1	  It was horrible , soon as i plug the speakers in it was making a constant noise , really annoying , the speakers were junk , worst purchase i 've ever made from amazon . I would 've returned them but I didn't want to go through the trouble of sending it back . So i just smashed them and went to best buy and got new ones . I know it was a cheap speaker , but hell it should atleast work properly . Talk about trash .  
2	  These speakers are can't-miss good in the under $ 50 price range . I tested them against several in a store and there was no comparison . Love the sound quality I 'm getting straight out of the box .  
2	  This cable is thicker , sturdier and better made than the typical generic cable , plus white is a superior color . and they work fine . I would buy this again . # Update : Still work fine a year later . I have two , each one runs to aSony CFDG700CP CD Boombox Radio Cassette Recorder , so each boombox is left or right channel . I run the boomboxes like powered speakers , they are connected to a mac mini . The mac mini output has a mini to rca cable in the headphone jack , and each rca end has a plug which converts a female rca to two female rcas . each one of those two rcas is attached to one of these cables / and that is how you use two boomboxes like powered let and right speakers . Hopefully all that helps someone out there .  
1	  I had originally rated this product with 5 stars ; however , over the past 3 months I have changed my mind . At first , I loved these headphones because they fit perfectly and were very comfortable for my 2 1/2 year old boy ( he does have a large head , so these were great :) ) . I bought them as a Christmas gift in 2011 to go along with his LeapPad Learning Tablet . Now it is early March 2012 and they are already not functioning properly . The sound is warped and low . They have been well taken of so I know it 's not something that we did . I am very disappointed that I bought the highly rated , expensive headphones thinking that they would last . Don't waste your money on these headphones !  
2	  I had tried another FM transmitter prior to this one and was dissappointed . This unit works very well , little or no noise , very good signal strength in the vehicle ( much better than the wireless , battery operated one I had prior ) . I 'd recommend getting this unit if you don't have an AUX-in and want to use an IPod or Zune in the vehicle . It also exposes a 12V lighter input so you can plug in other accessories . One improvement the product could benefit from is an on-off switch so that you don't have to unplug when you turn off the vehicle .  
2	  I bought the Marware package for my son for Christmas . He liked the Nike + for his Nano , but didn't want the Nike running shoes . He absolutely loves the Marware . It 's easy to see and adjust the Nano during the run , and the chip holder can be moved easily between different pairs of running shoes . Basically Mareware enables the runner to use the Nike technology without switching to Nike running shoes , and that 's exactly what we wanted .  
1	  I bought my new 15GB ipod at amazon here . The battery operation endurance is unbearably short , although the player has elegant appearance and awesome storage capacity . Charging One hour for operating one hour is my way to operate my Ipod everyday . I found the battery has memory effect , which means the battery cannot fully charged when the times goes on . Also the iTune which is the enclosed programme for arranging and organising songs or song list for ipod , is much difficult to organise songs than Winamp . Therefore , I recommend you to use winamp to organise song list and then press " import " song list in iTune to transfer song files to your ipod . If I were you , I would prefer to buy the new mini ipod . The battery operating hour may be longer than previous ones , I guess .  
2	  after countless tryouts of various plasma and lcd tv 's i decided to spend the big bucks and purchase the 46 " xbr3 . i replaced a phiilips 34 " tube ; its picture was really quite good on an analog signal , but with an hd signal the picture , tho better , didn't knock my socks off . after installing the xbr , i know see what all the fuss is about . to be honest with a regular analog signal my phillips picture was better .. but with an hd signal the xbr brings tv watching to a new realm .. it really is fantastic . we 've had the set for 3 wks now , and still love it .. can't wait to watch the nfl playoffs this weekend . if you 're looking for a 46 " set , be sure to give this one a look . yes , it does cost a little more than some others .. but in my humble opinion well worth it .  
1	  Though the product does what it is supposed to , there are just too many FM channels wherever I travel and the quality is not good . It is now my expensive ipod charger in my car .  
1	  Not worth of buying it , i got the Cassette Adapter last week , i not playing the songs well , songs comes like Murmuring , i don't why , i hardly played the songs .  
1	  I had four of theese units in place and they all got replaced by the FVS338 . The main reason is the speed . I have a lab and we tested the max Internet throughput of the FVS318 's at 1.2Mbps ! This is unacceptable . Oh yes , this is with the latest firmware . Several calls to customer service left me infuriated at the lack of comprehension of the problem . I contacted their legal deptartment the same day . Several promises were made on Netgears part wich resulted in them having another level 1 tech call me again to insist I reinstall my OS ! I have successfully sued to get my money back . With all of my venting done , I would like to say that I am still a fan of the Prosafe line and will continue to use it . But Netgear be warned , I will be all over you until you get this product line properly supported .  
1	  The Specs speak louder than the performance . 1- GUI on the 520 freezes up many times when browsing quickly thru folders and forces you to power down to clear . 2- After power-up , you also have to search for the Servers and select the prefered one every time even though I saved the settings . I have 3 PC 's on the net running Windows Media Server . If you forget to turn it off while running a slide show , it will eat your bandwidth past when the cows come home . 3- BTW , It will not read Media hosted by Windows Media Center Edition server . It will browse their menu 's but will not open any file at all . 4- So , Forced to run the D-Link Media Server on the main PC holding the Media Content gobbles up all available unused ports inclouding 80 and 8080 that are used by my web server . This is a fairly primative app . that is not auto-updating so as you add content directories , you must re-scan the media that takes 20 minutes on my 3.3 Ghz machine with ATA drives . 5- It does a descent job of displaying JPG files at 1080i on my 40 " Sharp Aquos LCD PROVIDED I pre-format the jpg size to exacly fit a 16-9 resolution multiple . Let it do the math and it adds 20 pounds to all the subjects on the screen including the dog . Wife joined LA fitness , but our house does look better , wider . 6- If you set the slide-show to auto-play , it will not respect the slide show delay between slides . I call support and after spending 3 hours in the bowels of Bangledor , India finaly got to a Level 3 Tech in California that said that was a known problem . He had never heard of Windows Media Center Edition and therefore could not comment on those problems . 7- If you have a new Sanyo Xacti HD Video camera , don't even bother tring to play the . mp4 files on this , it isn't supported . I count the days till the KISS DP-600 hits the Amazon shelves perhaps thru LincSys with 1080P and Media Center Comatiblitly .  
1	  I have had 2 problems with this router and have received factory support and replacement units without resolving the problem . 1 . Wireless connections on several of my home computers are intermittent2 . The router occasionally loses the ability to connect to the internet without any changes on my part . To resolve , I must reset the unit and reconfigure using the reset port in back . Review the Linksys user forum for further evidence of these issues . I would avoid this router .  
2	  The placement of the BACK button and scroll backward buttons are good . Easy to get at and out of the way of normal use . However , the FORWARD and scroll forward buttons are difficult to use and pretty much unneccesary , since it is very rare for me to use them anyway . Under normal usage , the mouse 's heaviness is unimportant .. but I can imagine it could be hard on a gamer . I like the ergonomics of the mouse , as it decreases the amount of hand movement needed for normal use . The left and right mouse buttons are a little hard to push , but I actually like that , since I can rest my fingers on them without accidentally clicking them . Overall , it is a very comfortable mouse to hold and move around . For me , they could have easily left off the FORWARD and scroll forward and task changer buttons , which I now completely ignore after some brief clumsy experimentation .  
2	  Does all it is suppose to do . I like the screen and the ease of operation . It 's great for trips andv gives great directions  
1	  I seriously doubt its 100 % copper . The cross section of the wires are bright like tin . Where as monster cable is same color as outer wiring .  
2	  setup was very simple , plug in the ethernet wires to the router , power it up , configure the other computers with router setup wizard or manually - do this on the primary computer , set security options , router assigns IP 's .. that 's all , start using it . I had great connectivity to my lappy for about 4-6 rooms down the hallway ( worked for me ) moreover the router is light weight , nice design , looks cool , for the price it 's a great purchase  
1	  Viewsonic seems to have a serious quality control problem . Bought 2 for a great price , one wouldn't work at all . Returned it , and the next one they sent was in a scotch-taped together box . It obviously didn't work properly either , so sent it back . Kept one , nice tv , but now about half the time when you turn it on , nothing happens , have to unplug it and the plug it back in . So it 's going back , too . And by the way , the fact that other remotes won't learn View Sonic 's remote is a HUGH problem ( just ask my wife )  
2	  After a lot of research and going back and forth on PDA 's and Pocket PC 's , I decided to buy the Z22 . For the price , I figured I couldn't go wrong . And this little baby delivers ! It does everything I could want it to do - keeps my calendar , contacts , to-do list ( which syncs super-easily w / Outlook ) - Surprisingly , I use the memo pad A LOT ! It 's great for taking quick notes on just about anything . It comes with some added features : Games , my favorites are solitaire and crazy daisy . Splash Photo , I use it to carry pictures of the kids . And a surprise plus was Splash Shopper . Being a gadget person , I 've always done my shopping list on Ecxel - where I could choose what I wanted to buy , sort it , and print it out by aisle / location in the store . Well , splash shopper does this so much better ! I always have my list with me . As I need things , I check them and as I buy things , I check them off . If you 're diligent at inputting data , you can know how much your grocery bill will be for the items you 've chosen before you even leave for the store ! I love Splash Shopper - besides the " outlook " stuff , this is my favorite feature . In conclusion , if you 're looking for a PDA with lots of features and an awesome price tag , look no further . The Z22 is it ! The only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5 , is that I wish it had a flip top to protect the screen . Then I wouldn't have to worry about it so much when I have it in my pocket !  
2	  The Ultimate Ear Triple-Fi headphones are simply the best . I am an audio junkie . I always used Bose speakers and headphones . I kept a good pair of Sony in-ear headphones for walking around , etc . A year ago , I purchased Shure SE210 , they were so good , I returned them and upgraded to the SE310 and they were awesome . ( For Christmas I was given the Bose in-ear headphones and did not like the fit or the sound . ) I was so happy with the Sure $ 200 + headphones , I could not image that anything could sound as good . Then , I tried the Ultimate Ear Triple-fi . I was terrified of the price . It was like listening to tracks for the first time . There are nuances , sounds , instruments , echos , I never heard before . And I consider myself a very discriminating and detailed listener . It was worth the money .  
1	  Unlike other Garmin products , including carry cases , this one is beyond cheap .. it is useless . It has a built-in plastic tray in the bottom but absolutely no padding . A medium sized camera bag would be far better .  
1	  I bought two of these 6ft HDMI cables and neither of them worked with my new Toshiba 42 inch LED TV . I tried them with a couple of different devices ( cable box and Xbox 360 ) and neither worked . When I ordered a new HDMI cable from Amazon Basics it worked like a charm . Obviously not all of their cables are bad otherwise they wouldn't have such a high rating , but obviously the cables I received were defective . Buyer beware .  
1	  First of all , the charger did not work at all after taking it out of the box . I took out the screws , opened the casing , and found that the source of the problem was a loose wire . After gluing the wire back into its proper place , the charger worked perfectly fine . Also of note , the cord is not nearly as long as it appears in the product picture . " Official " Nintendo DS Lite chargers have a cord that is 6 or 7 feet long , but the cord on this one is barely 4 feet long .  
1	  When I read it was tested with more than 100 printers , I assumed it would work with my 3 home printers . After all , they are HP , the most common printers outthere . Not so ! Turned out , it worked with my HP Photosmart 8450 , but didn't work with my HP Laserjet 1018 nor with HP Laserjet 3330 . Disappointing experience .  
2	  I 'm a recent convert to percolated coffee , and I don't think I 'll ever go back to a drip maker . This one is so much easier to clean , works well , and the coffee tastes great . The best part is that you do not need to use a filter , so it 's more eco-friendly too . We don't use the suggested filters , and we have no problem with grounds in the coffee . This coffee maker is a great deal !  
2	  FITS A 2004 DODGE INTREPID I would recommend this product to anyone . pros : fits my carCons : non so far  
2	  Although the price was a bit high , you get a great all-in-one scanner / printer / copier ! The programs are simple to use and the quality is excellent . You can even send scanned items directly into certain programs , like an e-mail service . The speed is incredible , it takes very little time to print in either black and white or color . Pretty much , this all-in-one is great if you want quality , speed , reliability , and ease .  
1	  This DVD player rates pretty high as probably the worst piece if electronic equipment I 've ever owned . I bought 3 of them ( $ 40 each ) . All 3 were defective . In my opinion they are built to break . It feels cheap , it looks cheap . Save your money .  
2	  It came fast and well nothing broken it works fine and does everything its supposed to do so its great .  
2	  I have this wired mouse and it truly was the best Logitech on the market . But , when I bought this model it was $ 39.99 , 3 or 4 years ago . Furthermore , it no longer works well because Logitech does not update an improved driver for this wired model . As someone earlier stated , playing games is difficult because this mouse loses track of where its at and freezes . In fact , Logitech does not sell this model any longer as wired . It sells a wireless version . No mouse is worth the ridiculous high price this one is carrying . So , who is choosing to spend the price shown here ? Why is it extremely overpriced here ? If you choose to spend this absurd price , do not install the software because it doesn't work right and there is no support to improve anything .  
2	  I already had a dvd player , but I was at a retail store looking around and I saw this hello kitty dvd player sitting there . I have a 55 " HDTV and what really caught my eye about this dvd player that is for " kids " is that it can be played in Progressive Scan which means I get the best picture for my TV with a dvd player like this and the other one I had didn't have that . So , I was sold on it and I am an obsessive complusive hello kitty buyer and fan . I practically have EVERYTHING hello kitty so it was a great addition to my collection !  
1	  Have other Toshiba products and have been very satisfied . this ones no good . Serious tracking problem on VCR playback made it impossible to watch since I purchased it . Received notice of the defect from the factory sometime ago but they never did anything about it . Will probably trash it and look for a different brand .  
1	  Play some Barry White on any of the acoustimess speakers and you will think that the speakers are defective or Barry lost his AHEM , um , um , a lot of weight . You will accuse the store that has them on demo of sabotage or bait and switch or some other dirty deed . Do not go to the blows store and listen to their canned demo disc with music tailored to hide the atrocious flaws in the speaker . I recommend that you buy anything but these .  
2	  excelent product met all my expectations . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . .  
1	  + ' s : small , looks cool , good sound quality - 's : i am running win 98 , pII 400 , 256 ram .. the software ( audio manager ) which is the only way to transfer music is very buggy , slow , and eats up to many resources ( feels like written in JAVA awt ) . 25 % success rate transferring songs over 6 megs . if i turn off the player in the middle of playing a song , the player will not play that song anymore .. ie : it will start playing and then 30 sec in it will jump automatically to next track . - go buy an mp3 cdplayer like pine technology 's  
1	  Don't waste your money on this sorry excuse for a DVD player . It would not play any of my DVDs . I own over 100 DVDs and tried 20 of them and none would play . Unfortunately I threw away the original packageing so I was unable to return it for a refund and now own a .. doorstop . Stay away from all Toshiba DVD players . I rated this player with one star because I couldn't give it a zero star .  
1	  Most of these might work from this seller , but mine didn't so I ended up buying a quality cables-to-go cable and that worked fine . When I compared this with the cables-to-go cable side-buy-side , this one was much smaller cable and end wise . This substandard cable also had obvious crimp marks at the ends and a section where it looked like they spliced the cable . This is the first time I received actual junk from Amazon or one of its sellers . This cable got tossed in the garbage where it belongs .  
2	  The Sony WM-FX197 is a top quality product . I love the mega-bass and the reception is very clear for the radio . The cassette part works perfectly . Cassettes that i have not been able to listen to for years i can now listen to again because of this product .  
1	  I am amazed by the number of positives reviews for the 880 .. and can conclude 2 things : either these folks have little prior experience w / digital cameras , or my camera is broken . And although my camera is sorely in need of a firmware update , I do believe it is operating as designed . The good points first .. in good lighting conditions , and when all of the camera 's parameters are appropriately set .. this camera has the raw ability to take exceptional pictures . The lens is quite good ( for a digi-cam ) , and the resolution provided by the 3.4 M-pix CCD is fantastic . However , such fantastic pictures are rarely obtained . The bad points .. 1 ) The camera is incapable of automatically setting its own parameters ( focus , aperture , speed , etc . ) on its own . Its " auto " and " Scene " modes stink . The worst is auto-focus . Even in bright outdoor pictures , this camera almost always produces focus errors . So far , I can always guess the distance to the subject and manually set the focus better then the camera can . And believe me , setting the time on a VCR is a lot easier than setting the focus distance on a Nikon 880.2 ) Indoor pictures are awful . With less light , the focus errors increase . Even more importantly , the " grain " is awful ( like using an ISO 1600 film ) . The " auto " modes set the ISO to 400 ( max ) , where grain is the worse . When I override this ( ISO = 100 ) , I can reduce the grain , but the dumb camera doesn't compensate for the change in film speed , so I end up with very dark pictures . Finally , all of my indoor pictures have the white balance heavily skewed toward red / yellow . The amount I have to " push " my pictures with the computer afterwards is tremendous . 3 ) The User Interface .. this is a non-trivial device to master . I probably have invested over 20 hours of experimenting to try to master this camera . One can just use the " Auto " modes , but then one is stuck w / very mediocre to poor pictures ( worse than my old 1-Mpix cameras ) . And if one was to use their famous " Scene " mode , it takes almost 20 seconds before you are ready to take the picture ( 10 seconds to power up , 10 seconds to navigate / select the Scene menus ) . And the manual overrides are very difficult to master . For example , to set the ISO , one holds down one of 4 buttons while moving the zoom in / out . 4 ) Lots of other annoyances , which make this camera frustrating to use everytime I pick it up . In a typical social situation ( trying to capture the memories ) , perhaps only 20 % of my pictures , w / the Nikon 880 , are keepers . With my older Olympus D600 ( 1 M-pix ) , I would get 80 % good pictures in similar situations . I bought the Nikon 880 through the internet , so I don't have the option of returning it . Why did I buy it .. I thought it was the best bang for the buck . Note : when comparison shopping for price , always always add an additional $ 150 to the base price of the 880 to account for the charger , the rechargeable battery , and a larger flash card . This camera will eat a $ 12 disposable CR5 battery in under an hour . If I had to do it again , I would have bought the G1 . This assessment is based upon playing w / a friends camera , and based upon my personal bias toward performance . My 2nd choice might have been the Kodak 4800 ( no 1st hand experience , but my sense is that this is a fairly easy-to-use point-and-shoot that would produce good pictures using their auto modes ) . Hope this review helps . Since I am stuck w / the 880 , I will be publishing my preferred settings for this camera on some of the news groups in the near future .  
1	  Prior to buying the TV we had a 27 " CRT TV that lasted 19 years . So we decided to buy a new TV since it was getting old . So in 1/17/2004 we bought a 40 " Projection TV ( R40W46 ) with a 2 years extended warranty . The TV has been performing great and we have been very happy with it until just last week when we noticed " blue shadows " all over the screen . After looking over the manual and adjusting the convergence , no success . To fix this TV outside of its warranty will cost over $ 1,000 dollars , and with prices on TV 's dropping it makes no sense to send it in for repair . It has basically become a disposable TV . We are very disappointed that our TV has only lasted 3 years . I 'm sending it to Goodwill . I 'm very disappointed that Zenith will not stand behind their products . My only mistake was not researching Zenith TVs prior to buying since I had full faith in the brand . I found other people on the internet with the same exact problem ! I 'm sorry to say this was my last Zenith TV .  
2	  This works ! It removed smears that an alchohol cleaning was only able to dissolve and spread evenly over my lens . This pen removed all residue and left my lens spotless .. it 's really amazing .  
1	  I don't know if the copy I purchased was bad , but the sound quality was just terrible . There was a hiss sound present during all recordings that really starts to drive you nuts when you want to listen to a recording . I was driven to purchase this recorder due to the Sony name and I became tired of using my MP3 player with a built in recorder as my conference recorder . Long story short , I 'm going back to the MP3 player as my recorder . The initial purchase price was lower and the sound quality of the recordings is stellar in comparison .  
2	  the company sells two main products for this area , dark color and light colors .. for dark color is basically a sticker that you print , and peel , then iron on , printout on front , peeled side back sticking to shirt ; for light , it is printed in reverse , no peeling , you iron the printed side directly to the shirtin theory , great idea , but one thing is they should first rename the products , dark should be simply iron on stickers , and light should be iron on transparent print out ; because that ` s really what you are doing .. if you printed an image with a white background , and let ` s say you iron this to a light green shirt , then background would stay white for DARK , and be transparent for the LIGHT product .. hope this is making senseanyways , the reason for the horrible rating is because the LIGHT product bleeds ink after the first wash , and everything is cracked and crinkled ; i looked online , tried everything , called support , they were cool , sent another package to try again ; ok , so i take my ruined shirt and try the back side this time , iron it on , looks great , let it sit one day , wash inside out , comes out cracked and bleeding b4 i decide to hang dry or tumble drysave your money , get the DARK product , its more expensive , but it works  
1	  I try to use this cable whit my lcd and it burnt my video card , i think was the cable was wront , but what i con do now .. i lost my card . i cant recomende it  
1	  I 've had this camera for a couple of years now and though it has never taken very good photos , it was good enough for the snapshots I take ( not much of a photographer ) though quite pricey at the time I bought it . I have never used it much but in the last year it intermittently refuses to turn on . It doesn't matter if I have fresh batteries in it or not . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't . If I take the batteries out and put them back in that will sometimes get it to work . Regardless , Kodak knows about the problem as I am not alone with this issue but they are doing nothing about it . Frankly , I think Kodak has terrible low end and mid range products ( I also have a Kodak AIO that I spent a fortune on that is hardly used and needs new printheads ) and their customer service reps are in denial . I 'm not sure why they call it " support . " Once upon a time when I was young Kodak had one of the best reps around but not anymore . I will never buy their products again . I suggest that you get a better camera from Sony or Cannon . They 're better quality for your money .  
2	  If you like tiny mp3 players then this is probably the best one out there . The set up was easy . I use the Real One player with the Panasonic add-on to transfer files . I don't care about features like FM radios , etc . so this player has all the features I need . I haven't had any problems transferring MP3 and WMA files that I have downloaded or ripped . The sound quality is good and it is definitely loud enough . I love being able to stuff it in my pocket so it is available when I need it . The playing time is a big plus too . I usually get more than 8 hours off the rechargeable battery and about a week of use if I use the carrier with the AA-battery . With SD card prices slowly dropping , I 've been buying 256MB SD cards so I can get hours of songs on a single card . The only complaint I have is that sometimes the display gets out of sync with what is actually playing .  
2	  First off let me say that reviewer J. Burke is either clueless or got a bad monitor . I love mine . The colors are clear and bright and image is clear and smooth in games like Battlefield 2 . Text looks great too , as I am a web designer and programmer and look at code often . I also have the 930B at work which is also a very good LCD display . Overall , I think Samsung is top notch . Between work and home I 've been around 8 Samsung LCD 's and not a single one had a bad pixel . My only complaint is that samsung needs to stop being cheap-skates and include a DVI cable in the box .  
1	  This is the correct product but for some reason , it won't program to my car . I have the exact same one ( but older ) and it will unprogram and reprogram , but this remote won't work at all . Caution !  
2	  I love the large amount of space on this card . I 'm not constantly downloading . My kids use it for taking videos with their cameras and it still lasts a long time . I may need more memory for my computer though !  
1	  I love the design of this stand , and the material its made from . But I 've had some major problems with slippage when putting my macbook pro on it . It won't stay on the stand at all = (  
2	  well , there are many things to look at when buying a mp3 player1 ) Sound , well it is what you bought it for isnt it ? the sound isnt Perfect , but its very good And gets far better if you dont use the headphones that came with it . 2 ) Battery life , 14 hours is what its rated but i normally get around 10-12 this is probably because i like to browse pictures and watch the occasional video on it every so often , but this isnt a huge problem since i can easily charge it every night when i go to bed3 ) Looks , as everyone knows its absolutely beautiful . By far the most stuning mp3 player out there4 ) ( because it plays video ) Screen quality , the screen on this device is Perfect , couldnt ask for anything better5 ) use , using this device is Incredibly simple , making playlists is also very simpleReally the bigest flaw in this is its battery life , Before buying this i had a Gmini 400 ( Archos ) and a HD1 ( sony ) and i like the ipod the best By far , if your bigest concern is battery life this is not the product for you , otherwise this is By far # 1  
1	  If you plan to use this camera in a medium to low light situation , please consider one of the cameras that has a ISO rating of 400 or 800 . Not having an optical zoom feature like other cameras , it is very difficult to zoom in on your subjects unless you walk up to them and stand just a couple of feet from them . In addition , under low light situations , the LED viewer is not able to show the images you are trying to take photos of . You are restricted to using the view finder to find what you are trying to take a photo of . I found out about this limited feature while attending a wedding reception . I was not able to see what I was trying to take a photo of unless I used the view finder and as a result , many of my photos show the bride and groom very far off in the actual photo . The camera takes wonderful photos outdoors and in limited flash photo situations so it is a great camera for those types of photos . As for indoor , low light photos , it may turn out to be a nightmare . Happy photo shooting .  
1	  I bought this cable together with a 750GB harddrive for expanding my DirecTV 's HD DVR . According to forum search on internet , the HD DVR will accept external HHD connected via ESATA cable , and only works with ESATA cable . I bought the two said items both from Amazon ( Amazon , LLC ) . Amazon advertised this as ESATA cable . In reality , when the item arrived , both the flex-film package as well as the markings on the cable says SATA ; nothing on the package / product was labelled ESATA . Sure enough , when connected , the DVR did not recognize the external HDD . I then bought a ESATA cable from local BestBuy just to prove / dis-prove this - and sure enough , with the ESATA calbe from local store , the DVR recognizes the external HDD . Bottomline : This item is advertised by Amazon as ESATA , but it is not ESATA . I 'm gonna try and return this item . If Amazon reimburse in full , including shipping , I 'll change my rating to neutral . But as of now , I feel cheated ( and have evidence to prove I got cheated ) by Amazon .  
1	  they are nice , but full power , don't expect more than 2 miles ( yes 2 , no kidding and intensivly tested : same result as a 5w CB with a good car antenna ! ) . to that , is nice to remember that they need license and license cost is around 50 bucks , so include this doing your math . the range claimed will probably happen in the middle of the rocky M. desert .. I don't understand why the can't be a little bit more honest and , instead of writing " results may vary " write : works few miles range in town . Ashame !  
2	  The Canon PowerShot A460 Camera is everything that I had hoped for and the price was very good . However , I think that a wait of 19 days for delivery was excessive .  
2	  This device does exactly what I wanted . I own a HP tc4200 tablet pc that came without a dvd drive . This addition has enabled me to completely close the gap and it is extremely portable and convenient for travel . I strongly recommend .  
2	  Bought two of them for vacation to DC . When they arrived one was dead and would not even charge , contacted the seller and they sent a new one in 3 days . Both batteries work great , hold a long charge , and took the DC heat walking the streets for 7-9 hours a day for the entire week . Only had to recharge one time for each battery all week . Would buy again no issues or reservations !  
2	  I found this gorgeous little camera at a thrift shop completely broken and priced by someone who obviously had no clue what it was . I sent it to the Leica shop to get it fixed which cost several hundred dollars . For $ 260 ( which is what I ended up paying for it total ) , it was completely worth it . It 's stylish , it takes great photos , it 's tiny ; basically it 's perfect . But honestly , there 's no way it 's worth the full price new . The photos are really nice , but maybe I 'm spoiled by my DSLR , which takes photos whose quality easily rivals film . I mean , they 're just not that nice , if you get what I 'm saying . If you can find one of these cameras used , I say snap it up . But really , it 's not worth it 's price tag .  
1	  Not a good product , used it for a year only get 2 bars , end up I bought the Alfa AWUS036H . I got 4-5 bars !  
1	  Brand new out of the box . I pop the software CD in and it says " not compatible with my operating system " . I 'm on Windows 2k . There is no option on Kodak 's website to download the software using your faster internet computer ( only the setup file ) , to be able to install it on the slow dialup computer . That 's 45mb to download over dialup . Kodak has no option to send you the software on CD . Kodak tech support had no solution . This camera is the Z712 . I bought this as an upgrade from the z710 . The z710 has everything you need to work under Windows 2000 . Addendum 1/22/2008 : As it works out , the software that came with my z710 recognized the z712 for image transfer . So , I didn't need to spend 142 minutes doing a dial-up download . Lucky , eh ? Addendum 6/17/2008 : The battery that ships with this camera is not the recharge-able version . I bought the Docking station g610Kodak EasyShare G610 Printer Dockand found out after I brought it home and read the instruction book , it requires a specific battery . You need theKodak 8324154 KLIC-8000 Li-Ion Rechargeable Battery for Z612 Camera ( $ 25 on Amazon . ) or the equivalent battery versionKodak DLK-8000 Equivalent Li-ion Batteryby Lenmar ( $ 10 on Amazon . ) The z712 takes some amazingly detailed pictures ! Once in a while , when I 'm focusing in zoom mode 70mm , the screen will say processing for a several seconds . I just cross my fingers and hope the wildlife doesn't take off . My only complaint with the image quality , and I think this is generic to most digital cameras , bright sunlight on white washes out detail . Noticeable on subjects like sea gulls and egrets .  
1	  Unfortunately , this old model doesn't charge the iPod Touch 2nd Gen . The sound quality on these FM transmitters is terrible . I 'd say worse than 64k mp3 quality . It works though .  
2	  This is positively a great HD tv . All the positive feedback I read here is right on the money . I also found Eagle shipping to be very fast ( only seven days from shipping date ) and courteous . Setup was very simple and only a few picture adjustments needed to suit my taste . Also , Amazon refunded part of my payment after the price was reduced the day after I ordered the tv ( of course I had to request it ) without any hassle . Now that 's entertainment !  
2	  Since most of my photography is done indoors , this filter was purchased to protect my much more expensive lens from accidental scratching . The product comes in a nice plastic case with a foam insert , and mine was clean and clear upon arrival . It 's also important that this filter is multi-coated .. just like most nice lenses are . There 's no reason to throw an uncoated junky filter in front of a nice lens with coating !  
2	  Somewhat of a novice in this field I relied on recommendation of associate and some limited online product research prior to purchase . I am uniformly pleased with the product and all of it 's features , the design and user interface are clean and efficient . I had little trouble getting it up and running and it performs well in all modes .  
1	  PLEASE READ ! Hi im from Minnesota land of 10k lakes so most of us guys up here fish and hunt . I bought this Hawkeye fish finder to find a cheaper substitute for ice fishing instead of a vexilar i knew it was to good to be true I was hyped up to go ice fishing with this , the Hawkeye couldn't even find the depth or anything it said it was made for . Horrible device DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTgood luck to all you fishermen 's out there catch em walleyes kill em crappies .  
2	  I am a person who likes product quality and reliability , but I don't want to pay the " name tag " pricing ( in this case HP ) . After using refurbished cartridges that ruined my printer , I started using HP cartridges and had no problem since . To keep the cost down , I 'm using the Amazon Subscribe & Save program . The quality is right , and the price , too . Free shipping ( 2 days if you are a Prime member ) .. Works for me .  
2	  This case is great ! It protects the whole iPod without scratching it . The wheel protector is awsome . It 's touch sensitive and works perfect . It comes with everything you need to protect your iPod ; screen protector , optional belt clip , optional neck lanyard , and optional armband . The only problem is that the screen protector keeps shifting around and the cutout is not approximate . I just use plastic film to protect the screen . Other than that , the case is a great one , and it 's worth the money .  
2	  This is a very good case . Everything worked as advertised . I found it easy to install the components .  
2	  I really enjoy my Zune . Be careful that you don't leave it on while you are not using it or your battery dies and you don't know it .  
2	  I 've had this for over a year now and it still performs flawlessly . Just be sure to clean the rubber grommet and oil it up w / cooking oil after each cleaning . Keeping the rubber lubricated should last you a very long time .  
1	  I couldn't believe I wasted my money on this . 4 problems : 1 . Volume not good ( I listen to metal and it 's not even for classical , volume 's so low ) . 2 . The bass system is not good , most of beats sounded different from other players while others make me jumps up and down and blew my ears away , this one like knocking on the doors or tables in that case . 3 . It skips sometimes - skip protection .. okay .. 4 . slow as mofo when you press Previous Track or program the tracks . The tracks take about 2 - 5 secs to load the song out ..  
2	  This unit works well as units close the window and turn them into one-touch system , which also include a tool set the closing force to suit large and small carsNegativesThere is no stop system in case it senses a finger or object in the auto ups path it automatically stops  
1	  This is the worst camera I have ever owned in my life . I had a fuji 1.3 mega pixle camera that took better pictures than this one ! I have taken this camera on 2 vacations now , and both times I brought along my Olympus SLR film camera , and both times , the Olympus pictures are clearer , brighter and all but maybe 1 will work , with this stupid Sony Cybershot , I end up deleting 3/4 of the pictures because they are blury or have all kinds of funny things happening , the only pictures that do work with this camera is during the day time , or in bright lighting . On the first vacation I went on with this camera , my friend brought along her kodak 1 megapixel camera she got free and it turned out better pictures , as did my Olympus , on the second vacation I returned from today as I write this , I just downloaded my pictures , and deleted 2/3 's of them because they are so bad , the ones that came off my film camera are perfect ! My sister also has the exact same camera which she brought with her , and as I went through her pictures , same thing over 2/3 's of them didn't work , I would have just assumed I 'd gotten a defective camera if it was only my Sony that did not work , however hers didn't either , I would also assume perhaps it was myself that was the problem , however , I took a number of the exact same picture on this Sony as well as my Olympus ( as a back up and thank god I did ) and the pictures from the Olympus , as well as every other camera I have ever used , have come out fantastic , on this camera though , they come out horrible , so bad in fact that I 'm embarrassed to show people ! Believe me , if I hadn't gotten it free as a present I 'd be writing a nasty letter to Sony , as it is though my next camera I 'm saving up for and buying from a brand that does nothing but photography equiptment , therefore knows what they 're doing . Sony makes great TV 's and home entertainment systems , anything else I 've bought from them , or known someone who has , has been junk , their camera , their car stereos , their computers ! Sony should stick to TV 's and Home Theater , it 's what they 're good at , camera 's not so much , unless you 're looking for something cheap that you 'd only use in the day , even then I 'd recommend a disposable , they even work better than this camera !  
2	  This unit is not straight forward to install and undoubtedly Linksys Technical Support is deficient in its ability to support it . That said , once installed , the print server is a beauty . I print large documents several hundred pages long from time to time and whereas two other wireless units I tried fall over badly , this one just eats them up . The key thing is to to get the most up to date firmware : 6047 . This does not yet appear to be available from the Linksys site but can be obtained from ww . linksysinfo . org . Once that is installed , everything becomes much easier . Connect the unit up by cable to your router and install it , including setting the security . The new firmware supports WPA-PSK . Once everything is working , power it down and remove the cable connection . After a moment power it back up and the wireless connection will kick in . It is sensible to do all of the above in stages and check how you are doing but it is necessary to power the unit down and back up when changing from cable to wireless and vice versa . I hope this helps .  
1	  I 've owned two of these models , and neither has lasted more than a couple of years . I won't make this mistake again . They seem prone to electronic glitches , refusal to read discs , faulty disc tray mechanism , and poor programming . My most recent failed model ( bought in 2008 ) would frequently not recognize a disc that had been inserted and skip over it . If there were multiple discs in the tray on random play , sooner or later it would refuse to play some or all of the discs . Then this past month it began to turn itself on - that 's right , TURN ITSELF ON , with the display lighting up . I 'd hit the power button to turn it back off and within the hour it 'd be back on again . After a day or two of doing this it began to freeze up on discs , skip , and generally freak out , the display flashing random digits and messages the disc tray refusing to open , and generally refused to accept input from the control buttons . I finally pulled the plug to disconnect all the active input ; plugged it back in after a resting spell , and then was able to force enough response to free my CDs . I 'll shop more carefully for a replacement this time - I 'm finished with Onkyo .  
2	  The way I judge the Canon PIXMA MP510 is in the following manner : Cost of the ink refills , cost of the unit , speed to print in B & W and then color , scan quality versus speed and print quality , ease of setup , operation , and continued use , versus life of the All-in-One Photo Printer . I have had the Canon PIXMA MP510 All-in-One Photo Printer for three months and can say it is one of the best All-in-One Photo Printers I have ever used . This is the third canon printer and fourth multi-purpose device I have owned . I expect to get at least three years out of the unit . One reviewer mentioned that the unit was loud when started and this is correct . I however get around this by allowing the unit to stay on twenty four hours a day . The unit enters a hibernation phase and all that is on is , the two front panel lights allowing for quick use when needed . It was easy to set up , put the ink in , and operate . I can copy with two key strokes and can scan-email or scan-store any document . The scanner is not the fastest in the world but for the home office and the money it does the job . The scans are sharp and adequate to my needs . The software that came with the unit is also simple to set up and use . When I was looking at the various manufactures and devices on the market canon stood out as having economical and good devices . The Canon PIXMA MP510 All-in-One Photo Printer has met or exceeded all my expectations and needs .  
2	  The GPS and TomTom software works great in both US and Europe and has helped to quickly find a destination . Using the Wifi capabilites and browsing the internet at the airport and in the hotel has worked well , although some pages do not get fully displayed as Flash is not installed . Really enjoy using it .  
2	  I bought this for my Sony camera and have had no problems whatsoever with it ! It was a great deal , too !  
1	  I had this router for several years in a small apartment . Had many problems with dropped connections and router needing to be power cycled . Replaced it with aLinksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router ( Compatible with Linux ) with firmware upgraded to DD-WRT which performs flawlessly . I regret spending so much time and effort trying to get the Netgear WGR614 to work reliably .  
1	  the case is beautiful yes , but its horrible to arrange wires in ! i had a modular PS and still have cables everywhere ! and you can't really stash them anywhere so they are all over the place . Also i had to remove one of the fan mounts on the back of one of the places that holds drives in order to get my video card to fit inside . def wouldn't get this thing again if i would of known how bad it was with room on the inside . Also had a hard time getting my MB inside it correctlypretty much its a nightmare . don't expect to have it standing on display unless you plan on drilling holes for cables  
2	  I just got this for my work , and have set up using the web-browser based setup interface . It 's a bit flaky user interface , but gets the job done and is straight forward . Also , it seems to have lower sync rate than SMC 802.11b Barricade wireless access point I have used before with my Netgear MA401 card . It takes a while for the computer to recognize ( like 20 seconds instead of instantaneous ) that it is receiving a good signal after waking up from a standby . The signal strength is excellent , though I will be increasing that with their optional signal booster WSB24 . Tech rep said that 802.11b signal booster also works fine with this 54G access point to increase the signal strength because both protocols use the 2.4GHz range , which is a definite plus if you need good coverage . I will be getting their 54mbps card within a couple of days , so this will be interesting , as I am using the Netgear MA401 card right now and experiencing this slight delay in re-synchronizing after a wake up from standby . I 've had problems making Macintosh to access with the WEP enabled ( both 64bit and 128bit ) , but may be likely that is a Mac problem . All in all , it is so far an excellent value , should be interesting to see what the signal booster and a 54G card should do in addition to this access point ..  
2	  This is my first LCD monitor but I am very pleased with this purchase . The quality of the image is very good , with high contrast and brightness . For video , it doesn't have those ghosting effects that you see in slower LCD monitors . The images are sharp and the display works great at 1280x1024 @ 60Hz ( its native resolution ) .  
1	  It works fine , I can't compare it to the ipod but I 'm very disappointed in the lack of accessories available . I would like to find a car adapter so I can listen to it in the car longer than the short time the battery lasts . I have found nothing available ! Amazon lists it as discontinued and when I called Creative , they told me it was discontinued and they have no idea when a new one will be available . There is no cradle available either . Go into a store like Best Buy and you 'll see a wide variety of accessories available for ipod . Ipod cost more but I 'm very sorry I didn't buy one now since it seems that Creative is doing nothing to make accessories availably .  
2	  I received the Scarlet Red Bodysuit and the Jet Black Bodysuit for Kindle Fire in the same order , along with a Boxwave stylus . All at a discount , on sale and the offer for the stylus had a discount for the Bodysuit . Under $ 13.00 for all three . Free shipping , because the original cost added up to the minimum $ 25.00 with Amazon , pre-discounts . I thought I got a terrific deal ! The cover slips right onto my Fire with little effort , like jelly shoes for the Fire . The edge designs on the back are grippy , while the center of the back is smooth . On the face side of things , the Bodysuit just goes around the edge , so you see the full face of the Fire , which is why I wanted the covers . The top has speaker cutouts and the bottom has the cutout to allow for charging and earphones , along with the on-off button . I chose two colors because of the great deal and I like change every now and then . The Scarlet Red is kind of jelly clear , in the way you can see through it a little . Mine is not the dark red that it looks on my Mac . Kind of more a Candy Apple Red . Still , cute and femme . The Jet Black is solid when held up to light . The grippy edges are a matte black , with the center of the back is a glossy patent kind of look . I would suggest a screen protector to go with the Bodysuit . And maybe a slip case for a little buffer if you tote your Fire around like I do . I do have a cover that is more " book " style , but it does not give me the realty I want for the face surface . The Bodysuit adds a little coverage in a slim , sleek sort of way . I am not sure how much " drop protection " the Kindle Fire would have , with hopes I don't find out . I am pleased with my purchases and I hope my review helps someone with their Kindle Fire needs .  
1	  Good cable , no interference for 25 ' ! BUT the right channel doesn't work after 1 week . So NO don't buy , spend money on a bit better cable .  
2	  I was looking to camera that will be in the pocket to take the kids pictures . So the main requirements were : 1 . Fast startup2 . Fast picture taking3 . Good performance in slow ISO . 4 . quality5 . lightweightGreat value for the money . Highly recommended .  
2	  The purpose of the tube is to give you more zoom power from farther away , though you do have to be within about ten feet of your subject ( depending on you chosen lens ) , which is a pretty good range in my opinion . So if you 're looking for an alternative to a macro lens , this is for you . It doesn't affect image quality even a little . Hope this review was helpful to you .  
2	  A quality extension lens . I am normally leery of " add on " lens as far as quality go . However this lens is well made and gives a very good image quality .  
2	  I researched cameras for weeks relentlessly until I finally bought this camera . I read probably 300 reviews and articles about different cameras . I was starting to lose my mind , literally . The problem is , for as many good things people have to say about different cameras , there are always plenty of negative comments that can scare you away . One person says the camera is too heavy , another says it is light .. one says the pics look like crap , another says they are beautiful .. Well , I finally pulled the trigger and bought the FZ50 , and I can honestly say that it was a very wise decision . I am a novice at best with cameras . I had no problem turning this camera on for the first time and immediately go right into taking great pictures . The auto mode allows me to do that . The pictures are crisp and clear even when blown up in to bigger sizes . The colors are wonderful . Yes , the pics are not quite up to the level of some dslr pics I 've seen , but they are wonderful nontheless . The camera looks awesome , and feels great in your hands . It is a good size and weight . All of the controls are easily accessed right at your fingertips . One aspect of the camera that was impotant to me , but may seem silly , is that once it is focused , when I push the button down to take the picture , it clicks , and takes it right away . ( unless you are using flash .. ( about a second delay ) ) this is very important to me because I cannot tell you how many great pics I 've missed of my dogs or kids because my old camera didnt take the pic until 3 secs after I depressed the button . It was very frustrating . The best part of the camera is , like I said , you can take great pics right out of the box with the auto mode , but the camera has so many other modes and features to learn , that I can see myself learning new and exciting things and growing as a photographer throughout years to come . The camera really begs to be learned and challenges you to go out and take cool pics . The FZ50 is really a fun , easy ( if you want it to be ) camera and I suggest it to anyone who is looking for a camera in this price range . You will not regret your decision . Here is a great website that I found where you can go to see TONS of pics taken with only the FZ50 : $U$ FZ50 group hold contests from time to time for best pictures too .. hopefully you see one of mine there someday !  
1	  THIS ITEM WAS DELAYED IN SHIPPING AND WHEN IT FINALLY ARRIVED THE BOX HAD CORRECT PART NUMBER ON IT , YET , ACTUAL PART ENCLOSED HAD A DIFFERENT PART # / WAS NOT THE ITEM WE ORDERED , THUS , NOT COMPATIBLE W / OUR MODEL CAMERA . SO WE CANNOT REVIEW OR RATE .  
1	  This cable stopped working after I plugged it in to test it , once . I used it to attach a mobile mic to my camera . however , after putting it away after the first test , it started making a very loud humming noise . So loud nothing else but yells could be heard . Don't buy , too many people had the same experience for this one to be a single lemon . Go with a different brand .  
1	  BAD - Choppy AVI playback , contrasty screen with NO shadow detail , cheap plastic feel , no random arrangement of slideshow capability , the auto-on auto-off feature would be great if it didn't turn on with the audio volume set at 60 % no matter what it was set on before it turned off , no battery , cheesy slideshow transitions ( no fades ) . GOOD - Easy setup , WIfi works with a PC ( not with a mac ) .  
1	  I was anxious to get this in the mail because I wanted to enjoy cook infrared effect . Among the effects represented was the ability to " see through " clothing when photographing people . Well I am here to tell you that the filter is so dark that it is almost opaque . If I put this on my camcorder 's lens ( and I have a very sensitive camcorder ) it makes the recorder completely useless . The screen is blacked out . In strong sunlight you can see just barely any image in the monitor . Don't waste your time on this totally worthless item . Does not even deserve one star . Unfortunately I waited too long to open the package after I received it so now I am stuck with this turkey .  
1	  Very poor reception . I had the speakers not 20 feet from the base and they would loose the conection and put out very loud static . I 'm returning mine .  
1	  One has to apply a lot of pressure when labeling a disk . Even when that is done , the colors look faint . Buyers Beware !  
2	  At various office stores USB 2.0 cables cost upwards of $ 35.00 - I got this one with gold connectors , for much less , and shipping was super-fast . The most important thing , when I used it to connect my printer / scanner to my computer , it worked like a charm . I 'd buy more cables from Tripp Lite without hesitation .  
1	  First of all , I made my own mistake because I thought it would charge my iPod and it was really just an FM transmitter that uses the audio jack of the iPod . But the reason for the 1 star is that once plugged in to the car & iPod , there was terrible feedback any time I touched my iPod or the cord of the transmitter . This one 's going back . I do say kudos to Amazon for having such an easy returns process !  
2	  The enclosure keeps your drive cool which is what really matters . However , it is loud .. Also I have vibration problems that create even more noise . I 've found that folding a piece of paper up and sticking it under the front of the enclosure solves the vibration . After that its great .  
2	  I generally use my headphones in a home recording studio , so I don't use them often , but I use them pretty hard . These phones offer very good sound quality and excellent isolation ( they 're the best phones I 've had for recording drums - I can hear the music over the drums without having to blast the volume too much ) . With the good passive isolation comes a little toll in the form of weight , but I find them quite comfortable for long sessions . The weight actually makes my other , lighter phones feel a little insubstantial in comparison . The one drawback to me is the coiled cable gets twisted and tangled , and doesn't appear to be easily replaceable . I won't try to offer a lot of insight into the finer details of soundstaging , accuracy , clarity , etc . ( aside from a somewhat generic " they sound really good " ) but they do an excellent job for what I need . I will probably replace my other phones with another pair of these sennheisers .  
2	  I enjoy a charger separate from the camera . This one works exactly as advertised . It is a good idea to have at least one spare battery to take full advantage of the charger . One battery can be charging while the other is in use .  
1	  Terrible-waste of money . Am used to buying from Amazon & being happy , so did not savereceipt-not worth sending back-not worth keeping-catches in VCR & what records is staticy - never worked from day 1 .  
1	  UPDATED REVIEW - These shouldn't be worn more than 30 minutes at a time . Spend $ 100 and get some great headphones . You WON " T regret it . I regret getting these . Everybody says headphones make such a big difference . You don't believe them until you have good headphones . These are pretty comfortable but I wouldn't rely on wearing them for more than a few hours at a time . The top of them that sits on your head could use a little padding but I 'm a wuss so that 's not a big deal . The sound is great in my opinion . Don't know why they have a music - movie switch on BOTH ear phones but they do .. I don't change the setting but maybe it matters . Overall a good purchase . I know the cord is SUPPOSED to be long but honestly it 's annoyingly long . Not a reason not to get it , but you 've been warned .  
1	  I purchased this router a while ago . After installing it and following the setup instructions , I found out the router wasn't obtaining an IP address from the cable network . I tried both using the router 's MAC address , and making the router " clone " the PC 's MAC address ; none of them worked . Then I upgraded the router 's firmware to its latest version ; that didn't help either . At first , I thought the issue had to do with my cable company , but after reverting to my original configuration ( PC directly connected to the cable modem ) , the DHCP problems were solved . Checking in Netgear 's forums and in some other sites around the Internet , I 've found many customers with similar issues . I decided to discontinue using the router , and to purchase a Linksys WRT54G , which has been working flawlessly . Think twice before purchasing this Netgear router .. for the same money , you 'll be able to find a better product .  
1	  I don't know if it is because I live in a large city with very few available frequencies .. but the quality of sound sucks . No problem if listening to book .. but for music it 's not worth it at all . A tip for those who buy this : Setup is confusing if you use iTunes .. you just need to copy the ipod files to your PC and manually add them to your playlist . In the end , I just spent $ 200 at Al & Ed 's autosound and put a pioneer sterio into my car that accepts an auxilary input from an iPod . Well worth it .  
1	  I just got this cable . My first problem was that the CD that came with it had no drivers for en EnV VX9900 phone . After I found the drivers on the web , I found out that this cable will not charge the phone when it is connected to the USB port .  
2	  I used iGuidance 1.0 for the Pocket PC for over 4 years before I got the Garmin n & uuml ; vi 360 . I loved the iGuidance but the Garmin n & uuml ; vi 360 blew me away ! Accuracy-The n & uuml ; vi is very accurate ; it has yet to fail to bring me to my destination . However , I 've encountered a few instances where an address or road wasn't in the n & uuml ; vi database - and I have the most current ( 2009 ) maps . In such cases , your best bet would be to simply enter an adjacent or nearby location into the n & uuml ; vi . Directions-The software lets you know how far ahead your next turn is when you 're within between about . 1 to . 5 miles . It says something like " In . 1 miles , turn left onto Broadway " and a few hundred feet before your turn , it omits the information on the distance before your turn and simply says " Turn left onto Broadway . " I wish it used feet instead of miles when specifying distances . 2 mile ( 1056 ft ) or less but it 's a minor complaint . The software gives you the directions for two successive turns that are very close together ( say , 300 feet apart ) all at once to make sure you have ample time to respond to the second turn that immediately follows the first . For example , " Take exit 70 , then keep left " , or " Turn right , then immediately turn left . " However , it may occasionally notify you of a turn a little late , which results in you missing the turn . Thankfully , this doesn't happen very often . If you do miss a turn , however , the software recalculates a new route very quickly ( within a couple of seconds ) ! Auto-Off / Resume Function-My Garmin is a permanent fixture in my car . I leave the car adapter permanently hooked up to the unit . What I really love about it is it automatically turns off when the external power supply is lost . What this translates to is whenever I turn off my car engine , the unit automatically shuts itself off . When I start my car , the unit automatically fires back up . It gets better - it remembers your set destination when it turns back on and resumes giving you directions to your destination . This feature is handy for when I need to fill up on gas midway to a destination . After I 'm done filling up my tank , I start my car , at which point the GPS unit fires back up and immediately resumes giving me directions to my destination . Very cool ! This makes the Garmin n & uuml ; vi the perfect In-Car GPS solution ! Data Entry-The keys for entering addresses into the n & uuml ; vi are arranged alphabetically from A-Z , not in a QWERTY format . Personally , I find the tedium of having to hunt for letters in the A-Z format a real inconvenience and annoyance ! Lock It-You can lock your n & uuml ; vi with a 4-digit PIN . The package comes with 2 decals that state that your GPS unit is secured with a security code to deter would-be thieves from stealing the unit . Text To Speech The text to speech still sounds like it comes from a synthesized voice but it 's perfectly intelligible . Multi-Point Routing-Even though Multi-Point Routing is NOT an intended feature on the n & uuml ; vi 360 , it doesn't mean the n & uuml ; vi isn't _ capable _ of Multi-Point Routing . Here 's how it 's accomplished : Say , you want to go from point A to point D via point B and point C. ( i ) You want to first set the destination to point D. ( ii ) Then , once again , you set the destination a second time , this time to point C. You will receive the following prompt from the software asking " Insert as via point ? " , which essentially means : Do you want to overwrite the destination you 've set in step ( i ) , i.e. the point D destination or do you want to go to point D VIA point C. Answer YES . ( ii ) Yet again , set the destination a third time to point B. Answer YES when prompted whether you want to " Insert as via point ? " There you have it , the n & uuml ; vi is going to take you from point A to point D VIA points B and C. It 's a clumsy roundabout way of getting the n & uuml ; vi 360 to do Multi-Point Routing , but it can be done . Nice Extras - SD card SlotSince the unit can serve as an MP3 Player and a photo viewer , it has an SD card slot allows you to load mp3 and photos ( JPEG ) onto the unit . - MP3 PlayerThe MP3 Player is very basic . It has shuffle and repeat track / playlist . The unit will only read mp3 files in the root directory of the SD card ; it will not read mp3 files that are in a folder . It will , however , read playlist ( pls ) files , which can have their source from one or more folders / sub folders . There are other limitations to the mp3 player :( i ) you cannot delete tracks ( ii ) you cannot arrange / edit your playlistsTo edit / delete your tracks or playlists , you will need to do so in your computer , mobile device , or music device . - Picture ViewerYou can load your photos via the SD card slot and view it on the screen . - Bluetooth Phone HookupI 'm , unfortunately , still using a cell phone that 's doesn't have Bluetooth ( it 's one of those antiquated phones reminiscent of the cell phones from the 90 's ) so I 'm unable to test this feature . But I 'm able to tell you it 's a feature that allows you to hook up your phone to the GPS unit via Bluetooth so you can use the GPS unit as a handsfree console . Now , that 's pretty nifty . Conclusion-The Garmin n & uuml ; vi 360 is a very affordable In-Car GPS Solution . Apart from the cumbersome interface ( A-Z keys ) for entering your destination , I really don't have very much else to complain about it . Highly recommended !  
1	  After what seemed like months of hype in magazines , book reviews and NPR , I was chomping at the bit to read The Little Friend . About half way through the book I began to wonder if all those critics had been given a different edition to read . The story idea is interesting , but the characters are wooden and the prose is awkward-a fine literary vocabulary , but decidedly lacking in finesse . I 'd recommend Swan by Frances Mayes as an alternate read .  
2	  This product was ideal ! It allowed me to keep the current Bose speakers and amp . Wiring was simple ! A must have if you have a factory Bose system !  
1	  TThe product I received does not have a standard Laptop USB connector on it but rather some more narrow but thicker connector to which I have not found a USB Port of any standard computer that it fits nor is it the same as the unit you purchase directly from APPLE . As such the units I have are on no value . Make certain you see the size and get written demonsions of unit when ordering . If you have to spend the money to return it to the Manufacucter it will most likely cost more than you paid for the unit in the first place . My recommendation is do not buy . Thus the rating of zero stars . the unit shipped does not even plug into the ciggaret lighter adaptor that they ship . It is correct and works with my factory product . If anyone in the companies quality control had tried even to put the peice together they would find that they are not correct .  
1	  I purchased this camera last summer . After about 2 weeks , the lens door started to make a clicking sound and stopped opening . I returned it to Casio for warranty repair . Called 8 weeks later , and learned that they had sent me a letter , which I never received . After two requests , they FAXed me a copy . It said that the camera had " corrosion , " which was not covered by the warranty . Repairs would be $ 135 ( cost was $ 200 ) . I had the camera returned unrepaired , and carefully opened it . There was no sign of corrosion anywhere inside ( examined it with a 10X lighted magnifier ) . I then exchanged E-mails with Casio Customer Service ( an admittedly nice lady ) . She said that all I could do was to send it back for another exam by the same techs as before ! I guess " the customer is always right " doesn't apply to Casio . Would not recommend this camera , or any other Casio product , based on this experience .  
2	  I could not find a replacement cartridge for my 12 year old HP LaserJet 4L in stores in this metropolitan area . I ordered through Amazon on December 8 in the run up to the Christmas rush . Nevertheless , I received the cartridge well before Christmas . Although Shipping and Handling was a bit steep at $ 5.99 for Standard Shipping , I was very satisfied with the result .  
2	  This card works with the LG VX8600 mobile phone . No extra steps or anything needed , just put it in and ready to sync up music with computer .  
1	  I invested quite a bit in storage boxes like these , some with fancy wood paneling and pull-out drawers . But they all had the same fatal flaw-slots . The pictured Atlantic storage box holds 45 CDs , as many as I 've frequently collected in two months . Even if you decide to use such a box for holding the CDs of , say , just one artist-Frank Sinatra-they 're equally problematic . I would need three of these to hold my Sinatra CD collection . Moreover , if I don't alphabetize or organize them in some way-chronologically , for example-I still won't be able to go instantly to the CD I 'm looking for . And here 's where the problem lies : every time you add a new CD to box , you have to refile the entire collection because of those darn slots . Moreover , due to the slight warpage of jewel cases over time , they can be a real nuisance to re-fit to those very same slots . Forget about trying to saw the slots out of the plastic . I tried that . All of my slotted storage devices have gone into the garbage . Even plain shoeboxes are an infinitely better bet .  
1	  I bought this mouse to use with my Dell Inspiron E1705 with integrated bluetooth . The computer recognized the mouse right away , however I could not install the software included with the mouse . The good : on / off buttom , long battery life , comfortable design . The bad : As pointed out by other reviewers , the device ' goes to sleep ' way too often . You have to jiggle and wait for the mouse to be activated almost constantly . This becomes quite annoying when you are working . I ended up returning it because I could not stand it . - Note added on 4/13/2006After returning the mouse I contacted Logitech and asked if there was a way to disable the stand-by mode . Here is what they had to say ( I haven't tried since I no longer have the mouse ) : Thank you for your recent inquiry about your Pointing Devices . I understand that the Logitech V270 mouse goes to sleep mode too often . Please note that the mouse will go to sleep mode if it is not used for few minutes to save the battery life . If you move the mouse or press the click button of the mouse , then it will come up from the sleep mode and then work as normal . However , if you would like to disable the mouse entering the stand-by mode , then refer to the following steps : a . Right click on My computer and select Properties . b . Click on Hardware Tab . c . Select Device Manager . d . Click the + sign next to Mice and other pointing device . e . Right click on the mouse you are using and properties . f . Click on Power Management Tab . g . Enable Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power . h . Click OK .  
1	  The VIZIO HDTV stopped working and I waited three months for someone to call me to repair it . Meanwhile they sent me emails that I should wait and be patient . The phone number for cutomer service is not toll free and you wait on the line so much to talk to someone . I returned it to the store .  
1	  This item is junk . The sound is fair but it won't play ten minutes without pausing . I tried three different I-Pods and they were all the same . I saw the reviews that other people had the same problem but figured " What are the odds that this is more than an isolated problem ? " Pretty good . It was going to cost $ 16 to ship it back for a replacement but with the reviews these things are getting the chances are my replacement would be junk too . Stay away from this product .  
2	  Alright , for those of you out there ( like me ) who do not have an option to play your mp3 files in your , but to buy something like this ( or those 20th century cassete adapter ) here it goes . This product is amazing . In other words , it works right out of the box . It 's easy to set up and get going . However , it is a bit ( tiny ) tricky to change both the radio station and the device while driving . Is it good for going to and from work ? YES . Does it hav lots of static ? Maybe , depends where you live ( I guess ) . I live in a New York suburb and yes the stations are still crowded , but mine works best at 88.1 and 88.5 , I guess you jsut need to find you rsweet spot . What do I use ? I use my blackberry 8330 . It sounds clear and the quality is very dependable . Best is when I get a call and I simply hit the " talk " button and walla there , through the car speakers is the person 's voice . Is it worth the price ? Anytime . I went to Radio Shack and they had their brand one for $ 35 . So it will beat their price anytime . I , an educated shopper like you , would recommend this product to anyone . After all , what do others expect for teh price ?  
1	  I was hopeful the Targus Hub would be able to handle a keyboard , wireless mouse and speakers , but the hub is not capable of keeping up with signals . The mouse slowed and was clunky at best . If you need any speed and reliability with several devices this is NOT the product to purchase .  
1	  This company does not live up to their promises when supporting their products . Once they sell you a product , you are essentially on your own if if breaks or does not work as advertised . I do not recommend purchasing ANY of their products . They will leave you high and dry !  
1	  This All - in - one product was bought to be my home office scanner and copier and was doing fine until it ran low on one color ink cartridge . Wow .. this shut down the entire machine . I could no longer scan or do a BW copy .. nothing ! I contacted Epson , and was told they had determined the primary function of this product was a printer and designed " safeguards " to shut the machine down if the ink got low . When I stated my point that it 's the customer 's decision what the primary function would be , Epson responded by telling me that I could purchase another brand if I was unhappy with their product . I was , and I did . Epson charges almost $ 100.00 for replacement ink sets . Another Epson rip off , in my opinion .  
1	  I went to a sporting goods store , bought a true water proof carry bag thats twice the size and was half the price . Now my Dig . Rebel , PLUS a second point and shoot dig . camera , 2 lenses , Canon 's 420 flash , multi filters , charger and cleaning products fit with room to spare . Don't rush out to purchase this bag , you 'll regret it .  
2	  This is a great camera , I have had it a couple of years now and it has been great . Battery life is outstanding , sturdy build and great options . The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is ( a ) it does not have a manual focus button on the case ( its buried in menus ) and ( b ) it does not have a memory card slot . I believe the new models have addressed both of these issues .  
2	  So much has already been written about the iPod that I need not mention about its sound quality and other functions . I will just suggest anyone who wants to buy an iPod to go to Apple 's website and checkout the ' refurbished ' iPods too . They go at a real low price but are still backed by Apple 's 1 year warranty . Although I haven't bought one for myself , but consider this , 2 gigs nano for 199 $ , and a 30 gig ' refurbished ' iPod with video playback and Apple 's warranty , 199 $ . And since they are refurbished by Apple itself , one shouldn't worry about the quality . Give it a thougth guys .  
2	  We own 3 pairs of these speakers ! One pair is above our patio deck for when we sit out for dinner or cocktails . We have one pair aimed out to the backyard for our pool parties . We also have one pair over the driveway for late nite basketball games and the firepit ! They look great and sound AWESOME !  
1	  VERY VERY VERY Dissapointing . Is this what MICROSOFT came up with to compete with IPOD ! ? IPOD is 100 times better . my brother has one he bought around the time first news came out that Microsoft was gonna release the Zune to compete and even that IPOD is better . Don't waste your money . Get an IPOD . TRUST ME .  
1	  this thing has so much static it 's not even funny . I have heard my neighbors phone conversations . Took it back and got a much better and cheaper one .  
2	  I don't know why I 've read so many negative reviews regarding this product , but I had it and the supporting PC card configured and working in 15 minutes , including the time it took to get it out of the box . The Linksys Wireless router ( ver 2 ) and PC card ( ver 3 ) on a Dell Notebook with Windows 2000 Professional is working just fine and all over my three story house .  
1	  This unit was purchased on Amazon and supplied by a reseller . The modem was pretty easy to set up , worked for a while , then kept resetting itself . I returned the unit . Three weeks later I 'm still trying to get my refund from Amazon 's supplier .  
2	  I must admit I was very weary of buying this product . I had first bought something similar ( not brand name ) in a local Best Buy and was so incredibly disappointed I returned it to the store 10 minutes later . Basically I promised myself this would be the last time I try something like this . Obviously the title gives way to my amazement . I 'm so glad I took a chance , I really was about to give up on listening to the MP3 player in my car . The sound is INCREDIBLE . I come from an area ( virginia beach , va ) that has many radio stations and the pretuned one this dock came with worked perfectly . The only down side to the sound is the bass on certain songs . I believe that has to do with my specific sound equipment in my car though , therefore I still give this product 5 stars . The bass is easily fixed through the player , and obviously your own sound system in your car . I 've found a great medium . The neck is very flexible . After a short while , it 's true what they say , it just doesn't seem to stand up-right anymore . In order to fix this problem I got a small square of velcro , attached it to the back of the dock and another side to my car , and voila ! It stays perfectly in place without looking trashy in anyway . Then again , my car 's interior is black .. This product also comes with a handy belt clip . If you didn't like the plastic case and velcro the MP3 player originally came with , you 'll DEFINITELY love this instead . I take the player out of the car , and use the belt clip when I 'm working out at the gym . Along with the belt clip , are some rubber sockets to help the player better plug into your adapter , which leaves little worry in adapter size difference from car to car . I must also make note that this player DOES NOT charge the battery to the MP3 player . However , even if the battery is dead , if you plug it in , the MP3 player will manage to play perfectly . Also , the version I got here , on amazon , does not run your car 's battery . It says clearly on user guide " Auto Off : turns off when there is no audio input for 4 minutes " . Therefore , you do not have to worry about it draining your car 's battery . If you 're still worried , there are " auto-off " options in the MP3 you can customize to turn off after a certain amount of idle time . Many people also complain about how the backlight never stays on . This is confusing to me because it makes me wonder if they really have ever explored their MP3 player 's menu . Once again , the option for how long the backlight stays on is in the player 's menu , and there is an option for " never turns off " . Overall , I 'm very pleased with this product . I cannot explain just how happy I am over the quality . This purchase is definitley worth your time and money and I do not see how anyone couldn't be satisfied .  
2	  Have not had a chance to use the adapters yet , but I 'm sure that they will work fine . Product arrived much faster than expected . Will buy as much as possible through Amazon .  
1	  This printer , scanner , fax , and copier has compatibility issues with Windows 7 . I had to go to Cannon website to find drivers . It matters if you have 32-bit or 64 bit as well . Hooking this product up and using it was a nightmare . * Not even a year later , I am back on Amazon looking to purchase another copier , scanner , and fax machine . It is crunch time and the expensive toner is leaking everywhere . In addition , it is jammed and does this often when it gets hot . Again .. run for the hills and save your money !  
1	  I can't use the battery in my digital camera , I think the problem is the 1350 mAh of capacity and the charger don't charge other brand of this type of batteries . I still spend money in non rechargeable batteries .  
1	  Well , in the end I found this to be a disappointing product . Though all features worked , every couple of weeks I must reset the router to regain wireless service . I 've tried using different channels , but it always drops eventually . I did not have this problem with my older netgear router ( though it was only a 802.11b router ) . I 've recently purchased a Netgear WGT624 to see if it stays up longer . I have not tried the recently updated firmware ( late october release ) , but the release notes do not mention any updates concerning wireless connection reliability .  
2	  * UPDATE * Tripp Lite bought out Keyspan - I received a new unit within a month and it works great ! Much better Customer Service Now . * Original Reveiw * Unit has great sound and functions well . However , the batteries were only lasting 4-5 days with little or no use . I sent the unit back to Keyspan two months ago for repair and I still do not have the unit back . I 'm getting the royal runaround ! In summary , a great product if you don't have a problem with it . Customer service is non-exsitant .  
2	  There 's really not much to review but I figured I would counter the other ( misguided ) review on this item . The charger works just as fine for powering the Zune while in the car . I pretty much leave my Zune in the car and this lets me do that without having to periodically bring it inside for charging . The part that goes into the cigarette lighter is rather large so take that into account if you have any kind of obstructions around your power socket . The only other thing I noticed that surprized me a little was that the Zune display stays on when connected to the charger and playing music . There 's nothing really wrong with that but I was just expecting the screen to go dark like it does when it is not connected to power . Oh , I also like the coiled cord which makes things a bit tidier than having a lot of loose cable cluttering up the console area . I recommend this product .  
2	  I went through the effort of writing a lengthy review on this camera , but apparently this site can't ensure the comments get posted , or won't bother to post it . It 's a great camera - way better than the previous models which are quite good . I give the camera 5 stars , and this site 3 stars . Doubt I will bother writing a review again . - annoyed  
1	  After 18 months at time the har drive make strange noises and its innaccesible . I have to unplug the power cord and plug it again for it to come back for a while . but after a couple of hour the same thing happens . Terrible product stay away from it  
2	  Does the job as advertised and I love it . Thinking of getting another one , since I run in 2 areas so I would need another one , but since it 's winter I have to postpone it a bit .  
2	  These speakers are very satisfactory unless you are some kinda of audiophile nut . Great value and they will impress most people , and yes there are better speakers but what a bargain ! I typically don't care for Sony products but Samsung doesnt make speakers .. Good choice for front home theather speakers . Note - Sony 's front channel speaker is also decent . Rear speakers not so much ..  
2	  This UPS is more than adequate for my needs . Like other reviewers here , I was annoyed at the audible alarm when power was lost in the middle of the night . Here is how to turn off the alarm . Works for Windows and * nix . Download and run the PowerAlert software from tripp-lite . Under the Settings>>Schemes section change it to Business Device Management System . On the Action section , select the Set Audible Alarm task . In the Parameters below change the Value to 3 . Then click Execute Command . No more alarm and a UPS with a cool blue LCD that provides battery backup for my computer , router , cable modem , and VOIP gizmo . In answer to one review below , a log of power events etc . is available in the Business Device of the software mode in the logs section .  
2	  Easy to install , not the loudest set of speakers , but they rock if you are close to them . I would suggest getting these if you need something that is a little better than 2.1 speakers or your headphones . Also , if you are looking for something to accommodate your movie watching on your computer this will work great . If you want to have your rear speakers far away I would get extensions for them . Have fun and enjoy a great cheap set of speakers .  
1	  I 'm a Photojournalist in Mexico , in my work borrow me a Mk IIN but the battery who came with the camera it was too old and lose the charge too fast . I think in buy one but here in Mexico are too expensive like 200 dlls or more and it 's impossible find a gereric . I order this item whit my family in usa , then they send me this to my house in mexico . i put to charge in my original canon charger and when i disconect one of the tiny tubes who came in the contact space broke 's and fall , the charger not charge de battery anymore , i try to fix it whit a cuprum litle tube for make contact and doesn't worki loose my mind and broke the battery ..  
1	  I have now had 2 different PhotoSmart printers and they are so awful andincompetently designed it is amazing to me that HP has not been sued in aclass action over false advertising . The C6180 says on the box it can do32ppm black and 31ppm color - this is simply A LIE . It would be lucky to getthat many BLANK PAGES through it in a minute . For simple black-and-whitepages of double-spaced text , on the other hand ( I just timed it ) it doesa maximum of THREE AND A HALF PAGES PER MINUTE . PERIOD . Copying likewise , MAXIMUM THREE POINT SEVEN PPM black-and-white double-spaced text . Hang on , blank pages ? I just tried it , copied 5BLANK PAGES in a blazing ONE MINUTE FOURTEEN SECONDS . After hitting the cancel button , you will wait a minimum of 15 seconds for theprinter to be ready for the next job . And every few printings it spends 20-30seconds clicking and whirring first , sometimes without indicating what it'sdoing , often saying it is in " Printer Preparation " . The ink runs out at aridiculous rate and it seems clear that the notion that splitting cartridgesinto 6 saves money is also a lie . If any color cartridge is out , the printerwill not print even a black-and-white job without you going physically tothe printer and hitting the OK button - EVEN IF YOU HAVE PRESSEDTHE " BLACK " COPY BUTTON TO START WITH . Want to turn off the printer ? You 'll wait a minimum of 20 seconds for itto shutdown . But that 's nothing to turning it on . Better just leave it onall the time because you will wait a full MINUTE AND FIVE SECONDSfor it to be ready to print . But that 's not all . The printer has a million buttons and menus , but nojob control whatever . There 's no way to bring up a screen saying what'sin the queue ( if there is one ) or even a description of the current job . The printer very often hangs inexplicably , and its little elaborate uselesscolor screen just says BUSY no matter what button you hit , though nothingis printing . Often when the ink is out , it does not indicate this on thescreen but just stops printing . Perhaps it is waiting for the computer userto acknowledge a dialog , but the screen shows nothing . Often enough youjust have to yank the plug out of the back of it . Also , once every few days , the printer inexplicably loses its wireless connection . It does not indicatethis on the screen anywhere . It just disappears from the wireless network . Have to shutdown , or preferably yank the plug since shutdown takes so long , and power up again , to recover the wireless connection . You thought that was all , didn't you ? But the FAX hardly works either ! Tried to receive a black-and-white low-res fax , waited several minuteswhile it said connecting and receiving , then it just said FAILED . Faxes , um , are not rocket science . I checked the phone connection to the sender'sfax and there was no static . Unbelievable . My experience with the older photosmart was the same . I am a computer engineerand if I had designed this product line , I would not be able to sleep atnight , I would take my own life . It is strange because my experience withDeskJets has been much better . If you want a printer that barely functions at all , and you want to rewardHP for lying outrageously to customers with PPM almost TEN TIMESSLOWER THAN ADVERTISED , by all means , buy any HP PhotoSmartprinter .  
1	  I received this camera as an anniversary gift from my company . After taking several pictures at different resolutions and downloading to my laptop , I realized how poor the quality of the pictures were . Very grainy to be 3.0 MP . I have a 1.0 MP Kodak Easyshare camera that could run circles around this camera any day . When I viewed the pictures for this Oregon camera , if I didn't know better I would say they were taken with a camera phone . All I can say is thank god I didn't spend any money on this thing !  
1	  For the short period of time my m : robe actually worked I found the following : Pro : Cool looks . Contra : Unreactive user interface-reaction to pushing a button takes forever . Camera is not much better than a cell-phone camera . Player doesn't integrate with MS Media Player . Olympus provides some sort of poor-man 's Media Player / iTunes application forcing you into reencoding your music collection . Now to the worst part , Olympus service : I dropped my m : robe from ~ 2ft hight while it was in its little pouch . It still played the music I had on it but any new songs would hang the system and only turning it off would help . This is where my troubles with Olympus ' tech-support began . Endless waiting in hot-lines , circular phone menues . I finally sent my m : robe in . Weeks of waiting . In return to my e-mail enquiries I received long form letters without any relevant information about the repair status . They have a website for registered customers that is supposed to show the repair status . Mine never changed . After three months and an other attempt at getting someone on the phone I found out that I was supposed to pay $ 160 repair . I had the m : robe returned unrepaired ( since they sell used for less than $ 200 ) . My m : robe was an expensive experiment . Stay away from it .  
1	  I would not recommend this card for use as your primary TV and / or even for recording video . Even with my Intel Core2 Extreme and 8GB of 800MHz RAM , this card produces choppy video . It may not be annoying to some , but it is to me . I would recommend getting an external USB device for a TV tuner .  
2	  So far so good . We use these cards in the game cameras on the ranch and they continue to hold up great in the 115 degree South Texas heat , and the light freezes in the week of winter that we get . Will continue to order .  
2	  I own this from last one year . I did research from Infinity Beta series , Atlantic Technology , KEF , M & K ; .. many others . They sound great but they are bulky . If you want similar performance and nice look ( Virtually invisible ) yes , Bose is the way to go . I hooked up this to my Yamaha RXV 1500 THX Receiver . It shakes . This is definitely NOT Radio-shack quality .  
1	  Sounded like agreat idea to use with my Olympus D-390 camera . Well I carefully unpacked the device , and installed the software exactly as instructed . Then I plugged in the USB cable into my computer . The instalation started . I got following notice " Has not passed Windows logo testing " do you still want to install it ? What heck I 'll try anything once . No way would it install . Went to Olympus home page and downloaded update . Still would not accept installation . E-mailed Olympus help . Waiting for an answer . I can't evaluate the device 's functioning . It didn't . If and when I do get it to function , I will evaluate the device .  
1	  I ordered this item 12/31/03 . Ihave gotten no shipping info and I have no word wether the order went thru or not . That is unacceptable .

1	  I would give this product negative stars if I could . My advice , buy an Apple , their customer service is unmatched by any other I have experienced . I have 3 Dells , nearly all the same system . My problems started with the last one purchased . From the moment of setting it up , it NEVER worked properly . We called the tech support - and the nightmare began ! Now I have issue with any company who makes a majority of their money in an American market , whose entire sales staff is all American , or at least speaks without accents , and then suddenly when you call tech support with your valid issues you are only speaking to foreigners with such heavy accents and very little regard for American customs and ways of life . Dell out-sources all of their tech support to India and now the Philippines , which are two countries that are far more economically depressed than ours . This becomes an apparent issue when you are trying to solve a serious tech problem and you are met with the attitude of being a spoiled and ungrateful American , and treated as if your valid problem is trivial . I chalk this up to the fact that what you spend on your computer as one purchase takes them a huge amount of time to earn . I could be wrong , but after dealing with the tech support for over two years , I feel as if I am experienced enough to make that call . Another issue that is painfully apparent when dealing with the out-sourced tech support is that the accents are so heavy that it is very hard to understand what they want you to do , and when you repeatedly ask them to repeat themselves , they take offense . I often find myself telling them my phone has an awful connection and to please spell what they are saying . I never want to offend anyone , and usually on the phone with tech support I often feel as if my valid requests of speaking slowly and loudly and spelling do indeed offend them , and thus the quality of service dramatically decreases . I become frustrated , as do they . I don't blame the innocent support staff , they are just doing their job to the best of their ability and are human . I blame Dell for not providing the proper training for these people , if they are to troubleshoot the American market , perhaps not only computer classes are relevant , but to ease the stress of their staff , accent reducing classes would be appropriate . I have heard they may have begun that , but for this product loyal consumer it is a bit too late . Honestly , that is just the tip of the iceberg , more a point of frustration . And if you purchase a Dell and it has any sort of issue , you will end up feeling as if you are on the Titanic and are slowly sinking to the demise of your pocketbook and sanity . To make an extremely long story short , we bought a Dell that never worked properly , and were told that if trouble-shooting did not work that we could return it . While talking to tech support we were treated as if we didn't know how to turn it on , and were talked down to on well over 100 phone calls with tech support . Out drama began on the first day of setup and has not ended , and our warranty expired 3 months ago with the same case number as the first day of setup . Ridiculous . We were lied to , made false promises , told a million different things , insulted , and we spent about $ 1500 for the privilege . We were told that there was nothing wrong with it , that it was us , 4 months and 30 phone calls later it was diagnosed with a bad motherboard . Still didn't work , again we were told firmly that it was not the computer but rather the user , 2 more months and at least 30 more phone calls it was diagnosed as a bad hard drive . Still never worked properly and ever since they replaced the hard drive they will not do anything else , claiming that the motherboard and hard drive are the computer and that there couldn't be anything else wrong - except for the user . I reminded them that they repeatedly told us that if the troubleshooting was not successful we could return the unit - and they had the audacity to tell us we were over our time and that returns need to be within the first 14 days , when we made the original complaint we were well within it ! Talk about pissed off ! We gave them the benefit of the doubt and did as they asked , we were treated as if our heads were firmly planted up our rear ends , we were told that someone would get back to us - and they never did ( we heard this at least 75 times ) . We escalated the case - twice and were met with worse service . Having the same case number since before my warranty expired allows the warranty to continue coverage - but no one will call back , as our issue is so great that they send us to several different departments . As soon as the warranty expired on all other issues , they stopped responding to the same one we have had since the very first day . The last week of October I left no less than 20 messages via email and voice mail with 3 different people and to date have still not received a phone call back , and most were with the people that the case had been escalated to , who are supposed to be professional and extremely qualified . My warranty expired on October 26th while actively dealing with the original issue . I have written letters , I have made phone calls , I have done as much as I have he time to do - and they have never replied . AWFUL ! If you purchase a Dell and it has any kind of issue , you are in for a world of frustration . Like I said , we have 3 , and the last one was a horrible experience , the first two never had a problem . I would never purchase another product by Dell . If I could afford to take out a full page ad in the New York Times for a year , I would do it to warn others of this horrible company . If I had been paid a modest wage for the time I wasted dealing with tech support over this computer , I could have easily afforded to purchase a brand new , fully loaded , all the bells and whistles , wonderful customer service with an Apple computer , and still had money left over for a spa day and shopping spree . Plus I wouldn't have pissed away the original $ 1500 on the doorstop that Dell provided me . RUN ! RUN ! RUN ! Honestly , the worst experience with any company ever .

1	  ProsGood printing and scanning functions . Reasonable price for what it does . ConsDELL INSPIRION 700M USERS BE AWARE - MAJOR SOFTWARE INCOMPATIBILITY ! CANON ALL-IN-ONES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED BY YOUR LAPTOPS !  
1	  This thing provides less light when aimed directly at the keyboard than the laptop screen does with the screen pointed slightly upward . It 's very , very bad . Yes , it 's only a few bucks , but it 's not even worth that . Seriously . I 'll be returning my simply for the principle of the thing . EDIT : It fell apart a few days after I wrote this review and I just threw it away . It 's a real piece of junk .  
1	  I had always though that Nikon brand is one of the top one . How wrong I was .. :( This camera is the worst . I own 2 years old Kodac DC3400 2MP and believe you me this camera takes better quality , crisp photos not like Nikon . I could not focus this camera in more than half of the times . The time of flash to reload is a way to slow ( you 're talking about 3 to 4 sec minimum ) . The photos of the moving people appears so blury that it seems like I had tryed to shoot a " flighing " Formula 1 race car on a track . After more than 6 hours of frustraction , I am bringing this camera back to the store .  
2	  Got this to record church services directly from the audio board . The recorder is very easy to use . Don't bother read the manual , just touch record and stop so it is almost idiot proof to record things . Sound quality is excellent ! We are using the audio input jack and it works great . Agree that the case feels cheap but didn't buy it for the case . Have used the built in microphones a few times and the sound recording is pretty good for recording meetings .  
2	  This was not only an amazing price for this item - I saved at least 50 dollars - but shipping was free and timely ! As always , Amazon is a great place to shop .  
2	  The Meizu Miniplayer is very good all round . I have used it connected to speakers as well as an FM transmitter in the car for playing audio files . The battery life has been good , about 15 hours . The sound is very good with a tendency to have more bass as the volume of the player is turned up . With the FM transmitter I am using , if the volume on the player is too high , some songs will get clipped or compressed at times , making a static sound . I have restricted the volume to 37 out of 40 and that mostly fixes it for me . The controls are sensitive but easy to use , although they are too sensitive to try to use while driving . It is easy to connect and copy files from the computer by simply dragging and dropping . If you connect the player while turned off it will only charge , so it needs to be on before connecting if you wish to move files . The video and picture quality is very good and the video converter software is easy to use to compress and turn the video to fit the screen . The video converter software also works well under Linux using Ubuntu 7.10 and Wine 0.9.46 .  
1	  I couldn't wait to test it out once I got it . I drove a little bit of faster than usual . I thought I got a powerful weapon . I haven't driven more than 5 miles , saw a police car started chasing me . of course I got a ticket and this stupid thing stayed very quietly . I drove to Reno over the Christmas , it alerted me countless time over all type of bands . but I did not see any cop cars around , not even a single time . instead , when I actually saw a cop car , no alert from this poor baby . I have seen at less dozen of cop cars over the entire travel , and this thing did not even alert me once ! I am going to return it .  
2	  I bought and tried several higher-priced , name-brand competitors headphones to hear which ones actually cancelled out background noise . If you buy , try and compare you have a better chance of getting what you expect . The others that I tried had NO DISCERNABLE noise cancellation and / or , did not have sufficient volume for use within an airplane cabin . While this one lacks an auto-off switch , which can save batteries , and has no remote volume control , it works great at noise cancellation . I wouldn't argue that it has audiophile fidelity , but if you want to watch a movie on your computer , this makes it possible .  
1	  I bought THREE of these things over the last two years .. at least two of them from Amazon . ( The actual model number was different - XVC20U in black - but it 's basically the same combo deck they 've been selling for several years now . ) They worked fine at first , but after a while , DVDs started freezing up on them . Oddly , I have absolutely NO trouble playing music CDs in the very same drives . DVD freezing has has happened on all of them , but it is worse on the unit I have used most . It seems to do it less when the machine or the DVD has cooled down . It gets worse ove time . Lens cleaning ( using both a disc-brusher AND taking off the case for direct contact cleaning ) and air-pressured dusting does no good . nyway , thanks to JVC I have several hundred dollars worth of DVD players that don't play DVDs .. and considering the other reviews here suggest there not a chance JVC will make good on them . I have had , in the past , good luck with JVC TVs and car stereo units , and I try to stay loyal to brands , suppliers and what not . But I seriously doubt I will be making any other JVC purchases due to these things . I suppose JVC doesn't place much value on their brand or image or they wouldn't have dumped this stuff into the marketplace . It seems to be getting harder and harder to find companies that bother to make products that are actually worth what you pay for them . I suppose companies that rip-off customers and laugh their way to the bank must be part of the " new economy " I keep hearing about .  
1	  The box is heavy enough but the front panel door is a comlete " joke " Antec should have never let this happen . It is made out of plastic that is not heavy enough to use to make kites out of . Very poor design .  
1	  I returned item as it did not work on my windows 7 . When I plugged it in and installed the software , there was no sound at all  
2	  Best accessory I bought for my Nike + . After banging my head wondering why Nike wouldn't just give us all a break and put two loops on the sensor so you could put it through your laces , I found this on Amazon .. thank goodness ! Just as accurate as my Nike + shoes , and in one case even more so . Don't think that a shoe wallet compares to this . I assure you it does NOT . I used a pretty snug one with my sensor and it was all over the place with pace / distance . Do it right the first time and get this . Thank you Marware for coming through !  
2	  Great Buy . Received item before estimated time . Easy to use . If you are looking for a wire cable for you ipod ipod this is it .  
2	  This speaker system works great with my Sansa e260 . The sound quality is great , even though there are no level adjustments . The only thing I would improve on is having some sort of locking mechanism when the speakers and dock are in the vertical position - you have to be careful when you move it or use two hands .  
2	  Short and sweet , i bought a xact for my first radio , xr8 ( wrong move ) never again . the xact radio and the service was the same SORRY.I highly recommend the st2 . never a minutes problem with this fine unit . Best regrads Jon Tabor in Norfolk Va .  
1	  1 . Tuning Problems : Beware of this product . My $ 25 Grundig pocket radio outperformsit ! I live in Boston which admittedly is full of radio signal overlap . So okay its a little harder to tune a radio station here . This productdoes as bad a job of tuning as any I have ever seen . The signalleakage is all over the dial . It gets about 4 stations clearly in alocation that has hundreds of stations . 2 . Using it for IPod speakers : It is a very clean looking design but as far as using it for ipodplayback remember that it doesn't have any remote controlfeatures or playback info so you are restricted to turning youripod on and letting it play away . You better really believethat life is random ;-)  
1	  At first it chugged along nicely , then it begun to jam when printing in black and white but colour was still ok . After about a year of infrequent use , I can barely get a page out of this piece of junk , because of feed errors at all stages of the print cycle . I thought this machine was too good to be true at this size and price , and I was right .  
1	  I hate this tripod , it is heavy and not stable at all . I think it needs to be tightend . It has very nice controls vertical and hirzontal  
2	  I 've had about 4 different laptops and so 4 different laptop bags in the last 6 years and found that a good laptop bag needs to have this :* Good protection for the laptop * Good utilization of space - everything should be easy to reach , not like a duffel bag where you can stuff everything * Enough space to carry a laptop , mouse , power brick , note pads , documents , PDA , cell phone , umbrella and other basic accessories * Easy to hang on the shoulder and by hand . * Good looksAfter all these points , I was in a big dilemma if I should go for a rolling laptop bag or a ' typical ' laptop bag . Finally decided against a rolling bag as I felt that it would be too bulky , difficult to lift and carry in times where it is necessary ( like when it rains , over stair cases ) + it might be difficult to carry it along with another carry-on luggage in international flights . If you are ok with all of these , there is a nice rolling luggage by Wegner ( Swiss army ) which I had shortlisted - do take a look at that ( PATRIOT from Wenger Triple Gusset Rolling Case w / Removable Tote ) . Having decided to go with a ' typical ' laptop case - I totally ruled out Samsonites and others after looking at them - they just provide you space to stuff things , nothing else . This bag - the Kensing contour is very unique , it has all the points which I was looking for + these :* Front small pocket : The best thing I like is the front pockets where I can keep a power brick and a optical mouse - all these are something which I would need immediate when I put my laptop down + I can keep an umbrella in the same pocket which I can take out if it starts raining . * Front large pocket : not critical accessories / utilities which we require only after setting up the laptop - I usually keep a cable lock , ear phones , spare spectacles , glue stick , white board markets , pen drive , postage stamps etc - all these in easy to reach compartments , without having to stuff them . * Rear pocket - this is the pocket which is on the ' countoured ' side of the bag , hugs you when you put the bag on your shoulders . There is enough space - but I usually stuff very few things - like a mini external hard drive , network cable and a portal wireless router . * Heart of the bag - The laptop compartment is well padded to protect your equipment and it is made to fit 15 " laptop . Next to the laptop comparment are two compartments for documents - where I keep my documents and notepads . Here is the best part - I tried keeping my 17 " scanner into the document compartment and it easily fits into it - even though I do not intend to carry it like that - it would help me in case if I have to . * Easy to reach document compartment - Just love this compartment : When you put your bags on your shoulder and walk towards the airline security , you do not want to rummage through your bag / wallet and look for the travel documents - just keep them in this easy to reach compartment , it does have a zipper . - This is not just for air tickets , but I use it mostly for keeping my company / client ID badges and a short pack of my business cards * Where Kensington loses a star is in the styling - it looks like a really decent bag , very good indeed . But I would have like it if Kensington has styled it even better . Swiss army / wenger bags are the best in styling ) .  
2	  As I write I 'm listening to music on these phones . I certainly knew I wasn't getting the best phones on the market at under $ 5 ( ! ) - but I 'll tell you what , I got a lot more than $ 5 worth . My ears aren't built for the ear-bud type phones , I always use over the ear type . As much as I listen to music on my MP3 player , this is a great little set . There 's nothing I 'm not hearing . I 'm currently listening to " The YES Album " ( still a favorite .. you ' old ' prog lovers know what I mean ! ) Their music has quite a range of sounds .. and I 'm hearing them all nicely .. from grinding bass to delicate acoustic guitar .. not to mention Jon 's incredible voice . If you don't want to spend 25 , 50 , 75 or 100 bucks for phones for your player , then by all means , pick these up . P J Penrose  
1	  I just purchased this item for my upcoming trip to Maui . Amazon claims that it will work for the Canon SD450 . To be honest , yes it can BUT it 's not ideal . The buttons are located to line up with the Canon SD300 , a vastly different camera than the SD450 . You can put the SD450 in the case , turn it on , zoom with it , and take the pictures , but if you want to use ANY of the other features ( like turning the flash on and off - which is important underwater ) you can't use them because they aren't lined up properly for the SD450 . Do NOT buy this case for that camera . Buy the AW-DC50 instead . Don't make my mistake because I 'm going to Maui in less than a week and I have to pay out the nose to make sure the correct case gets here in time .  
1	  We had our TV three months before it broke - it started turning on and off on its own until it just wouldn't turn on again . We gave the TV to the service center ( authorized by Toshiba ) who told us the part they needed was back-ordered at Toshiba . Over two weeks later , we 're still in the queue to have Toshiba simply look for the part , with no guarantees as to if or when they 'll find it . We 've had to make multiple phone calls just to get Toshiba to do anything at all - and we 've had to act as the middle man between the authorized service center and Toshiba . I definitely won't be buying another Toshiba TV after this experience !  
2	  Just purchased this product to send living room ( cable ) TV to my 23 " HDTV on my garage work bench , which is hooked up to an indoor antenna . Well , I 'm surprised how well it transmitted the HD video and audio through 2 walls about 40 feet away to my little garage TV , using its AV input . So , I still have over-the-air reception , and HD reception from my living room cable / DVR unit - completely flexible . I 'm very well pleased . ONE DRAWBACK : The HD video transmitted to my garage TV is only in 480p , resulting in a reduced size picture - does NOT transmit 1080i for some reason .. but the audio is awesome . This may be due to the cable box / DVR output ( video out ) setting but I 'm still investigating . Nonetheless , as long as you line up the units , point to point , video and sound are almost perfect , and no interference with my wireless 5.8 Gig phones or my home wireless ( G / N ) network .  
1	  I am quite disappointed that I was unable to set up this WMB54G bridge . I spent close to 4 hours on my own unsuccessfully trying to set up this bridge with my Linksys WRT54G router using both my desktop and my laptop . I contacted Linksys tech support and worked with a junior level rep for about an hour with no success . My second contact with Linksys Tech Support was the result of a follow-up call initiated by Linksys . I spoke with a Senior Tech who advised me that WMB54G compatibility with XP Service Pack 3 could be problematic . I then relinquished control of my computer to another Linksys tech that specialized in the WMB54G . The tech took over control of my computer for 45 minutes to an hour trying unsuccessfully to setup the bridge . After updating theLinksys WMB54G Wireless-G Music Bridgefirmware he was unable to continue to access the bridge web based setup page . At that point he considered the bridge defective and offered to provide an RMA for a free replacement . Because of other poor reviews and possible compatibility issues with XP SP3 , I have decided to cut my losses ( only $ 25.00 ) and return the bridge for whatever refund I can get . Even though they were not successful I give very high marks to the second level Linksys support for their follow-up and trouble shooting . The senor technician ( Rico ) that worked with me thoroughly knew the music bridge and wireless technology .  
2	  The rating is 1 star less , due to following reasons 1 . It may not support or have any extension capabilities for 6.1 ch & DTS ES . Well nobody would have thought about it then . 2 . I could not configure the remote properly for all the equipment . The reason may be that I have everything SONY except Bose speakers . Of course I can atleast turn of everything with one button . The rating is 4 starts because 1 . Very good Sony Digital Cinema Sound with different music formats 2 . I can use this for both VCR & DVD 3 . It recognizes , DTS , optical cable inputs automatically 4 . It handles Bose home theatre system very well Four of this points do not mean 4 stars . This system is very good . Give a break and let this unit take some rest , by buying RCAs 1-to-2 conversion jacks to connect your DVD / VCR directly to TV .  
2	  I have had this system for eight months . I purchased it after reading reviews on Amazon site . Great buy and product . Easy to set up ( and I 'm no techno geek ) . System is located in a 12X14 room . My test DVD was " Top Gun " . I was blown away and hardly had the sound turned up half way ( 40 on the meter ) . Could not be happier with my purchase . Would highly recommend this product . A good current test DVD for someone buying today would be " Batman-The Dark Knight " . Super sound .  
1	  First it records then the material disappears , spend 6 hrs recording check that is OK , go to finalize it either won't or says DVR is no good , don't waste your time and money . Using Sony DVR - media is a little better but but basically a complicated and bad unit .  
2	  The picture is missleading . The one we got when we ordered this has GOLD ends , as opposed to silver . It 's a highly durable , and attractive cable that has worked SUPERBLY . I 'd recommend this RGB cable to anyone looking for a good cable , for a low cost . :)  
2	  I bought this recorder to use as a audio journal and to jot down ideas for future writing projects . The folder function makes it easy to divide up these ideas and retrieve them . I am pleased with the sound quality as I don't expect it to be recording studio quality . It does the job for me . I do agree with others about the issues with noise from handling , the small switches ( I often have to put my glasses on to see the switches ! ) , and the sudden battery popping out bit . But all in all , I like the light weight , the features , and the amount of recording time . Much cheaper to buy this here than at Best Buy .  
1	  I have to agree with Beneluxboy . The vibration setting is so sensitive that it inhales batteries . After two years , my remote has started to act flakey , coming on when I don't want it to and barely coming on when I do want it to . This is a sign of low-battery usage , but I have replaced the batteries twice in 4 weeks . I have a battery tester and in each case , " full " batteries were sucked to " empty " within two weeks . While rechargable batteries would reduce the cost of replacing the batteries , I shouldn't have to recharge them so frequently . On the plus side , the display was very bright and easy to read . But once I got over the " oo " and " ahh " factor ( animated pictographs , blue color , bright lights ) , I thought it was less user-friendly than the older models . I have since puchased a less glitzy One For All and am much happier with it .  
2	  I bought these speakers and was blown away by the sound they produce . I use these with everything a Ps3 , Computer , Tv and Even a old Turntable . i get compliments all the time from freinds and family on how they sound . these are great speakers , id recommend these to anyone who is looking for a nice set of speakers .  
1	  We purchased this for a trip and it broke on the window we put it on for no reason . Made cheaply would recommend buying . Waste of money all and all . Should have believed the other reviews I read .  
2	  I bought this device for my college bound student . He will be attending college in a major city where he has never lived . This device works in a car or as a portable unit . You can even use it as a pedestrian . Easy functionality . Great screen displays ! I already owned a PDA based GPS device and this device made me envious I didn't have one of these instead .  
2	  This is a great device , soundly beats out anything else in its price range . The single best feature is the hardware encoding , which makes it possible for me to record / encode and play video games at the same time with no dropped frames ( separate hard drives , though . ) I have two relatively minor complaints . First , the software support ( drivers and apps ) is not a polished " appearing " product , like you 'd get from ATI . My previous video capture card was an ATI 9800 AIW , which did not work reliably , even though it cost big bucks . The user interface was much better than the Hauppauge , though , and at least gave the impression someone had put a lot of effort into making things easy to understand . You couldn't actually get it to work every time , but it looked better . Second , the initial setup requires a channel search be complete before it will give you any audio . I don't know why this is , but it had me very frustrated for a long time until I just happened to run the search again and let it complete . ( I 'd interrupted it because it wasn't hooked up to a cable yet and I thought it would save time . ) Operator error I guess , but I verified this on both machines with this card . Knowing this , I have no hesitation in recommending this card , especially if you plan on purchasing a DVR app for it .  
1	  The sound didn't stand out at all , and the components used to assemble it were VERY poor . For using the JVC name , this was real garbage ; a huge let down .  
2	  Once again Linksys has made a quality product . It worked out of the box , after about 4 minutes of setup time . The instructions were dead on and it works perfectly w / my Linksys 4 Port Cable / DSL Router . I also got a Linksys PCMCIA wireless network card to use w / the WAP , and it worked perfectly too . Believe it or not , I don't work for Linksys , but I will now continue to buy their products without hesitation . If you 're a novice or networking guru , you really can't go wrong with this product . The advanced features are plentiful and some helpful , but you don't need to set them for this to work right away . Big thumbs up .  
1	  I liked this mouse and keyboard so much that I recommended it to a new co-worker who sits right next to me . All of a sudden , my mouse / keyboard didn't work when she was using hers .. they interfere with each other . I called Kensington tech support and it turns out they 're on the same frequency with no way to change it . You have to be 30 feet away from each other to avoid interference . How annoying is that ?  
1	  There are several complaints I have about this device , most of which I could have known about if I had read more customers reviews . However most of the reviews were written back in 2005 when this device seemed to have a lot of problems . Here are my main complains : 1 . It does not work with Linux ( unless you mount a share from a windows computer which defeats the purpose of having the device ) 2 . It uses a proprietary file system so if the device dies you can't get you data back without buying another one ( major no no ) 3 . It only accepts DHCP , you can't set a static IP4 . It 's not really a NAS device like so many people try and tell you , its more of a miniature SAN device which requires every PC to have special software to connect to it . 5 . It has a long boot cycle . If you have to restart it then it takes 5-10 minutes to come back up on the network , unacceptable for a device that does nothing but serve up data . Other than these issues , lol , I haven't had any problems with mine . When I first got it and was copying a large amount of data over to it I had problems with it falling off the network or just hanging several times ; now that the major copy process is over it seems to be behaving . However I am in a constant state of worry that the device will die and I will loose my data . If I had it to do over I would never have purchased this device . If you do get it then I wouldn't recommend using it for anything other than mirrored backup . Even the mirroring wasn't fully implemented so SA beware .  
1	  I bought a QPS back in April , I had configuration issues right away . I followed the tech support format and emailed them . Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers . They do not respond through support . Now the hardware failed , I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes . No 1-800 number . Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also . Please don't allow companies like this to thrive , which they all too commonly do in todays market . Buy elsewhere .

1	  I 've been using it for about 6 months , and I love the sound quality and everything about it .. except its duribility . I dropped it about three feet to a carpeted floor , and now it skips horribly . ( hopefully sony will redeem their warranty )  
1	  THE FIRST UNIT DID NOT ALLOW ME TO DELETE VIDEOS FROM THE UNIT . SECOND UNIT DID NOT ALLOW ME TO DOWNLOAD TO THE COMPUTER . CVS RX CHARGES $ 12.95 TO PUT VIDEO ON A CD . PICTURE QUALITY IS OK , BUT PICTURES VERY NARROW AND SOUND IS VERY POOR . WISH I HAD MY $ 100.00 BACK .  
2	  The product does what it 's advertised . It charged my iPod just fine until the prongs got all rusted ( cheap metal ) . Keep in mind how much the product costs and adjust your expectations accordingly . As I said , it worked just fine for me , but I would have expected the prongs to not have rusted , at least not as quickly as they did ( about 2 months with sporadic use ) .  
2	  Ok , just found out that my router , Dlink DIR-615 Hardware Version C1 firmware had problems which could cause Wifi connection problems . The other thing I didn't expect is that the Dlink Wifi / router application software under Tools -> Firmware does NOT poll the internet correctly to check for the latest firmware update , it may or maynot tell you correctly the latest firmware version released as compared to what your router has . To INSURE you have the latest update you have to goto Dlink Home page , choose the correct country , hit the Support Tab , enter in the correct model under " ProducSupport & Download " , Choose the correct Hardware version of the Dlink model , Click on Firmware & then download the latest firmware . Once you download the latest firmware you have to Extract the files ( remember in what directory the extraction was done for the bin file .. firmware file ) , then goto the Dlink router application to Tools , then Firmware , then hit Browse and upload the firmware into the router . When you do this make sure you are on a wired computer NOT a Wifi connected computer . My revision was 3.0 and every time I asked if I had the latest version of firmware through the Dlink Wifi application software which is supplied with the router it stated incorrectly I had the latest firmware . At a lark I went and manually checked the Dlink site and found that I did NOT have the latest firmware . From Rev. 3.0 to Revision 3.13NA there were A LOT of significant bug changes which would effect significantly the reliability of the Wifi connection .  
1	  This antenna didn't do much for us - it worked slightly better than our rabbit ears . It pulled in the signals less than 6 miles away but couldn't do much with those 6 + , which is similar to rabbit ears .  
1	  This item is a joke ! It does not work with ALL Midland weather radios so beware . I hooked up mine and it is a waste of money . Maybe I did not know what I was expecting . I think the cord needs to be longer and the mount needs to have more options besides a one-time sticky pad . It flashes as the alert is going off only ! It would have been better if it remained flashing to remind you an alert has been put out .  
1	  Horrible , horrible product . had it for one year , and then it died . it was hell to finally get all my files out of it onto another working drive . i have a friend that also bought it . has had it for one year . and it died yesterday . stay far , far away from this product .  
2	  Long story short , I removed the old compound and used the Arctic Silver 5 and it works like a charm . I never had a slowdown when I play games on my laptop , and it always tends to heat up . I highly recommend it to people who need to replace their old compound with this .  
1	  I did my homework , and though I knew this trackball was mechanical and rather an old model , I still thought that overall many people had been happy with it . I have used trackballs before to a limited extent , and my husband has the Kensington Optical Trackball with the cool red glow , but I wanted something that would better match my Mac . Well , forget about that . The Orbit got very difficult to manipulate very soon after use .. I had cleaned it several times in the first week , and I am a clean freak where the area around my Mac is concerned . I found that the tiny springs inside were very fragile and one was not really in the right place . After two weeks I sent this back to AMAZON . It is pretty , it SHOULD work better , but after thinking it over I ditched " matching " , went out to Staples and tried the Logitech Marble Mouse . It is a great fit for my hand , and now resides on my desk . The marble mouse is cheaper too , which is odd . If I hadn't wanted a trackball right away I would have bought it at AMAZON . Your options aren't that great pricewise as far as trackballs go , which makes the Marble Mouse a really good deal , unless you are a power user of photo manipulation software or other specific apps which need many buttons programmed .  
2	  This is what you need if you are looking for a cheap USB flash drives . I have had no problems with the device , and I use it all the days . It is reliable , rugged , small and cheap ( very important )  
2	  I had ear buds before this so there really isn't much comparison . The sound is good with decent base , the fit is good . After about 2 days of 8 hour listening my ears began to hurt from being squeezed . They appear to be build rather strong , large wide adjustable headband . The long cord is a bonus . For the price you can't beat it .  
1	  I loved this Cordless headset until I found another that was under fifty bucks which was just as good . ( R * dio S * k )  
2	  Very well made and looks like it will hold up for a very long time ! I 'm not a professional photographer , far from it , but I don't think you can go wrong with this if you have a DSLR without a huge telephoto lens to support . I have an Olympus E-500 system and it 's great with this !  
2	  They been making these the same way since before I was born and they haven't changed a thing . After years of loyal service I finally abused my pair to death and I wouldn't order any other headphones to replace them . They 're lightweight and I often forget I 'm wearing them . They do great bass simulation and I can hear instruments I can't detect on other headphones . There are some downsides too but none of them are dealbreakers . It has a weak size adjusting slider that can snag your hair and the dated 80 's design is kinda ugly . They have no noise cancellation , so sound will start to leak before my ipod reaches half volume , and for something called the Porta Pro , they aren't particularly portable . They fold up , but they don't fit in your pocket . Still , you can't find a better lightweight pair of headphones in this price range . They work great and except for the occasional hair snag , they 're comfy , but best of all they won't break the bank to deliver a quality sound . Take the Pepsi challenge and compare them to other headsets . You 'll see there 's a reason they 've earned a cult following .  
2	  I 've purchased many or most of the brands of Cat6 cable that Amazon sells , and I have settled on the feeling that Tripp Lite is my favorite brand of Cat5 cabling . Performance on most you buy is the same , but these things are made with the higest quality sheathing of any that I 've tried . They perform as well , but are extra durable .  
1	  Fine keyboard , exactly what I expected . I was replacing a similar keyboard where the letters had worn off the keys . Guess what ? Withing six months an even worse problem ( letters wearing off on the keys ) with this keyboard ! NOT recommended !  
2	  Item arrived right on time and still works great . I love it ! Reformatted it for my Mac and has done a wonderful job backing up all my pictures and videos . Awesome product !  
2	  This is a replacement for an identical battery pack that I lost . Works great , long life , no problems .  
2	  If you have thought about getting a TiVo but weren't sure if you needed it , beleive me , you won't regret it . I have just a few shows I like to watch ( The Shield , 24 , The Apprentice , MI-5 , and a few others ) . Now I can watch them whenever I want , and even watch them on my PC . I never miss an episode of anything I care about . Plus I could go on and on about the MP3 playing capabilities , photo viewing from the PC , networking functions , etc . , etc . For " Series 3 " , whenever that comes out , I would only ask for the following improvements : - HD capability - Wireless G WiFi support ( now it 's Wireless B ) - Option for enormous hard drives ( maybe a bank of 2 to 4 large 200 GB drives , to handle the HD data ) - Faster CPU ( there are some annoying delays in Series 2 , especially when rearranging season pass priorities ) - Mac support for video transfers to computer ( we have a mixed Mac / PC household , and currently this is only supported on the PC and Windows Media Player ) - Support of iTunes playlists on the PC ( surprisingly this feature is supported on the Mac but not the PC ) But please don't change the easy , friendly TiVo user interface ! As far as the monthly cost , I found out that my cable company was charging me $ 10 per month for the cable converter box . Since I don't have HBO or other pay services , I simply returned it to them , and now put the $ 10 towards the $ 12.95 that TiVo charges . Almost a wash .  
1	  What a disappointment . They looked so sturdy . They sound pretty good . I bought them off Ebay from some dude in China for $ 40 , shipping included . Perhaps they shipped with a crack on both sides but I don't think so . I could hear something cracking but I couldn't see where the crack was . Well now I know , both speaker arms are cracked right at the swiveling joint . I 'm glad I only paid $ 40 US  
2	  I use Sony tapes in my JVC camcorder . This tape worked great . My camcorder runs like new .  
1	  This item is cheaply made and the arms that snap into your player are difficult to retract . I got it stuck on my Sleek Photo and was afraid I was going to ruin the player trying to get it off . I 'll stick with the expensive but trustworthy OEM one . On the other hand , I 've bought Creative charge cables from this brand and had no problems with them . Also , the previous review is incorrect .. this is a transfer AND charge cable .  
1	  I just called the above listed number at Bose to ask for replacement tips ( they were falling off ALL the time , and I finally lost one for good today . ) The customer service agent I spoke to says that they now charge for the replacement tips . $ 6.99 for a complete set . I am thinking of gluing the new set on .  
2	  These speakers are incredible . I bought these to replace an old 2.1 set of Altec Lansing speakers that came with my Dell 11 yrs ago . I should have replaced them years ago . I can't get over what a difference these make and how much sound I 've been missing , even at low volumes . I am very happy with these speakers and would buy them again in a heartbeat .  
1	  This is the worst piece of equipment I have ever seen . It skipped throughout the DVDs I attempted to play , the remote was virtually useless ( unless you happen to be sitting directly in front of the machine and no more than 2 feet away ) , and it was so light it wouldn't stay where I put it ! Being that there are few controls on the player itself , the remote is a necessity . I ended up returning the thing and getting a better DVD player for only a little more money .  
2	  recently bought the iPAL for a trip and it works great , good sound and reasonably portable . Seems better built and sounds better than most other portable ipod accessories .  
2	  I got this box as a gift , didn't realize the actual size of it ( my own fault for not paying attention to the dementions provided ) . It is a little bigger than I intended , but it will work fine either way . Pelican cases are a no brainer , they are tough , and last forever . If you are looking to buy any Pelican case , go for it , you won't regret it , just make sure it is the size your looking for because it 's hard to tell how large they are from the pictures .  
1	  This works ok but my onw quam is that it will now work woth my i paq 5455 on 802.11b . It seems to have some issues there . It is a known bug . that some b equipnment may not work with it . htere are some people that hacked it to make it b only and the stuff works , but that is not a normal option in the menu .  
2	  Just thought I 'd point out that this is the rapid charger mentioned in the manual for the T7200 series radios as well .  
1	  Bought this MP3 unit about 4 months ago and it really worked fine ~ I use it when I go to the gym . But after a little over 4 months it went south and now trying to get in covered under the warranty ~ good luck with that right . It will charge up but it will not switch on so as to listen to the music ~ not really happy with something that only lasted 4 months even if it was a a great price and no it was never damaged in any way when in use , it just quit working .

2	  AFTER READING MIXED REVIEWS ON THIS CAMERA BAG , I DECIDED TO GO WITH MY AMAZON EXPERIENCE IN CARRYING ONLY THE BEST AND PURCHASED THE BAG . THE BAG IS EXACTLY AS STATED AND MORE . IT MAY BE LISTED AS SMALL , BUT IT HAS MANY HANDY FEATURES YOU DON'T FIND IN MANY LARGE BAGS . FIRST , IT IS A PERFECT FIT FOR THE Z712 AND HAS AN ADJUSTABLE STRAP TO ADD TO THE FIT . THE BAG HAS SLOTS FOR SD CARDS THAT ARE PROTECTED AND EASY TO ACCESS . THE ZIPPER IS EASY TO OPEN AND ACCESS TO THE CAMERA IS GREAT ! THE BOTTOM OF THE BAG IS ZIPPERED AND HAS A COMPARTMENT TO HOLD EXTRA BATTERIES , CHARGER , CAR ADAPTER , IF YOU HAVE ONE , OR OTHER SMALL ITEMS . THE BAG HAS BOTH A BELT LOOP AND CLIP FOR ATTACHMENT WHEN CARRYING , AND ALSO COMES WITH A NECK STRAP . ALL IN ALL THE BAG IS EVERYTHING BUT SMALL FOR DESIGN . ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE SEEN IN MANY YEARS AND A SOLID VALUE ! HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT AND AMAZON FOR A SOUND PRICE AND DELIVERY !  
2	  This device works as advertised , and has a good web interface with which to work . All in all , I 'm very happy with this product . I would have liked a bit more range , but for the money , this device has worked well for me . I found some 5.5db gain antenna 's from radio shack for 30 dollars , which increases the range of this device , so that may be an option for some folks .  
2	  I am an amateur when it comes to telescopes and binoculars and even Astronomy . I 've always wanted to look deeper into the night sky so I decided to go ahead and get something to look at it with . I researched around online and found a page where someone recommended 7x50 binoculars to start out so I went for it . It was also within my budget . And I must say , for under $ 80 they are a fine pair of binoculars indeed . The quality is crystal clear , crisp and sharp . I had my family members and I all out on the back porch star gazing and finding constellations . When you look with the naked eye you can only see a few compared to what you can see with these binoculars . They are amazing ! So happy I went with this purchase ! And Amazon did a great job packaging and getting it here at the right time ( about a week ) . I will be taking these on vacation at the beach and camping later this year ! Only thing I do have a question about , if anyone can answer , is how to make it to where I can take the cups off for eyeglass wearing ? I see a lot of reviews saying you can do that but I don't see where I am able to and the directions aren't very reliable .. Thanks !  
1	  SERVICE WARNINGS again .. Anotyher $ 70 for the factory to reset the warning . This happens every year & this is no longer acceptable to me . I 've read all the reviews & post from Passport , all saying that the heat will damage these .. Duh .. and the post about leaving this powered up when starting the vehicle causes all kinds of voltage fluctuations that can harm it . Look I pay this kind of money I want a product that is trouble free and I dont have to keep paying Passport for service . I have never seen or heard of this about any other Detector . I will say the last time I sent this back for service they replaced the outer cover , which is nice . I 'm just tired of this happening almost every year . Im sure there could be a way for them to allow us to reset this our selves . Its worse than the BMW service warnings but you can code around them .  
2	  The Garmin C340 GPS unit was easy to use right out of the box . We 've had no troubles with satellite acquisition , and we like the fact that the unit will re-calculate a route based on deviations we make from the original route , in fact , we get a kick out of the " tone " of the unit when it advises that its " Re-calculating " . We especially like the fact that in addition to advising us to turn right for example , it tells us what the street name is , so we can concentrate on driving and not on the unit . The unit has been reliable , and we feel that we can venture off to places we probably wouldn't have before because we have this unit to tell us where were going and how to get home . I would buy this unit again if given a choice .  
1	  I have had nothing but problems with my Epson 740 . The printing quality is lousy , it frequently crashes my computer and support stinks . Don't waste your money .  
1	  Forget about the horrible quality of the photos , that 's to be expected of such a cheap camera and of course it 's difficult to use . BUT to lose the pictures that you 've already taken because the batteries ( that you had to buy BTW because it doesn't come withthem ) died , that 's pathetic and makes this camera completely useless and a waste of money .  
1	  I am not happy with this product . It does a marginal job humidifying a room . In fact , you need to have it on the high setting to get any affect . The problem is that the motor is very noisy at that setting .  
2	  I had never heard of wharfedale before but for the price at amazon I went ahead and bought these speakers , as soon as they arrived via ups I hooked them up as front speakers for about 20hrs for baking , after that they were broken in and began sounding real good , so I moved them to the rear for surround effects , after watching the first movie with these speakers I was real happy with the results , I felt like I was in a 50 seats movie theater . Go and Buy these speakers and where else but amazon , great price and free shipping . thanks amazon .  
2	  The same brackets from the Bose store ( 6 for $ 188.00 ) but for way to much less and fast delivery . Thank you !  
2	  This modem is a good buy for the price . It installs flawlessly . You do need to call the cable company and register it - takes about 5 minutes . I was up and running in 10 minutes .  
1	  I agree wiht the other review . The delay is ridculous . When I take a picture of my 18 month old twins and I press the button they are doing something cute . By the time the picture takes at least one baby is not even in the picture anymore .  
1	  These extensions , or liberators if you will , are great but 7 bucks for a 1 footer ? C'mon now , I can get these for like a buck or two each at my local computer / electronics store .  
1	  I enjoyed these while they lasted , but in less than a year the plastic deteriorated and the left ear cup fell off . They literally fell apart . They 're fine for light use , but if you travel a lot then I recommend you spend the money for a sturdier pair with a hard carrying case .  
2	  This is the third time I have ordered this product . I would like to have one in each room of my home . This last one , however , was ordered for use as a Christmas gift . It is an outstanding product that you never even touch until the batteries need replacing , and you never worry about having the EXACT correct time .  
2	  i have this amp hooked up to four pyramid hyper pro subwoofers , 2 12s and 2 10s , and boy does this thing slam , i only had the volume on 12 and the rear view mirror was shaking like crazy ! i would reccomend this product to anyone ! KEEP IT UP PYRAMID !  
2	  This cartridge was only 70 % full but for the price I guess I can't complain . I assumed it was a full one though so just be prepared .  
1	  The video quality is nowhere near what I expected and I am disapointed enough to return it . Its got a good swivel and thats about it ; the content that comes with it is so-so and the headset is pretty minimal .  
1	  I bought this product right when it came out . I took the risk because it had every feature I was looking for and more . The Skyfi3 is easy to use in the home and on the road , and up to snuff as a portable device with the added accessories . The problem is .. well there are many . The device often freezes when trying to boot up . The internal memory that stores your recorded XM content becomes corrupted on a regular basis . Sometimes the device doesn't know how to recognize the car dock and freezes up . Sometimes the screen doesn't even display any information even though sound is being pumped to your speakers . Too bad .  
2	  I didn't think it would work but it does . All my components are now housed in a AV media cabinet in my office and all you see now is the plasma on the wall in the family room . Great product . BTW : my family loves the fact that you no longer need to point at the device to get the remote to work .  
2	  I purchased mine yesterday from a local Bestbuy ( Opening day ) so far I really like this guy . There are a few things that Microsoft should change but the overall device is great . Here are my thoughts . Positives - The screen is very clear .. none like it - I purchased the Brown and love the look . - FM radio is very clear and picks up great - Video is sharp - Menu on device is very easy to use and had great features like adding to quicklist . - The texture of the device is really cool . It looks like it should last a really long time . Negatives - Its rather big for a 30 gig but its still a good size . Its not too big and bulky . - HATE ! The PC software . The software that you us to move your songs over is HORRIBLE . It needs a ton of work . I am a Network Admin and know my computer software .. and this one was complicated to figure out at first look . After playing with it for a hour I started to fugure out how to use it . I understand it now but still do not like the software . If you have a hard time using itunes , then you will have an even harder time using this sotware . This is the only downfall I have really found with this guy . The software automatically starts to sync ALL your music in youe " My Music " folder to your Zune . ( I have 80 gigs of music that I do not want on there ) Another big mistake with the software . - It only comes with a USB connection and head phones .  
2	  I used these headphones to watch movies , listen to music , and play video games , and for the most part they are amazing for the price . My only complaint with them is that after watching a 2 hour movie with them , they felt very uncomfortable and I couldn't wear them for awhile .  
2	  These headphones are a terrific bargain . I looked thru the selection at Best Buy , then I came back to amazon . The sound quality is excellent . The head band is adjustable . The headphones stay on my head , even when I 'm laying in bed . Highly recommend .  
2	  I purchased this same product on Ebay . If you cant afford a real alarm then I would suggest this . I think it is better than not having nothing at all . You cant go wrong under $ 10.00 . If you use a half way decent battery then you shouldnt have to replace the battery for a while . Mine still works after a year  
2	  I am happy with this product , it works fine and is relatively easy to use . It is a bit clunky and awkward looking , but works well .  
1	  Write up suggests that it works with all of the Nikon cameras but it does not work with the D3100 .  
2	  Good quality for a fair price on an item that is not as easy as it used to be to find .  
2	  I bought this unit several months ago on sale for $ 150 . It replaces two similar units including a HP 5505 and a Brother MFC3420c . This is more expensive than the other two , but it is well worth the difference . It is an excellent unit for home or a small office . ZDNET rates it a very respectable 7.7 out of 10 . ( Nothing they rate gets over an 8 ! ) The main shortcomings are that it is not network-ready and it lacks media card slots . It does have a front port for connecting a digital camera . I have not connected the fax machine , but use it for a copier , scanner and printer , which I will discuss below : SCANNINGI have just scanned in four volumes of legal reference materials with about 2000 pages . Using PaperPort 11 and scanning to PDF , and using the automatic sheet feed , I was able to scan nearly four pages per minute . This is similar to the Brother and significantly faster than the HP . Scanning quality in black and white is very good . ZDNET 's testing indicates it scanned color documents at 5.22ppm , and copied at a rate of 3.83ppm . Colors scan a bit on the light side , but not bad . The driver contains corrections which I have not played with . Canon says the sheet feeder on the scanner holds 30 pages . I was able to get it to handle more . The Brother had a tendency to crunch paper on input side . The HP 's input tray holds only about 10 pages and output tray for the scanner was too shallow and it tended to crush paper as it fed out of the scanner . This has neither problem . The Canon comes with Presto PageManager , which is used to scan , store , organize and drop and drag imaged to other programs . I didn't play with it much , and quickly went back to the similar PaperPort 11 , because PaperPort appears to work better with PDF files . COPYING : Black and white is excellent . Color copies are very good . Dark colors come out a bit on the light side , and the copies are a bit grainy , but not bad . When copying , you can reduce or enlarge the copy . PRINTING : Here , the unit shines . One of the nicest features is the duplex printing . I work for attorneys and sometimes have to print two sided forms , so this comes in handy . It also has a front loading paper cassette and a rear loading paper sheet feed which is good for feeding envelopes , photo and other specialty paper . Both hold about 75 sheets . ZDNET says " It printed text documents at a snappy 6.77 pages per minute , scanned black-and-white images at 5.64ppm . " Even when printing " pleading paper , " which has vertical lines from top to bottom , it has the same high printing speed . This is substantially faster than the HP or the Brother . In my opinion , black and white print quality is very good , with straight vertical lines being fairly straight with little wavyness . The letters do not bleed on regular copy paper . It isn't laser printer quality , but it is presentable . Color prints are a bit grainy , but look very good on glossy photo paper . The printer uses five print cartridges including three color and two black . One black is for color prints , the other for text . The text cartridge is larger . COST OF PRINTING : Ink cartridges cost about $ 15 . Canon estimates the cost of ink at about 2 to 3 cents a page . This seems about right . CONCLUSION : This unit is better in every department than the other inexpensive multifunction printers I have owned . As a final thought , it looks really nice . It makes a nice addition to my home office .  
2	  I don't know how I 've done amateur photography and a few paid gigs in the past 4 years , and I never knew that this filter is what you need for a blurred water effect . It 's like every pro wants to hide the basics as secrets . Anyways , this will allow you to set your shutter speed to 1/4 and less in daylight so you can do the blurred water effect . It was either this or spend $ 90 at my local shop for a variable density filter , and this has worked out fine . Why spend more  
1	  About 3 weeks into gaming I heard static on the right side of the headphones , a week later I could hear more static . Now I hear noting on the right side . The microphone is medicore in quality and I dont think I will ever purchase this headphone again but for $ 20 their isnt much too lose unless you buy yourself 3-4 for the year .. Sorry Plantronics I give you 1 Star ..  
2	  Before purchasing a GPS for my car , I compared the many models available and read more reviews than I care to admit . I finally bought a Garmin C340 from Amazon last week , and though I 'm an admitted gadget freak and techie . I was amazed at this GPS.I don't have a single gripe . Nothing . All the positives I read , like not even using a manual , are true . The negative things I read , mostly about it not always finding the best routes , appear in the reviews of every GPS model . While that 's true , so what ? In an unfamiliar city , it 's a lot better to take the long but sure route than to keep stopping to ask directions . I love the display . It 's big and easy to read , and very clearly illustrated . At night , the off-white display turns to black , so your night vision is preserved and no squinting . It comes with a small quick-start guide , and it 's so simple and intuitive that you don't even need it .  
1	  My mother , a computer illiterate , has had this Presto email service for over a year and enjoys it , mostly as a means of receiving photos of her grandchildren , at least one of whom can be halfway around the world for much of the year . It takes little maintenance , all of which my mother is able to handle - adding paper and occasionally changing the ink cartridge . The ink cartridges are not terribly economical , so anyone receiving more than few messages a week may find the cost of upkeep to be prohibitive . The reason I am giving this only a 2 star rating is that this week , Presto raised their annual subscription rate to $ 150 . When my mother paid last paid year , it was $ 100 . That 's a 50 % increase for which Presto blames the economy . Maybe they should have tried for a government bailout instead .. or maybe they should have learned how to make do on less like the rest of us . So , if you want to try this remember you are stuck with this provider and slave to their whims .  
1	  This DVD player worked well for 5 months of intermittent use . Then one night it just locked up and refused to play . Now , when a DVD is put in , the player perpetually is " loading " but it has never again played a DVD . Magnavox 's only response was that we could return it for a " reduced product exchange fee " which is 20 % more than what we paid for it . Bottom line : DON'T BUY A DVD PLAYER WITH ONLY A 90 DAY WARRANTY , AND NO MATTER WHAT , DON'T BUY A DVD PLAYER FROM MAGNAVOX .  
2	  This is the perfect item for an outdoors person . Whether you 're geocaching ( primary purpose for me ) , hiking , or marking treestands , this device is the one . Not complicated and easy to send / receive data from a computer .  
1	  I wanted the exact product as depicted , the in-ear head phone and since my phones tend to break at the plug , I wanted the bent one . Well , that wasn't deliverd . I wanted to send them back but realized that the last other pair of Koss in-ear head phones I bought here also promised the bent plug , and I got a straight one , therefore , no alternatives . I expect this to break within months , just like the other pair did .  
2	  This element it 's great : it provide power to the iPAQ when it has no more batery and , of course , it let you attach devices like LAN and Modems ( I 'm using a 3Com LAN Card in order to see my e-mail account and to synchronize it with my Computer with ActiveSync . However when I tried to attach the Mini disc of Iomega ( PocketZIP ) doesn't work .. and I read about the Dual Expansion Pack .. it seems to be better than the single expansion pack and it provides mor time of power and lower consumption of power .  
2	  mostly everything about this wireless headset for TV is as advertised EXCEPT that when I received it they now say that you need to buy new earpiece covers and change them every few weeks . they should have included silicone earpieces with the unit instead of , or in addition to the cheap foam rubber ones that come with the unit .  
2	  I unhooked my previous D-Link product ( which was so old they didn't support it anymore ) and hooked up this one . After the bried installation process , everything worked perfectly . It seems to be considerably faster but it 's somewhat difficult to quantify . My ROKU works perfectly w / o any hesitation and all my other nodes seem to operate well . I don't believe I see any further range but again , it 's difficult to tell . So far so good ; my son won't be able to try out the live gaming until he comes home from college . I 'd expect this will be the most demanding application .  
1	  I bought this KVM based on the Amazon reviews . This was the fist KVM that I have owned that didn't have a hot key to switch between computers , but I thought that would be OK for a better quility KVM . This KVM was very poor and would loose the video setting ever 2 or 3 times I would switch between computers . It would take me from my high res setting back down to a old VGA mode of display and my display would be a mess and would only clear up after a reboot of the computer . There are far better KVMs for about half of this cost , and that do the job far better then this box does .  
1	  I bought these earphones after reading lots of reviews and because of an excellent price on Amazon . I really liked the sound quality and the substantial wires didn't tangle . After two months the left ear plug stopped working - no sound . I contacted Ultimate Ears as they are still under warranty . They have a pretty simple process for returns which I am in the process of doing . We 'll see how it goes . Hoping that some new ones will last considerably longer . ack theUpdate December 2007 . My second pair just failed . The first pair failed in about 2 months and was replaced ( without any trouble ) by Ultimate Ears . I am about to send back the replacement set - again after less than 3 months of light use . Both times one of the earbuds just stopped producing any sound ! I am 50 + years old and use these lighly and sporadically - they aren't used every day or abused . This time I am asking for a refund so I can purchase something a bit more durable !  
2	  If you need a 6 ' HDMI cable , this is it . As described , and it works as it should . Am I really so bored that I 'm reviewing an HDMI cable ? Yup !  
1	  This worthless piece of flyweight plastic failed to perform at all . It was dead right out of the box . Unfortunately 0 stars is not an option . Don't waste your money .  
2	  After reading these reviews , I was a little anxious about purchasing this product . I found it on sale at Circuit City so I gave it a try and I 'm glad I did . It actually sounds pretty good for being such a small speaker and set-up was a breeze . I 'm going to buy another one .  
1	  After less than a year of use , my monitor starting turning pink . First I thought my monitor was broken and I was ready to buy a new monitor . My wife suggested that I try using a new cable and I did . When using a different cable , the pink ting was gone .. so it must be due to the cable . Be careful when you buy cheap cables .  
2	  I 've used Kodak 's 1850mAh NiMH batteries for about a year in my Olympus C-4000 , and they 're fantastic . I can get hundreds of ( daylight ) shots , or several weeks of intermittent use , before needing to recharge . With its higher capacity , the 2100mAh battery should be even better . These high capacity NiMH batteries work great in frequent use / high drain devices , such as cameras , flashlights , PDA 's , CD players , toys , etc . Unlike NiCads , they don't contain the toxic heavy metal cadmium . They aren't subject to any significant " memory effect , " so they don't need to be discharged fully before recharging . They will outperform both NiCads and throwaway alkaline batteries in high drain devices , and can be recharged more than 500 times . Their only disadvantage is that they self-discharge over time , losing 1-2 % of their capacity per day . Alkaline batteries are still the best bet for low drain devices such as clocks and remote controls . With the appropriate adapters , such as those sold by Star Batteries , you can even use your NiMH AA 's in your C and D cell flashlights ! For best results , charge these in a charger designed for NiMH batteries . For longest battery life use a smart charger that protects against both overcharging and overheating , and signals when charging is complete .  
2	  The only reason i give this a 4 instead of a 5 star is that it could use some updates . ie . metal foot , weather sealing , to bring it up to current standards . This transmitter works great and does all that Canon says it will .  
1	  I bought this as needed a power strip and thought the color coding would make life easier with the TV and components . Several of the plugins died within a month . Threw it away and bought a " normal-basic " , cheaper Home Depot one and have had not problems .  
2	  Great for laptops , fits great in my hand . It matches my Brown HP computer perfectly . works great  
1	  This unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared . Apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .  
2	  This item is perfect If your looking for a tripod thats can stand on almost any surface and not take up pocket room . At a price of less then two dollars this is by far your best bet . I was hoping for a little more though so I can't give it a perfect five . I do alot of solo filming in woods and basements and other such environments and i was hoping that I would be able to wrap the legs around branch 's and other random support structures but the legs were not flexable enough . Great tripod over all but I think I 'm still gonna check out a gorillapod .  
2	  This product works very well for our application . I can say it 's well built and looks good on the wall . Makes it nice when you work in different parts of the room and you can square up the TV for a nice view . Without it there might be a chance of glare from the window . All in all a good solid product , with a great price and rapid delivery .  
2	  I 've tried several 802.11g cards from other big-name brands and had problems with all of them , so my expectations for this card were pretty low going in . All I have to say is I was pleasantly surprised by this card and so far it has proven to be the only card that works the way it 's supposed to . A word of advise - don't waste your time installing the software included with the card ; it 's pretty much useless and does this otherwise perfect piece of hardware disservice by being unusable . It couldn't even detect a single network upon scanning , even though Windows could see at least half a dozen of networks available . I ended up uninstalling the software and letting the Windows ( Vista ) do its job ; it detected the card , installed the drivers ( Windows Update also found a newer driver available ) , and I was up and running in no time . It automatically reconnects after rebooting ( which is something the Netgear card , for example , refused to do for some reason , so I had to manually re-connect it every time PC restarted ) . This card has got to be the best kept secret of 802.11g networking , and I would have gladly paid twice as much for it seeing how well it works .  
2	  We brought this little guy home the day before the 4TH and have only good things to say about it ! True , we also had to consult the owners manual briefly .. but our egos were not bruised in the process . And you do have to shade the display to see it in sunlight , but as another reviewer recently stated .. anything to save the batteries ! We are audiophiles and find the ' mega bass ' button to be superfluous . Just leave it on and enjoy the big sound ! This little portable was purchased so we can enjoy favorite CDs and radio stations on our small sailboat ( when not actually sailing ) . Since the boat has only 12 volt power , switch to the batteries , and it fits the purpose mightily ! PROS : SoundSizeSignal StrengthSteadying Rubber Foot PadsSeparate Power CordCONS : None  
1	  These work OK but 8 miles ? No way . One of the cradles has broken already . We can't seem to get the volume right , either . Would not buy again .  
2	  Item works great and is price efficent . I have bought one for each lens I own . No complaints ! Recommended .  
2	  I bought this for my husband . He hasn't put it down since he opened it and can't wait to get out in the boat . It was exactly what he was looking for .  
1	  The Good : This thing actually does sound pretty respectable . It has a pretty powerful amplifier for a table radio , and for a radio in this price range , the sound is definitely satisfactory . The Bad : The NR31 has a poor quality , non-removable FM wire antenna . External FM or AM antennas cannot be used . FM reception is predictably poor . There is an auxiliary input , but there is no selector for it ; your CD player , MP3 player , or other device will be active whenever it is plugged in . Furthermore , FM radio is audible when the aux input is in use . The Ugly : The FM / AM selector is defective . It stopped working on my unit within days . It is now impossible to listen to AM radio on my NR31 , and other NR31 owners have had the same problem . I would recommend this radio to almost no one , regardless of the price . It might be worth considering if you don't do any AM listening , but many more expensive tabletop radios are ultimately a better value .  
2	  I 've had 2 other FM transmitters ( A Belkin and a Griffin iTrip ) . Neither came close to the quality of this transmitter . Neither charged the iPod ( The Belkin required batteries , which only lasted about 15 hours of use ) , while the iTrip worked OK at first , but then started getting static no matter what station I used . In fact , I had to have the iPod in hand for the static to go away ( and then , it was still not clear ) . The sound isn't as loud as some ( it takes over the volume control , so you cant use the volume on the iPod . ) Still , it 's not nearly as soft as some I 've seen . I found most music came through at a good volume ( I did adjust a few songs in iTunes to pump them up ) . This unit , although it seems cheap and flimsy at first , is able to get a consistant , strong signal , even on stations which usually come in clearly . It powers through them , and the result is a very clean sound . It is a little hard to read at the regular angle , but once you set the 3 presets , you don't need to see the screen . Just set your radio to the same 1-2-3 configuration . Also , turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer . In all , I couldn't be happier .  
1	  These recorders are the worst . I 've owned mine for about 3 years . And yes , they do make good quality DVDs but it is one of the hardest pieces of equipment I 've ever used . And , after 3 years the DVD burner just died . I guess I 'm one of the lucky ones because I 've heard of this problem happening much sooner for some . And , it 's near impossible to find a drive to replace it . Buy this if you want but you 'll come to hate it in the end like I did .  
1	  I will make this review very simple . No matter what features you find attractive about this remote , its shear size makes the thing clunky and unuseable . Unless you have large hands , you will have trouble accessing all the buttons without 2 handing it . ( make sure you go to a retail store and hold it first before you buy it ) In terms of features , the remote has only the simplest of " learning " features . If you want a custom interface for a piece of hardware it doesn't have a code for .. good luck .  
2	  For a mp3 player / recorder / thumb drive this price and for 1GB , this is a good bargain , but there 's always room for improvement : 1 ) ear buds : without cushions , it will always fall from your ears ; 2 ) the headphones cable sports a " heart " . What was that ? 3 ) not much contrast from the LCD . 4 ) only red colour . Despite the aforementioned , I liked the sound , the EQ options are quite good . And - important - it has a USB connector - a plus !  
1	  I am a great fan of Logitech and have been using their mice and webcams for years . Unfortunately , the V320 froze on my desktop twice ( after one replacement ) . The excellent tech rep determined I had done everything right . Finally I asked him to let me have a proven " workhorse " mouse and he sent me a V200 . That model works like dream ! Logitech has one of the best customer services around .  
1	  Took a while to figure this out , including a call to Logitech support where they said they had to escalate the issue and get back to me , but didn't ! Finally after installing Lion on my second mac , I realized that is why the thing went dead . Put it back on an older Snow Leopard system , works fine , back on Lion , lifeless . Disappointed in Logitech for dropping the ball . How hard could it be to make the driver compatible with Lion ?  
2	  VERY FAST AND EFFICIENT PRODUCT . GOOD FOR OFFICES WITH 15-20 SIZE PEOPLE . NETWORK EFFICIENT AND EASY TO INSTALL .  
2	  Hard to beat the features for the price ! I bought one and so far it works fine with my cable modem and 3 computers . I 'm looking forward to testing it with 100Mbit ; a friend of mine uses the identical model on his 100Mbit LAN and he says it works great . Plus it takes up half the desktop space of my old hub . I 'm a bit mystified by the shared " Uplink " / " Port 5 " jacks though - it is 5 port but it has 6 plugs .  
1	  We received a lemon printer . The printer has typically been good , but the printer we received did not work . We have recently contacted the seller to send the printer back to their store for a refund . The seller did respond and approved for us to send it back to his store .  
1	  The camera barely fit inside the case and it does not have a strap for ease of handling . It does have a belt loop handle but it is made to slide onto your belt as opposed to a clip-on which is far more convienant . I would not recommend .  
2	  I have used this headset several times in different locations and I feel it provides clear and crisp sound quality for both the caller and receiver .  
2	  The computer this ram was for only had 512 mb before this gig . The speed has definitely increased since the processor is decent . Good buy with quick delivery .  
2	  I bought 2 sets , for my wife and I to use with a portable DVD player , on a plane . The sound was incredible . While on vacation , I used a pair , with my IPod , in the gym . My wife uses her pair while running . The sound quality is so much better than the IPod " ear-plugs " Was well worth the price , I 'm very satisfied .  
1	  Do you remember how great it felt to break up with that lover where nothing in the relationship worked ? It was like a load was lifted from your shoulders and you could smile again . That 's how I feel about my ex-MP3 player , the iRiver H10 . I was very excited when I first took it home . But after charging it I found that I couldn't navigate the screens for ten seconds without it crashing . Oh , not to worry , there was a firmware update available . Still , it bothered me that iRiver would sell something that useless . What about the people who bought it before the update was available ? Anyway , I updated to the latest firmware release , but it was still WAY TOO BUGGY to be usable . I would select a song , and it would decide to play another one instead . On other occassions it wouldn't play at all until I rebooted . Sometimes the scroll bar worked , but more often than not I would have to work it for a few seconds ( or longer ) to get it to respond . I finally got tired of constantly fighting it and returned it . Ahh .. freedom .  
1	  Off the top the most I can say for this camera is that I 'm glad it was a gift . I had the camera for two weeks before it would shut down with a " battery low " message even though the battery indicator showed full . I had HP replace the camera only to have the same problem with the new camera right off the bat . As for the picture quality , I have no issue there . The pictures are decently clear . The menus are easy to use as long as the camera will stay on . So overall , if this speaks for the quality of HP cameras , then I 'll find something else .  
2	  Like so many others that use it ; I love this stuff ! Used it for a new cooler I bought ( Zalman 9900MAX ) on a phenom II Hex-core over clocked to 4.0ghz with other variables over clocked to a far reaching extent . Cool temperatures idle and full load . I have reviewed the 9900MAX so feel free to look up my review of it as it goes into depth on temp and such with my setup . Pro 's : competitively pricedEffective heat desperationGood for more than one useCon 's : NoneOther thought 's : I used the dot method with the application  
2	  I bought my Sony MDR7506s at a Guitar Center in Cincinnati , Ohio . I was planning on purchasing something for half the price when the dude behind the audio counter took me aside and said , " Look kid : you could save a little money and buy those solidly mediocre headphones . Or , you spend another $ 50 on these things and you 've got a pair of studio quality muffs . You can record with these babies , listen to records .. whatever . They 're gonna sound great , feel great , and last you forever . " Five years later , he 's yet to be proven wrong . Buy these .  
1	  Can not keep CD player in my Nissan Maxima'97 right way . Manual instruct me to make a holes in the original car CD player 's frame using hummer and flattener to keep automarket radio . Not happy .  
1	  I spent several days on making it work on my notebook , but I failed . It worked well on my friends'notebook . I didn't know why it was not fit to mine . I enquried the manufactuer , but they could not provide any help . So I returned it .  
2	  I was looking primarily for the wireless phones with tolerable sound quality that can provide my midnight guitar practice through signal processor with greater freedom . With corded phones , I sometimes ended up breaking the phones ( by standing up not realizing I am on leash ) or the guitar ( tangled by the cord .. ) . I 've been researching for a long time . I tried Pioneer one ( which I ended up keeping ) , XDream whatever , Amphony .. If you are considering wireless cans for the same purpose , listen up . Infrared ones provide relatively good sound quality , but mostly suffer from " latency " or audio lag . With it present a little , you may be able to watch TV or listen to music , you never can play guitar through it . Amphony gave relatively good qualtiy and low-latency , even if it uses digital technology , involving signal sampling / conversions , which most likely results in audio latency . I used 2.4GHz version but couldn't stand the popping noise . The new 5.8GHz one might be better but kind of pricey . Sennheiser RS140 is , in my opinion , a masterpiece in this regard . Cheap ( considering quality ) and absoluately no latency , due to analog transfer . I could even walk in the house , room-to-room , w / o interruption of audio ( just a little " analog " noise , which is more tolerable than digital one ) . The sound quality is actually better than Pioneer 's 5.1-capable phones , IMHO . I highly recommend this product to the ones having the same purpose as mine as well as to anyone looking for good-quality wireless phones .  
1	  I never owned an iPod , so since Zune hit the market I 'd thought I 'd check it out . Went to my local retailer and was able to do some hands on comparing the iPod and Zune . The iPod had a much better feel and was lighter . The sound qualty was the same ( using the same set of head phones for each ) . The scrolling was easier on the iPod . The Zune is larger than the iPod , the iPod felt right in my hand . The video screen on the Zune was a little larger but the clarity seem to pale next to the iPods . Now as far as software installation , I don't know . but when I walked out of the store , an iPod came home with me . The iPod software installed quickly , works smoothly with iTunes . I am so glad I compare first ! I say get an iPod !  
1	  I 've had nothing but problems with this TV . It does not work - I 've had it for service but they can't find the problem . Nightmare ! Waste of $ 315 !  
1	  This clock radio has it all .. almost . The Atomic clock synched right up , the sound is quite good , I like the " Nap " feature and the ability to set two alarms to two different times on each different day of the week is cool . So , I set it all up and put in my bedroom and when it got dark I realized the radio was useless to me - no matter how you set the backlighting brightness display you have to get right on top of the clock to read the display . So trying to set the nap timer or the sleep timer or change the alarm settings , after dark , becomes almost impossible . When you turn up the brightness the numerals just stay the same and the backlighting just gets brighter and glares in your face . The manual leaves a bit to be desired too and just ignores features like backup ( which it seems to have because when you disconnect from power the clock continues to display and the setting are saved ; I just have no idea how long and if that feature is something I can count on ) . Bottom line is I would surely keep the clock if I could only read it at night .. but I can't ; so back it goes . Too bad .  
2	  Let me give you three reasons : 1 . It has plenty of room for future upgrades . If you are planing to install a motherboard with a EIDE interface It can hold 3 hard drives . If u think 3 hard drives will take up room from the rest of your hardware guess again ! 2 . The case supports four " 3 1/2 " inch ballbearing fans to keep all of your hardware nice and cool . Two fans in the Up-per back of the case next to the power supply that will act as the air out-take and two fans in the lower front part of the case act as the air in-take . 3 . I purchased the retail version of this model it comes with 2of the " 3 1/2 " inch case fans and a 350 watt power supply . I purchased and installed the 2 missing case fans to complete the four fans the PC case supports , and I replaced the 350 watt power supply that came with the case with a Antec 430 watt smart power supply to satisfy my power hungry Pentium 4 processor , Xtasy ti 4600 and my Audigy sound blaster platinum , Sound card . Would you belive all four fans and the power supply fans run practically Noise-less ! The only flaw this case has is SIZE ! It stands at " 21 1/2 " inches tall , " 8 " inches and a quarter wide and " 19 " Inches from the lockable door plate that rest 's over the CD Rom bays to the chassis . If you are willing to ignor this one flaw , this Antec Performance case is for you . It comes with 4 CD rom bays and 2 floppy bays and the case 's chassis supports seven expansion card slots and It comes with more features you can look up at the Antec home page .. I 'd recomend you dont buy the OEM version instead buy the retail version that comes not only with what I mentiond in Reason number 3 , It also comes with a generous amount of motherboard screws ! :) The retail version of this case goes by the name : Antec Soho file server . When you look up the retail version here in Amazon or at the antec web site you can choose it with the specific power supply that will meet your computing needs .  
1	  Skull Candy is all about looks , even then it doesn't look good . Sound isn't good . Mini subwoofer is cool but your going to go deaf , and you NEED a battery or else it will sound super flat . The bass controller is freaking annoying to have hanging around all the time . This isnt a headphone that you would want to carry around . Quality of product is super cheap flimsy plastic . Headphone jack broke and i had to re solder with a new jack . ( THAT sucked ! ) Never will buy from SkullCandy . Go with a real brand like SennHeiser .  
2	  I purchased this card when I bought a Cannon SD400 . The Cannon only came with a 16 MB SD card , which is way too small . This SD card is very large and does quick transfers . The SD400 saw it easily and I did not have to format it special or anything . I have also used the card in my Acer Aspire laptop and it was able to find it and copy / edit the files on the card without any problems . I can take almost 400 highest quality pictures with this card , or up to 8 minutes of the best video with sound . All in all , the perfect compainion to the SD400 .  
2	  I like this memory stick its let my store about 1350 picture in my sony T1 camera in 5 MB .  
1	  I 'm very dissapointed on regard this headphones . For the price , brand and aspect I expected a great sound . None of the above , the sound is bright in excess an you won't hear any bass . Is unpleasant . I tried different ways to insert them in my ears and no change , changed the plastic cups and nothig , readed and search in the instructions - which are just a few lines - and nothing , looked at te web and no more info . Conclusion , if there is no info , there is no answer . I wasted my time and my money . You know it , now is your call .  
2	  The tracking link was not working and thought I was duped . Anyways , I received this memory card after 1 week from the date of purchase . But I was sad to see that the actual storage capacity is just 3.6 GB.I hope the card works for atleast an year ( the other user 's review mentions that the card had a sudden death for no reason )  
1	  I am very dissapointed in this mouse . It is very jerky in its movement over the mousepad , and slow in response . I am so frustated with it , I am going to have to purchase another mouse before I throw this one across the room . I should have stuck with Logitech and spent the extra money . I realized later that this is an optical mouse , and I should have gone with a laser mouse which gives much smoother movement . I need a mouse with a fast response for the work I do , and this one has caused nothing but frustration ! I even had trouble getting it to rest over the one star rating so that I could click " Hate it " . Going to try and click " Submit " now .  
2	  I bought this to attach computers to my HD projector , theEpson PowerLite Home Cinema 705 HD 720p 3LCD Home Theater Projector . It works exactly as described . Recommended .  
2	  NiMH rechargeable batteries are a step above the standard NiCads that gave rechargeables their bad rep . NiMHs usually provide more stable and slightly higher voltage ( though still below alkaline levels ) for extended periods of time . They have no " memory " problem , so you don't have to worry about completely discharging them , and depending on the situation , they may perform either better or slightly worse than alkalines . For instance , I always use NiMH batteries in my CD player . They last about 90 % as long as alkalines and , of course , are reusable . A quick one-hour charge will get the same pair going again . Where NiMHs really shine , though , is in momentary high-drain devices such as digital cameras and camera flashes . In a recent report , Consumer Reports had to rescale its battery ratings because NiMHs perform so well . In one digital camera that I use , alkalines will last for one flash-card of pictures ; NiMHs last for over 3 . While the Energizer ( and recently Rayovac ) brands are quite inexpensive , they only last about 85 % as long as the Radio Shack brand . Cost versus run life is the only consideration here , and these batteries are just great for CD or tape players . Note : You will need a NiMH-specific charger to charge these batteries . Overall recommendation : If you use even a moderate number of batteries frequently or listen to music on a portable player , NiMHs are a worthy investment .  
2	  Great because it prints in b / w or color . And has all extra features of copying faxing , reducing copies , etc . and is super quiet . The only one on the market that is quiet which is good for a home or office environment .  
1	  Looked great but only one channel worked / no sound on one side ; disappointing Christmas present for my daughter . Not worth the money .  
2	  I ordered this camera without any lens . I had all the lenses from my Canon EOS IIe which is a full frame 35mm film camera . All of the information I have read stated my lenses were compatible with the new camera . Naturally the first thing I did when I received the camera was to try all my various lens and they worked perfectly . I am very happy with my new digital camera and the flexibility it allows me to shoot in various situations . Anyone want a good buy on a Canon EOS 35mm IIe in excellent condition ?  
2	  this was a cool buy ( got it for only $ 30 ) . It comes with 3 colored caps and a big green light tells whether it connected and is working fine or not ! . It is much faster than previous solid state drives i used and works flawlessly with windows xp .. although if u have Linux ( like i do ! ) then you have to a bit of tweaking and it will work well ! Overall a gr8 buy .. although I can already see 1GB drives on sale !  
1	  I had two of these . One lasted a year . the latest one lasted less than 60 day . Cannot recommend  
2	  It 's one GB of RAM , obviously . I desperately needed an upgrade to my computer , so I got this . I had to do a little fiddling with what slot I put the RAM in , so it took about three times as long as it should have . But now it 's in , and now it 's working .  
1	  DON'T BUY ANY ZUNE / MICROSOFT PRODUCT ! I 'm still looking at a blank Zune screen and a worthless device because Microsoft refuses to admit there is a problem with Zune as of 12/31/08 . Don't trust Microsoft , and don't buy Zune unless you just want to throw your money away ! I 've never been a Mac person , but now it 's time to change !  
2	  This is a Nikon 5874 camera bag sold by Cameta Camera , it is not the one pictured on this link , and it is not the one described here ether , there are no pockets on the outside of the top flap for memory or what have you , only one inside mesh zippered pocket under top flap , and the dividers can only be used few limited ways . it is a well made Nikon bag of good quality , the inside measurements are length 10.5 " height 6 " width 5.5 " if you do not like the Nikon 5874 then this is not for you . big enough to hold a NIkon D3100 body with a standard lens on it and 2 small telephoto lenses , a flash , and a few small accesories , that 's about it thoughI already out grew this case before I got it , but it will be a good excursion bag to take on day tripsif it would of been the bag pictured , and described , I would of given it 5 stars . good quality , solid , well made bag , but it does not have a very configurable inner compartmentI have added Pictures of the bag you will receive , it 's a nice bagUpdate : if you own a Nikon D3100 camera don't put it in this bag the material will get inside the view finder , since it is not sealed to prevent it , and it is not covered under the warranty of the $ 700.00 camera  
2	  I received this as a Christmas present . I use it almost exclusively for bird watching from inside my house , through a large window . It 's tripod mounted , and perfectly balanced . It doesn't tend to drop forward like other large scopes . With the standard adaptors , a small Chickadee at 50 feet completly fills the scope 's field of view . I can see even the tiniest details . I love this scope !  
1	  DI-624M is easy to install and provides good signal ( at least within the range of my flat ! ) . However , despite the fact that it is easy to install , it is a massive challenge to make it work efficiently afterward . It usually works okay for some time after installation and re-installation ( which happens periodically ) , but after a while it tends to do its own thing ( looks like this device has the mind of its own ! ) . It connects to the internet , but prevents many programmes from accessing it altogether ( with an exception of Skype , in my experience ) . Pros : 1 ) easy to install2 ) good signalCons : 1 ) settings change without any prior action and / or your intention2 ) settings change without any prior action and / or your intention3 ) did I mention that settings change by themselves ? If you are considering purchasing a router , it would , probably , make sense to try getting some other product . This may prevent you from pain of trying to work out how to make DI-624M function properly .  
1	  I bought this filter for my Panasonic Lumix LX-3 camera as part of a package deal that also included the Panasonic DMW-LW46 wide-angle conversion lens and associated DMW-LA4 adapter . It seemed like a good deal at the time . I should have read the multiple reviews that criticized the filter 's unacceptable tendency to ruin photos with reflections . More to the point , it 's completely useless to me . It only fits on the adapter tube , and the only time I would be using the adapter tube is when I 'm using the wide-angle conversion lens mentioned above - which is far too big for this filter .  
2	  I needed this router for a WiFi radio project with the intention of hacking it to run a Linux distro to do my bidding . As luck would have it , I needed to press it into service to replace a wired switch during an office renovation . I foung the WL-520gu a capable WiFi router that performed as promised on the box . I 'm going to order another to keep a a spare .  
2	  I 've printed labels and burned around 20 DVDs so far . I 've only had one incident and that was my fault ( I have a fingerprint on one of the labels because the ink wasn't dry ) . I would definitely recommend these . I can make professionally looking DVDs .  
2	  This was exactly what I was promised and exactly what I got ! thanks for ease of service !  
2	  Okay so we 're just talking about a charger for a cell phone but having a second one for the office is really helpful and for the money this is the way to go . Just like the one that comes with the phone and keeps me from fading out during important calls . Glad I bought it .  
1	  For the first few months , this worked like a dream . Then it started misfiring paper and either not printing , printing one line , or printing skewed . Basically , not worth the money .  
1	  In March 2012 I purchased a classic 80gb ipod from this seller . I received the ipod in the beginning of March 2012 , and after using the ipod about 5 times the ipod froze and a big red X appeared on May 15 , 20012 ( only about 2 months of having the ipod ) . I immediately went onto apple 's website and followed the instructions to fix it . Unfortunately the red X still appeared . So I took my ipod to a ipod repair shop and I was told by them and apple that the hard drive was bad and the harddrive for this ipod is $ 99.00 plus labor for installing the hard drive . I am very upset and feel ripped off because I paid $ 119.00 for an ipod from this seller , only had it for 2 months and used it 5 times . I contacted the seller about 13 days ago and seller has not responded . I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN . I have purchased tons of items from amazon 's website and this is the 1st bad review haven't had to write .  
1	  very instabil product much packet loss , hangs often und must becold started , BUG : con not operate with hidden SSID !  
1	  I buy these Verbatim discs on a regular basis from other companies and never have a problem . Out of the first 10 discs on the spool , 9 were defective . I just stop trying to use them . I have not had 1 defective Verbatim disc from any other company . I will not go through the problems of returning them but will never buy them from this source again .  
1	  The sound is great .. the set is very very comfortable , easy to hook up .. the price is right . The problem is after about 10-minutes the sound turns off and gets ' white ' sound which tears off the ears .. pulled off the headset , redic everything even though I had a tcch hook them up . Same thing over and over .. after about 10 minutes , turns off the sound . Wait about 10 minutes and can get the TV sound again .. but it continues over and over . Disappointed in the Quality Control .. the remanufacturing was not successful . Will return them as they are still under warranty . . this happened the first day .  
2	  I already owned one of these radios for a few years . Had to replace it after my cat knocked it down a flight of stairs . If your someone who does not leave the radio or TV on a lot to get current forecasts , then this device will bring you emergency broadcasts of severe weather in your vicinity several minutes before you have to take action .  
2	  I use this mainly to scan film . It is a little slow , but the quality is awesome . Great product , great price .  
1	  It 's very strange that I ordered this product along with the other product a the same time to the same address , but I only got the other item . Hmm ?  
1	  Camera , mic , drivers , and software all worked fine . The clip will not hold properly on the rather wide edge of the Thinkpad T-series laptop . This caused the unit to constantly slip around and fall off . This is somewhat surprising from Logitech considering popularity of T-series laptops . Logitech Support acknowledged repeated emails but did not offer any solution or resolution .  
2	  I have always been with the war against Apple 's plan to take over the mp3 industry . This little gadget should get the rest of the publics attention . Although the Ipod video is thinner the vision is quite worth the extra 30 bucks , besides who really cares about the extra width . Pros : High Definition Screen , custom wallpaper , verticle touch pad and pressure buttons instead of all touch , sound quality is rediculous , removable disk option , radio , video output to tv , compatable with most video formats , Battery life is excellant , compatabilty most applications , durabilty . Cons : lack of silly Ipod like accessoriesso sell your Ipod and get this  
1	  The flash drive that I received is defective . I bought is as a gift for my father and carried it across half of the world before I opened the package . All PC in the house recognized it , but in attempt to read it I receive a warning that the disk is not formatted . When I try to format the disk , I get another warning that says that the disk cannot be formatted . Instructions from Tribeca tech support did not help . Bottom line - it 's a piece of junk .  
2	  If you need the basics and priced very reasonable the Whistler Pro-58 fills the bill nicely . No regreats and all smiles .  
2	  I unpacked and connected to a pair of Bose 201 speakers .. sounds great ! Had to read the manual to figure out how to set presets and manually tune .. not hard . The sound is clean . I would have wanted phono inputs too , but hey theres only a few of us left . Otherwise , this seems to be well made and quite powerful . So far so good ..  
2	  These binoculars are fantastic ! I owned a pair of 8 x 24 and the universe looks like a different place . I used a tripod and I am able to see the moons of Jupiter ! Great quality for the price .  
1	  This receiver unexpectedly turned off during the warranty period . It was more of a distraction than a problem , so I decided not to bother JVC with a repair request . After the warranty expired , however , the receiver would not stay on . So I wrote to JVC , explained that the problem surfaced during the warranty period , and asked if JVC would therefore be kind enough to repair it within the warranty . In response , JVC 's " Customer Care Coodinator " ( Betty Sierra ) told me that JVC would charge me full price for both parts and service to repair the receiver . She also structured the arrangement so that I would have to ship the unit outside of the city in which I live and , to boot , pay the shipping cost . I have written JVC and asked for reconsideration of this decision and will update this posting with its answer .  
1	  I 've owned mine about a year . So far , no durability issues , and the sound is excellent - with one caveat : you need a device that can crank it up a bit , since the native sound isn't all that loud . BUT .. I find it to be very uncomfortable when placed alongside the ear . The hard internal speaker is really easy to fit into the plush sleeve , but using it directly against your ear - rather than under the pillow - is anything but the " teddy-bear " like experience CCrane promises . You feel the hard speaker through the cover , and it isn't nice . Again , under the pillow works , but volume can be weak . With my bedside radio - a Logitech Squeezebook Radio - I can't get enough volume . I realized I already had a better solution : tune in to the radio via an internet radio app on my iphone and stick the phone itself , volume up , under the pillow . Very little ( if any ) chance of damage to the phone , and it works beautifully . Many of the radio apps have sleep functions , or you can play a podcast in iTunes and use the " sleep after current playlist is done " function in the iPhone 's native clock app . :  
2	  I got this case almost 5 years ago , to use with a digital Canon Elph . I love the case . It is still in perfect shape after 5 years of intense use . I bring my little camera everywhere , and always bring it in the case . I throw it in my purse , coat bag , or around my shoulder . It protects the camera very well . The case is at the same time light and sturdy . The zippers have had no problems . It has 2 extra smaller compartments - an exterior one ( on the front " flap " ) , which is zippered and perfect to store 1 or 2 memory cards , and another one under the " flap " ( the flap closes with velcro on top of it ) , where in a pinch you could put an extra battery . The main compartment closes with a zipper . The zipper is long enough to make it really easy to take the camera in and out . I just ordered a Mountansmith Cyber II for another camera , and I wish I would have ordered a second Lowepro instead . Both cases seem well made , but the Lowepro 's design is better hands down .  
2	  You won't find any headphone in this price range with such rich sound quality . I 'm not an audio expert but I can attest that when I used these with my iPod it opened up a whole new world of sounds that I just couldn't hear with other headphones . If you 're looking for a basic headphone at a steal of a price you will have no regrets .  
2	  Although this book has received an amazing amount of publicity , wade through it and read the novel on its own terms . I haven't read The Secret History , so have no comparison to make between the two , but judging from the quality of Tartt 's writing , we are in the presence of a REAL WRITER , someone with the skill to make readers sit up an take notice . The novel centres on the fading glory of the old South , with its dilapidated mansions and issues of class and hierarchy still central to the characters . Tarrt 's writing is a refreshing change to the precious plots that are often sold as modern literature . The writing is imaculate and although it is a " long " novel , it is not long-winded . By the end of the novel I was completely drawn in and my university texts sat unread as I eagerly read to the end . I found it utterly convincing and satisfying without the traces of sentimentality that often cloud books about the South . It was well worth the ten year wait !  
2	  Exactly as advertised . Works perfectly with my Mac Mini ! Great construction and solid fit .  
1	  Wow , I ordered two things from this seller and this was the last thing scheduled to show up . It was the first thing to show up and 3 days early ! Talk about awesome . Not a thing wrong with it either . Works perfect .  
1	  My Windows Laptop has burned every kind of DIsk - and generally works great . Except with Verbatim . To date , I 'm getting it to accept / acknowledge about 1 in every 5 disks I try to burn . Save your money and get something else .  
2	  I give it 5 stars to counter the idiot first reviewer . It 's obvious to any G series owner that this camera drops the flip screen and RAW format . Get over it . Making up for the loss of the flip screen is a higher resolution , bigger fixed screen . It 's much nicer than the screen on the G6 . I didn't like the loss at first , but i realized i never used it that much except as a means of protecting the screen . It 's actually nice to take the camera out , turn it on , and start shooting without having to flip the LCD back into place . The loss of RAW does not affect me . I 'm someone who takes many photos especially of my newborn but I don't do a lot of post processing . RAW files are huge . The pics generally are good enough and digital has always allowed me to take more than necessary and delete any bad ones . The pics taken with the G7 are great quality . I think this is an issue affecting primarily pros who use this as a second camera , but there is great software out there for jpegs . And most people couldn't tell a jpeg pic from a RAW pic . I think Canon erred on this as i don't think this is the issue that will force people to buy its more profitable dslr cameras . DSLR will always be superior for those action shots or low noise high ISO pics . Maybe it will return in the G8 if the series continues . No matter what , Canon is taking a beating in every review for this . Instead of focusing on what this doesn't have that the G6 had , let 's focus on what this one has instead . IS . Image Stableizer . This is very important . It allows you to take the flash off and take hand held shots in low light . No more blurry pics . Digic II . Allows faster processing and overall performance . Face detection is also new and seems to work nicely . Hotshoe . Very few non dslr cameras have this although i 'm sure the average consumer doesn't care . 6x zoom . Screen . And ability to take wide screen pics . The camera feels very solid and seems smaller than the g6 and of course looks better with the black . The controls and menus are laid out easier IMO . 10 MP isn't that big of a deal to me although i 'm sure it has it 's mass appeal . I think 8 might 've been better , but i 'm not complaining . Macros are much easier to take with this camera vs the G6 . Again , IS helps big time . Lens cap . What lens cap ? This one doesn't need one . Prior G cameras had that loose one that always seemed to pop off . Battery life seems shorter though so you may want that extra battery this time . ( never bought an extra for G6 ) . And it takes SD media which i really don't care for but it is more compatible for me since my laptop has one built in . The movie mode is much improved as well although i have a camcorder for that .. it 's still nice to have . Bottom line , 599 is a lot to pay for a camera these days ( i paid more for the G2 at the time and thought it was pretty cool back then ) . But this is a step short of stepping into the expensive and bulky dslr world . You get a lot of tech in this camera . I 've owned a G2 and a G6 ( that died on me ) and this is quickly becoming my favorite by far . It 's much faster due to the processor . And you get all the manual controls you could want plus the option to add external flash . For point & shoot consumers , just put it on auto which makes my wife happy .  
2	  Great features and flexibility , takes great pictures - it 's a wonderful camera for the money .  
2	  I bought this sub with matching soundbar as a replacement to my 6 speaker surround sound unit . The new setup is soo sweet ! The sound bar rocks and this sub packs a huge punch ! My living room is small , but I guarantee this sub could live up to larger expectations . Great price and a highly recommended add-on to the sound bar .  
2	  I 've only burned a few discs since purchasing this drive , but haven't had any problems yet . I 've used Plextor drives in the past , and they 're really reliable , which is why I purchased this one . I 'm really looking forward to the features listed , although I suspect that many of them work in the background and are always unseen .  
1	  I thought it would be worth a chance considering the bad reviews and the more numerous good ones . I bought this for a 7-year-old . She used it once , then one side went dead . It was a waste of money .  
2	  I unpacted the parcell and quickly read the instructions . The software provided worked well on Vista . It provided a complete backup with no problems but the backup was slow . I do not believe that the backup time was any slower than other backup units but there are some untis that are easier to use ( the one click which I do not own ) and some of the other backup units I considered buying . The reason I purchased this unit was price . For the price I feel it was a good investment . Jim  
1	  no itrip , no ipod . toughskin is not good for that reason  
1	  My Micromemo showed up today , and on first glance it 's a really sharp , well-designed product . Then I plugged it into my Nano . It 's two hours later , the Nano is locked up , and won't respond to any key commands . iTunes won't recognize it . Apparently the only solution is to let the iPod battery run down and reformat it with iTunes . This means I 've lost the use of the iPod for several days - assuming this works . Thanks , Micromemo . I 'll be mailing it back tomorrow .  
2	  Lowepro is a good name in camera bags . I say this because being a photo journalist for a number of years , I needed a good bag , and I rely on Lowepro .. The Nova 1 is an attractive , small ( maybe a little too small all black bag . it has a strong shoulder strap , good stitching , and a comfortable feel and look . Maybe I would include more pockets for extra film cases , ' cause I always have lots of film .. but for the everyday user that doesn't , it 's a good investment , and not too expensive either ! Lowepro = a name you can trust , coming from a camera expert .. ( self proclaimed ) =)  
1	  I have no idea if this is a good UV protector or not since when i bought my camera from Amazon it recommended I purchase this as well but it doesn't fit the lens that came with my camera .. teach me to assume Amazon recommends stuff that would be useful .  
1	  This review is well after the fact , but I feel a need to balance out the overwhelming positive reviews . I bought this unit two years ago as a Christmas present . Hooked up fine to a laptop and worked great .. for a few weeks . Then the right speaker totally went out . After running some tests by switching wires and speakers , I determined the problem to be in the subwoofer . The subwoofer input for the right speaker ( the part where you insert the red and black wires ) is defective . I should have returned the unit right then , but my wife was using it and was fine with sound coming from just one speaker . My bad . When it was functioning properly , the sound was terrific . No complaints . But there appears to be quality issues with this system , as evidenced by other users having similar problems . There is also a guy on ebay who specializes in simply fixing the subwoofer for this system .. hmm . Trouble is , you have to ship it to him . Not worth the time and energy , especially at this point . I paid about $ 100 for this system and will just chalk it up to a bad experience . Not worth paying another $ 25-30 or more for parts , shipping , etc . , and then wondering if the problem will really be fixed . I 'll simply purchase another system - but a different brand . I know Klipsch has a great reputation and this system got rather spectacular reviews , which influenced my original decision . But once burned with a defective product , I 'll look elsewhere next time . Buyer beware !  
2	  Hello all , we use this player in our Salon . We have it connected to a RCA to Coax converter , so that we can feed DVD video to 5 different TV 's without needing 5 different players . Our cyberhome player has been playing DVD 's , for 12hrs / day , for 6 months now . The player has been running for that many hours and that many days , and it runs great ! Not a hitch , not a problem ! It 's AWESOME ! Our unit goes through a lot of abuse , and just keeps going . Cant beat it for the $ 29.99 I paid for it ! I did know their was a overheating problem with this perticular modle unit , so I just glued 4 bottlecaps from 2liter soda bottles to the bottem pads of the unit , to raise it about 1 inch off it 's stand . And since then , unit runs very cool to the touch ! JUST A TIP FOR YA ALL THAT WAS ! ENJOY YOUR MOVIES !  
1	  The printer was really great , and convenient when I first bought it . I must have owned it for almost two years . I paid $ 99 for it . I really feel bad for people who bought it when they first came out . I must have put two or three sets of genuine Epson Ink ( effectively paying another $ 99 ) . Then I used some non-oem ink which worked fine for a while . Then out of nowhere the thing prints blank pages . I thought maybe it was the non-epson ink , but it seems that it was just poorly designed . I tried fixing it , but it didn't work , and cracked some plastic piece inside the printer anyway when reassembling it . At least the scanner still works ! : ) Will buy a laser , had enough of ink problems and being ripped off for it .  
1	  I got my camera in October of 2008 . Less than a year later ( prior to June 2009 .. I would say closer to March ) , the battery discontinued to work . My camera refused to turn on , despite the battery having been recently charged , and when I put the battery in the charger , the red light flashed on and off rather than charging . Basically , what happened to me is what seems to have happened to many other people rating this item . However , many people are saying it 's annoying , but an easy fix . Well , perhaps . But I don't know how to " jump start " the battery and , while I 'm sure that 's effective and helps a lot of people , if you don't know how to do it , you 're still stuck with a dead battery . I bought my second battery in June of 2009 ( around mid June ) for 50 dollars . I know , I know , but I was desperate and needed it immediately ; I couldn't wait to have it shipped as I was leaving on a trip . So , here I am less than a year later , with another dead NP-20 battery . I am tired of buying these things only to have them fail less than a year later . It would be one thing if I just ended up with a bad one and the next one I buy will be fine . That happens , what can you do . But it sounds like these batteries are largely of poor quality and need to be replaced or jump started on a regular basis . I 'd rather just get a different camera and not have to worry about whether this is the time I 'll turn my camera on only to find out the battery died and miss another great photo opportunity just because some company is alright with selling people products of low quality . I actually really like the camera . I had the same one , but an earlier model , two years before I got the one I have now . That was an absolutely fantastic camera and I was heartbroken when it broke ( most likely my fault .. now I always keep it in it 's case when I 'm not using it ) . It 's not the camera that I have a problem with , but the disappointing and unpredictable battery . So I think I 'll just get a new camera this time and it will not be a Casio .  
2	  I own one of these for over a month by now . Regarding performance , I have no major complaints . This gadget delivers as promised , and sounds beautifully ; even through my cheapo headphones ( I could NOT bear the tinny sound of the original Creative headphones , so I replaced them with a pair of Sony low-end cans , which happen to improve the sound a lot . ) Now I will try to analyze the Zen Jukebox in some detail : 1 . Performance : As I said , it is really good . I cannot wait to buy a good pair of headphones , then the sound will surely be even better . Even now I perceive some details I 've never had before in some of my oldest songs , it is amazing ! One point I did notice : occasionally , the sound gets scratchy , apparently for no reason . I read some other review indicating this same failure and saying that it can only be solved by removing the battery . What I do is changing the album and / or turning the Zen off ( using the power button ) . It has solved the trouble every time and , as I said , it 's been very occasional up to this moment . I assume it is related to the fact that this is basically a portable hard-drive which may suffer magnetic interference from other devices ( I have a lot of electronics both at home and at work ) . A good pair of headphones is essential so you can really get the most out of your investment . 2 . Battery : I charged it for 04 hours the first time , following the Manual 's instructions . An average of 10 effective hours can be expected from a 03 hours charging . Considering I have to use a higher volume level to compensate my lack of good headphones , I guess this is acceptable . 3 . Software : Many people complain about the accompanying software . It 's certainly not the best they could supply . Nevertheless , it has some advantages : for example , transfer is unbeatable faster than with any alternative ( Windows Media Player and Real Player , for example ) . And I 've found a way to rip a CD and transfer the files directly to the Zen without saving to my PC hard drive ( it saves time and space ) ! As I mentioned , you can also rip and transfer from Windows media Player and Real Player . 4 . Connectivity : As the manual acknowledges , this is not intended to be an additional hard drive . But it would have been a blowout if it were . This means you cannot plug it in to any PC and expect it to receive or send files on the go . The Nomad Explorer installation is required first . Transfer speed is generally good , but amazing if you use the Creative Software : for my usual songs , it averaged a second or less per song ! 5 . Navigation : You can easily access any song , album , artist or genres , assuming you have taken care of ID tagging your MP3s . The bad point here is that you can only create real playlists in your PC and using the Creative SW . It is virtually impossible to do it in the device itself . But I 've read some one say that you cannot play album tracks in the original order . This is not true ; you only have to select the album . * Pros : Very good price / value ratio ; excellent sound ; doubles as data storage * Cons : Cannot create playlists on the device ; not for athletes  
2	  B + W makes good quality lens filters . I own a Hoya and Tiffen but I 'd hve to say construction-wise , this is the best one . Very sturdy . When buying a UV filter , it has to be multi-coated . There 's no point purchasing one that less than 2 coats . The only con for this is its not as easy to attach compared to other brands .  
2	  The one that came with my tripod head ended up permanently attached to my long lens , since said lens is really too heavy to use without a tripod or monopod . I bought a couple of extra plates to use with other cameras / lenses . I agree with the person who said this plate can be hard to line up correctly . I 'm a mechanical engineer , and usually pretty good with spatial relationships , but sometimes it takes me awhile to get the thing on . If you look really closely , there 's an arrow on the plate to help you , but I suspect a lot of people don't notice it . It 's difficult to see in low light - which is , of course , exactly when you want to use a tripod . I finally took some nail polish and painted a little dot on the edge of the plate and on the edge of tripod head while they were connected correctly . Now it 's much easier to orient the plate and fit it in right . I just line up the dots .  
1	  I can't say anything bad about the picture quality but autoprogramming the channels was a nightmare . Apparently I must have gotten a bad model because I haven't read anything about anyone else having a problem with the autoprogramming . When I started the autoprogramming to scan for all the channels it ran just fine at first . It loaded the channel numbers and then it started going through and loading the digital channels . The progress bar got to 84 % and then froze . Ten hours later it was still frozen . I couldn't exit out of the autoprogramming mode so I simply had to turn the tv off . When I turned the tv back on I could pick up 10 stations , all analog . I ran the autoprogramming again and it got stuck at 84 % completion again . This time I turned it off immediately and when I turned it back on I could pick about 40 stations . That still wasn't enough and besides , the digital stations were still missing . I ran it a third time and was only able to pick up 20 stations . It didn't matter how long I left the tv on when it got stuck at the 84 % mark . The number of stations the tv could pick up was totally random . I thought maybe it was my cable service but that tested out okay . Finally I thought I wonder what would happen if I turned the tv off before it got to the 84 % completion mark ? I started the autoprogramming , once again , and as soon as it got to 83 % I turned off the tv . I turned the tv back on and lo and behold all the stations were there , even the digital ones . I 'm thinking there 's a software error in the chip that runs the autoprogramming . When the autoprogramming reaches the 84 % mark it apparently gets stuck in an endless loop and is unable to complete the autoprogramming automatically .  
2	  We needed to buy another HDMI cable because we got another HD TV ( from Amazon , of course ! ) and we refuse to pay the ridiculous Monster prices . Switching from whatever rudimentary set-up my husband had temporarily hooked up to the HDMI made an enormous difference in the quality of the picture , and if Monster brand would be any better , we wouldn't even know .  
1	  Product failed after 4 months of very light use . Canon was initially responsive and sent a replacement print head , but that failed to resolve the problem . Canon refused to replace or give a refund . Was convinced by top Consumer Reports ratings that Canon was top notch manufacturer . Don't be fooled . Buy an HP .  
2	  I installed two PA101 on a Gateway 9300 and an IBM TP385 . Both were up and running quickly using the drivers from the installation CD . Both computers are running Windows 98 SE with the IBM using a Belkin USB 4 port hub and the Gateway on the port replicator hub . With both computers in use , there is just a little degradation in internet access speeds ( on a fixed wireless broadband , 1.5M connection ) and no noticable speed degradation on LAN speeds .  
2	  The best pot of coffee I have ever made . My son recommended this pot to me and I would definitely pass the recommendation forward .  
1	  Good pack for a student but not a professional sales rep that travels a great deal . Not enough business card pockets or zipped pockets so lose items don't wander around the bottom . Also not enough pockets for cords , batteries , cables , etc .  
1	  I 've been trying to burn copies of my wedding onto DVD and haven't had much luck with this brand . Out of 25 discs , only about 7-8 burned successfully on my imac . The other ones gave me a failed burn message with either a medium write error or a disc failed to verify error . The TDK brand seems to work better for me but I guess it depends on your machine . It 's a shame because it 's a lot of money being wasted on experimenting with brands .  
2	  I bought this cable to connect another peripheral to my TV . After mounting TV , I realized that the original cable I purchased ( much more expensive ) wasn't long enough , so I switched it with this one . There was no noticeable change in the video quality . Why pay more to get the same result ?  
2	  I know this bag has gotten some bad reviews . If you need a bag to carry your Wacom tablet solo , with a handle and all , then this is not the bag you need . I wanted a thin sleeve to protect my tablet so I could put it safely in my laptop bag , or store it outside . Its not going to hold the mouse , but for me , I knew that was going into my laptop bag . It didn't give the last star because there is a pocket on the inside of the bag that i think is a bit on the low quality side , but the rest is pretty solid . My recommendation would be to evaluate what you need in a bag . If you just need a lightweight protection for your tablet , then this works . If not , then look elsewhere ! Simple ! :)  
2	  The Antec Sonata Mid Tower Case is solid , quiet , and heavy like a block of Black Ice ! The first one was so good , I bought a second for another PC rebuild . The large 120mm case and very quite PS fan finally brought peace and quiet to the room . Easy removal of front bay drives with screw on rails with clips - same for the large number of side facing internal drive bays . ATX boards fix perfectly . Solid construction . Amazon 's free super savings makes this a great deal .  
1	  First one came from a seller on Ebay - new in box . Self Cal issues wouldnt allow it to reset - had to return it for my money . Second one ordered direct from Escort . Paid full price so I could avoid all the third party warranty stuff . Powered it up , got 3 self Cal 's , followed by Service Required . Sent it in . Argued for a new replacement as they wanted to repair . Got a new one . Lasted 6 months , Started detecting full bar everywhere and would not reset . Sent it in again - this time they did a repair , supposedly the antenna broke . ( How I dont know , as there wasnt a scratch on it , nor was it ever dropped ) Now .. it doesnt detect as much as it did before . Oh .. and your warranty is only 1 year - regardless how many times they repair it . My Uniden from 1996 does a better job detecting than this , and it cost hundreds less . Either look at the Valentine , or try a lower cost Uniden first - You 'll be glad you did .  
1	  It may have been my mistake , but when the ads say that this works with virtually all printers and it is becoming increasingly common that home printers come with a USB connection , why not make it clear that this will not work with those printers ? I recently purchased two printers , an HP 6110 and a Samsung ML-1710 , and both use USB connections and thus neither work with this device .  
2	  Works well at keeping dirt and dust out while not effecting image quality . Clean glass , easy to wipe off without big streaks , and the threads were nice and tight . Perfect for my stock lens Canon T3i .  
1	  Smart Strip SCG4 failed after a short while . When it switched on it would just buzz . Also , before it failed it was nearly impossible to set the adjustment so that it would switch on and off when I turned on / off the laptop connected to the control outlet . With the short life of the product , I 'm sure I never saved the cost of the outlet strip in electricity savings .  
2	  Even as a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer , routers can be a real trick to set up . God only knows how an average home user would make out . The Netgear RT314 was a very pleasant surprise , though . I expected to spend at least an hour figuring it out and configuring it , but even with my PacBell DSL connection using DHCP , setup was a breeze . I highly recommend this product .  
1	  I could not get this item to download my pictures from Windows 7 . I returned all 3 . Good idea , but it didn't work for me .  
1	  I purchased the drive and immediately saw some funny things happening on my USB and 1394 busses , which were working just fine before that . Then the Seagate drive started disappearing from the computer altogether . Sometimes it was missing folders , sometimes it was Windows " delayed write " errors and sometimes it just wasn't there in My Computer . After a poor customer tech support call ( they told me just to reformat the drive ) I finally figured that the problem seems to be heat related . When I use the drive for extended periods it heats up and starts failing . If I turn it off for some time it seems to be fine again . Ug . Hope that sending it in will achieve a better result ! I have always trusted Seagate with our high end drives , especially in my servers . Now , I really have second thoughts !  
2	  The film was shipped with a disclaimer stating that the quality of the product may be compromised due to its age , but in fact , it 's performance was highly satisfactory .  
2	  This worked great for me , I haven't tried the dvd playback yet but it reads cd 's nicely . I didn't have to install anything . I would have liked it to write dvd 's , but I already have an internal dvd-r so this was fine for what it is . I once had an issue with a targus product and they sent me a new part for free with the shipping . It ended up being a good experience so I went with the name as well as the product on this one .  
1	  This antenna worked perfectly for me for exactly 30 days . At that point , I kept getting " Antenna Not Detected " messages on every receiver I tried . When I examined the plug that connects to the receiver , I noticed that a tiny cylinder of metal inside the plug had fallen out . It 's gone , now , and without that piece to make contact , the antenna is useless . Be VERY careful when connecting or disconnecting this antenna from a receiver , as this piece is VERY easy to break , and you will be left with a useless piece of equipment . While it WAS functioning , however , it performed its job quite nicely .  
1	  This is the original equipment battery for a T60 . Same power ( 5200 mAh ) , same fit , same finish , same everything as the original battery . Works great . Computer doesn't complain about aftermarket battery . UPDATE - After only six months , this battery is starting to die . The T60 's built-in battery diagnostics now says the battery is " poor " and ready to die . I 've treated the battery well , following all instructions and computer settings for optimal battery life to no avail . The battery seems like an OEM battery , but works like aftermarket junk .  
1	  Died after one day . From then on , any DVD would spin up then give an error msg of " NO DVD " . This has been happening so much with players across the board , that it must be a cheap DVD unit source that the big names are purchasing from a developing country . Didn't enjoy the user-interface either . I use the fwd / rev slow motion type features to watch windsurfing videos . I found the user interface for these features on my old VCR to be much better than on this DVD player .  
2	  Recently purchased the headphones so I could listen to sport events and movies at a volume that does not disturb my wife . The sound is very good with a range of 25 to 30 feet . They use Infra Red Wireless which does not interfere with your wireless home network or wireless telephone as some other methode use . I had to send for a replacement because of an intermittent " squeek " and was very impressed with the return system . When I requested an exchange , they sent another unit out without waiting for me to return the defective one . In addition they did not bill my credit card ! They trusted me to return the defective product and gave me over 30 days to do so . Never have I encountered such a consumer policy of trust . Amazon rocks and roars !  
2	  This is really identical to the Apple one ; one may even get confused . It fits perfectly . It is a bit of a snug fit , however , it is very sturdy . It 's a great buy . NOTICE ! Do not expect an adapter to an outlet . This is ONLY the USB cable .  
2	  was up fellas . i have the older version , 2300hcx , its chrome and gold . take the flames of and its the same amp .. i have had this amp since 2001 still running .. had it to 2 t1 fosgate 12s and was running at 1 0hm , before it was kicker cvr 12 's and earthquakes 15 's it did not matter this will run any sub .. capacitors are bandaids you need high amp alternator .. my lights still dim with cap .. so i took one t1 out and running one at 2ohms in a 2.00cuft ported box . still hits .. i have always ran the amp at a 1ohm load .. 2nd time running at 2ohms . had to bridge the kicker cvr 12 's to 2ohm or i would blow them .. grab this if you can . i paid $ 1200 for mine . you set it up right you 'll need ear plugs like i do ..  
2	  I definitely recommend this stand . It is a good value , compact , versatile and works well with the Kindle Fire . I did not want one of the easel style stands , the ones that are a case that transform into a stand , as they are often expensive and I prefer working with my fire sans case . This is definitely a worthwhile investment .  
1	  Oh how this thing sucks let me count the ways . # 1 On alot of my DVD 's the audio would get out of sync from the video . This would happen with store bought DVD 's very very annoying . # 2 . Half the time it would take a minute or more to read a DVD . # 3 . Most of the time a DVD would freeze during play . # 4 and the worst part about this thing is after a few months of light use it wont load a DVD anymore , when I looked up the problem online its most likely that the laser assembly is broken , so prety much money down the drain . Avoid buying this thing . I have learned the hard way that its cheap price tag comes from cheap parts that break in a few months .  
2	  Well i just realized that every cassete mp3 player are all the same . Sony , maxwell , phillips . ON SOME CARS , it might have a clicking noise . and some cars do not . it all depends on weather what it is . I tested it out on some vehicles only 1 has clicking noise ( 2000 Toyota camry ) everything else nope . Buts alright  
2	  Bought this for my son to replace his aging 3rd gen ipod , and he loves it . He originally wanted the 5th gen to be compatible with his car stereo but he quickly found a firmware update that made this one compatible . I bought him theGriffin Reflective Case for iPod classic 6G ( Silver ) which he really loves . All his friends thought it was so cool . It is a cool case as it looks like a mirror until the ipod turns on , and then you can see the screen .  
1	  There was no problem in its installation , and I was enjoying the net surfing for 4 months . Suddenly it drops the connection to DSL modem ( SBC pac-bell is a provider ) , and I have to give it a cool down . It works next two days , but it drops again .. , Their support line is always busy . I will buy another router from Netgear .  
2	  I recently ( yesterday ) rebuilt my computer . My old MOBO was an ASUS P4P800-E Deluxe with a 3.6 Pentium 4 . I put this MOBO in with an AMD 4000 + . I have yet to try and stress out my dual PCIe eVGA NVidia 6800GT 's in the SLI configuration yet , but the board and processer seem to work together extremely well . This MOBO has connectors for everything . For example , there are twice as many USB connecters on the MOBO than on my old one . Very handy for me as I have lots of USB devices . I will warn you to buy an up-to-date ATX power supply like my 500w Rosewill RE502 . This MOBO really needs a LOT of power . Not as much for the motherboard itself , but when you run 2 high-end SLI enabled video cards and 3 SATA hard drives in a RAID 5 configuration , you 'll need not only abundant power , but the octopus of connecters that the devices need . Sure you can buy adapters , but upgrading a 20 pin to 24 pin MOBO connecter and a handful of other adapters can almost equal the price of the new power supply . What 's that you say .. you aren't going to be running multiple GPU 's and hard drives ? Why are you buying this MOBO then ?  
2	  I bought this filter to protect the lens of my camera . It is made a quality material and does the job .  
1	  I recently bought this thinking I could use it to upgrade my TI-86 calculator . To my surprise I heard it was incompatible with XP . I supposed the worst that could happen is that it wouldn't work . As soon as I recieved the Cable it said to go to the website .. so I went and updated the software specific to my calculator . After the installation it asked me to restart . After the restart I immediatly recieved a Blue Screen of death and luckily windows XP found out it corrupted a file in the registry and fixed it but were it not for that I would have to do a format . I have not fully installed it yet as now I have started backing up everything as a just in case scenerio however i warn users that when buying this product be cautious as this is not 100 % XP compatible and may mess up your system .  
2	  The keyboard is definitely used , the arrow and shift keys stick a little at times , but it 's still in really good condition . I 'm especially happy with the price . And now I have my Mac shortcuts back . This is much better than using a Mac with a PC keyboard .  
1	  The speaker came with a defective amplifier so the left speaker didn't work . We had to contact Klipsch Support . They were not surprised and immediately told us they would send us a new amplifier in 2 weeks . It has been two weeks , and we are still waiting for the replacement . I am wondering if Klipsch does any QA testing on the product .  
1	  This cable is low quality , but you can't really expect more for something you paid $ 1.99 . The cable works , but vertical lines appear on the screen which is quite annoying . The image is not dramatically distorted , so the cable can be used for low-quality videos ( e.g. youtube ) but if you want to enjoy a good movie then I suggest you get a higher quality cable  
1	  Waste of money . Put what you would spend on this coverage and put it into a savings account for 2 years and only spend it if whatever you are covering breaks outside of the 1-year manufacturer 's warranty . Chances are you 'll never spend that money because most major electronics will last longer than the coverage period .  
1	  I purchased this from the local cable company because , as they so subtly implied , they would not be responsible for a product I did not purchase from them . What a racket ! This piece of junk started giving me problems in the first year . Of course , the cable company blamed it on Netgear and Netgear blamed it on the cable company . It finally completely died as soon as the warranty was up . Again , Netgear refused to take any responsibility and the cable company wants to sell me another Netgear product ! Netgear customer support was a joke . Not only could I barely understand the person I was speaking with in India but I was told there was nothing he could do about the problem and to contact my cable company . DO NOT BUY NETGEAR PRODUCTS !  
1	  I was so looking forward to having a new coffee maker that would not be letting the grounds touch plastic .. but the water might be reaching too hot of temperature , I don't know , because after 5 days of trying and after buying the most expensive and delicious percolator grind coffee I could find , it still doesn't taste right .. so I 'm returning it .. Also , it is a little more cumbersome to clean it , refill it with grinds and water , etc .. the whole routine takes more time than your normal coffeemaker ..  
2	  what can i say it does the jobwhat can i say it does the jobwhat can i say it does the job  
2	  Executive Summary : If you pay more than $ 5 for a 2m ( 6 ft ) cable ( less shipping ) , you are getting ripped off . [ .. ] That review was what made me come to Amazon and buy the under-a-buck cables . My hardware is so close , even a 6 foot cable is about double what I need . I personally tried the Monster cable , vs the Radio Shack cable , vs this cable and I couldn't tell a lick of difference . I 've been using these cables ( and an HDMI-DVI adapter for use on my MacBook Pro ) with my Mac , PS3 ( games and Blu-Ray ) and cable box and have had ZERO trouble . The gizmodo review of cables shows that in the 6 foot range you 'll probably never know the difference . That works for me . Unless you are going to start running your gear 30 + feet , this will probably work great for you . And , if it doesn't , you are out , what ? A couple of bucks ? I 've paid more for lunches that were nasty .  
2	  Needed this extra long cable to give me the flexibility I needed in attaching a peripheral to my PC . Works perfectly .  
1	  Disabling ssid broadcast doesn't work - the ssid is still seen by my laptop . wpa doesn't work w / the dlink DWL-G630 card though I suspect it 's the card 's fault . Returned for another brand 's router and card . Disabling ssid broadcast works , ie , the ssid is hidden . And wpa works very for a few hours straight so far .  
1	  This external USB burner never worked properly for me . Sometimes it would never be recognized as a drive , and it would take multiple uninstalls / reinstalls just to get it recognized . Then trying to burn a CD ? ! Forget about it , the software was not very good and it would stop half way through and ruin the CD . Not a good product and the tech support for this product is almost non-existent . They would continually blame my USB controller , which by the way has no issues with other USB devices , including other brand USB burners .  
2	  This is a great drive . It is fast , silent , and seems to be reliable . It works well with my PC and Laptop . However , there are two minor quirks . 1 ) I use an IBM Thinkpad X31 laptop . When I boot up with the Seagate drive plugged into my USB port , my IBM system won't boot up unless the Seagate drive is disconnected . I changed my BIOS boot priorities to ignore the Seagate drive , but that didn't work . 2 ) The drive comes with two " pigtails " on the USB cable . One " pigtail " is labelled data + power , the other pigtail is labelled power only . It seems like this drive may consume more power than other drives and Seagate was forced to add an additional pigtail to draw power from a second USB port . Apparently , my PC 's USB port provides enough power so the 2nd " pigtail " isn't used . If you want a good , reliable drive , you can't go wrong with a Seagate drive .  
1	  We bought this unit for the rare long car trip that we take with our 1 and 3-year-old little girls . We used the unit during 5 or 6 trips since we bought it 9 mos ago and it has now stopped working . It will play for maybe 10-15 minutes and then will freeze up and become unresponsive despite trying multiple different DVDs . I think it may be overheating . A call to customer service was a waste of time . We were told the one year " parts " warranty only applied to " external " parts . If you must buy this unit consider an extended warranty or buying with a credit card that will warrant the item . Better yet , stay away .  
1	  This camera has a great concept of a weather proof , compact go anywhere body BUT .. Beware that if you buy this , the software that comes with it to download your photos onto your computer will only let you edit and print those photos . In other words , you CANNOT e-mail or even save them to disk without purchasing the upgrade to the software from Olympus . Also , the camera takes okay photos , but I noticed that 1 out of every 5 or 6 photos is blurred for no apparent reason . I am not a professional photographer , but this is my third Olympus digital camera and it is the most expensive and poorest performer overall . That 's not to say that it 's a bad camera , but I would have expected better for the price . Having said that , it does have some useful settings , and I love the compactness and portability of this camera . I 'm just very annoyed that they 're expecting everyone to pay for the upgrade to the software to make the photos taken with this camera share-able digitally .  
2	  I use it to control my media center pc , it works awesome . I would give it 4 1/2 stars , but Amazon doesn't do halves . The instructions weren't to clear on how to charge the keyboard , make sure the switch is off , otherwise nothing happens .  
1	  This hard case is cheap , cheesy plastic with velco to fasten your PDA to the interior . It is inconceivable that this is a PalmOne product but the sad fact is that it is indeed . Avoid , avoid , avoid . I returned mine to the store from whence it came and the return was accepted despite the opened bubble pack .  
2	  Just from using my friends iPod during school , and watching videos on this you can clearly see that it is a great great iPod . Yes , there can definetly be improvemnents but for now this is the iPod to get !  
1	  I did not buy through Amazon . But this recorder is terrible . Freezes many times during DVD recording . RCA passes you on to another company for assistance . Recording from VHS to DVD is poor quality . Pass this one by !  
2	  From what I recall of earlier reviews , there was concern that sound could not be heard without outside speakers linked to the computer . I have a Sony 42 inch LCD digital TV which provides four HDMI input locations . One of those locations also provides a place to connect a cable for stereo sound inputs . To do that , all I had to do was to buy a cable with a mini-jack at one end to insert in the computer 's earphone jack , and with two RCA jacks at the other end to plug into the TV . This cable is available from Radio Shack at about $ 5 . I have copied old video that I made during the mid-1980 's onto DVDs , and wanted to see and hear it on the big screen . I connected my computer to the TV using the HDMI to DVI cable and the sound cable , inserted a DVD into the computer , and was very pleased with the result . It looked and sounded as if the video had been taken yesterday . Not sure if this is true , but it seemed that the picture on the Sony TV was actually better than the original video tape . I am expecting that this will work with movie DVDs as well .  
1	  I specifically searched for FOCUS brand cartridges when I was directed to this seller . I always use FOCUS brand and have not had many problems . I received my order today and was extremely disappointed that the cartridges I ordered were in fact not FOCUS brand . I have had bad luck with other re-manufactured cartridges and feel that advertising the FOCUS brand logo provides the customer with a false sense of the product . I will make sure not to order from this seller again in the future !  
2	  Sandisk rules the compact flash world .. and rightfully so . Durable , fast write speeds , great price .  
2	  This bag was on sale when I bought it with my D40 . People are very incorrect in saying what does and does not fit . It DEFINITELY fits a D40 with a 55-200 lens . Also , I have since upgraded first to the Nikon 18-200 lens , and more recently to a D80 . It absolutely fits my D80 with 18-200 , much less any lesser combination of my gear . The only thing is , it is a tight fit unless I take off my Bogen tripod plate and put it in the side pocket .  
1	  This product did not work . The audio only lasts 5-10 seconds . If I turn it off and then on or hit the resync button , I get 5-10 more seconds of audio . It doesn't matter how close I am to the base . I had recentely sent back my RS140 's to be fixed ( they worked great for 2 years ) . I won't be purchasing any refurbished units again .  
1	  I am extremely disappointed in this product . I have only had this DVD player for a couple days . I tried watching one of my favorite movies on it , only to have the player freeze after about 30 minutes . I could not get control back without cycling power . At first , I thought maybe there was something wrong with the movie , so I tried playing it in a friend 's player and on my computer . Both worked fine . I tried 3 other movies , all of which I have played successfully on my computer . All of the 3 experienced the same freeze up as the first . I examined the disks for signs of damage or dirtiness , but they were all clean and unscratched . So , I guess it 's back to watching movies on my computer . Sigh .  
2	  I have two of these - one at work and one at home . I am a professional designer and this is a pro tool . Fits my small hands great and works very well cordless .  
2	  Received a DIMM and not a SO-DIMM . The label on the package was clearly affixed manually and covered what had been there . Didn't need to open the package as what I could see was clearly much longer than what would fit in the laptop . Sent it back for replacement . Hopefully , I will get the correct one and not another mis-labelled DIMM . Update : Got the right part and it has worked fine .  
1	  Unfortunately the vender , Best Stop Electronics , didn't send me the promised Hitech charger . They sent me something called " Charger " which didn't charge batteries of the right type or even of that form factor . The charger wasn't even close . I wanted a charger that would support the Casio Exilim High Speed Camera ( NP40 batteries ) . I complained and after a slow response they tried again . Again they didn't send a Hitech charger , but a substitute . This charger also wasn't capable of charging my batteries . Wasn't a functional replacement for the Hitech charger . I give up at this point . My experience indicated that Best Stop Electronics was an amateurish company ; Amazon should screen their partners better .  
1	  There 's really only two things I want when I purchase crimp connectors .. for it to work ( of course ) and for it to click and hold securely into sockets . It does not do that latter . Not one of the entire bunch did , so it is either systematic error or extra cheap design .  
2	  I don't know how I went so long without this set up . It works just as it 's stated . I used to spend a lot of time opening and closing computer cases swapping drives , no more . This works like a charm .  
1	  After bolting the cable to the wall , I attempted to set the combination . In order to choose the combination you want , you use a flat head screw driver to unscrew and loosen the lock so you can rotate the number dials . Then , just tighten it up again . I did this . However , when I went to test out the combination I set , it didn't work ! And when I went to unscrew it to reset it , my attempts at unscrewing the cheap screw stripped the head and I was unable to reset it . I called the company and they said they would replace it but only if I sent them the old one . Now I have to spend my time and my money to get a cheap lock replaced . And , based on the other reviews of locks spontaneously changing combinations anyway , I wouldn't be surprised if this happened again .  
2	  this is one of the best sony product that i used . i use it for psp , camera , and as usb drive . it 's tiny shape always fill my memcard reader easily . the bad thing is that the card charger sometimes is not really good . that 's it  
2	  The product was delivered promptly . I have been using USB touchpad mini keyboards ever since there have been mini USB touchpad keyboards and this is my second or third one of this particular model . It works like a champ and is like an extension of my hands and arms . I hate mice , but I love touchpads and this is as good as they get . I would buy it if it cost twice as much ( thankfully it doesn't ) because that is how much I appreciate its functionality .  
1	  I bought a EX81LP / B about 1 yr ago . The sound is as good as I expected , but the cord began to fray after only 6 months . Now the metal wire inside exposes everywhere and makes this earphone a crap ! Just DON " T buy it ! unless you want a earphone that can last only half a year . Buy the Sennheiser CX300 or Creative EP630 . They are much better !  
2	  Perfect bargain basement accessory . First set was destroyed by my 6 yr old daughter before the Holiday . The second set , in pink and significantly cheaper than the first , is working wonderfully . Let 's hope she holds onto these a little longer . At $ 8 / pr in pink not to worry . Great all around entry-level earbud . A little bass heavy , but not completely overdone . Acquits itself rather nicely against much higher priced models .  
2	  I 've had this radio for a few weeks , and I think I can give an accurate review now . This is my first time having satellite radio , and I love it ! The station selection is awesome , but I will not go there because I am not reviewing XM . The Inno is sized about the same as an iPod , and it is really sleek ( and slick for that matter . ) As this is intended for all around use ( car , home , and portable ) it is very adaptable . I think it is very neat that when sitting sideways on the dock the Inno automatically switches sideways so you can look at the screen face on . The pad adjusts as well , so everything is very logical . Some of the main features that are impressive are : - The recording capability-even if you are almost all the way through the song you can get the whole thing ! - The bookmark capability . You can bookmark an artist or a particular song and anytime that artist or song is playing on any station the Inno will let you know so you can switch over . - The ability to create a " favorites " list of stations . - The ability to display the current song / artist on any given station . - The option to have sports / stock tickers running that shows scores , etc , while listening to the radio . OK , there 's a ton of useful options . Really , I just love being able to listen to what I want on a very cool little " toy . " Having never owned a satellite radio before , I am not an " expert " and I 'm sure this has flaws , but don't point them out to me . I will likely not hear you because I will be plugged into my radio !  
1	  After a little over a year the unit broke . It reboots every time I turn off the engine . After rebooting it cannot find GPS signal . Sometimes instead of rebooting it just hangs on the white and black screen , and I 'm not able to turn it off at all . I suspect the problem is with the battery . A few months earlier , it started giving me signs of warning by not finding GPS for a long time after being turned on . I paid about $ 250 for it a year ago , it is a high price tag for a year of usage ! This time I 'm going with Garmin which has a better reputation for reliablity .  
2	  I hooked up this monitor to my Dell P4 2.5G PC and played Need for speed underground on it with no negative video issues . The monitor is very adjustable - tilt up / down / left / right , and you can also tilt it horizontally . Colors are true and clear , and internet navigation views are very good . The only drawback I noticed was that some screen fonts are not crisp , & clean . Some fonts have jagged edges to them . But , overall I would recommend this monitor . Key Numbers-19 " Viewable Diagnonal3 year part & labor on site warrenty ( the only reason I considered it in the first place ) Monitor can be used Vertically , or HorizontallyComes with extra cable for dual monitor hookup .  
1	  This is definitely not an 8 gauge kit . The wire is cheap and the price reflects it . If you are looking to power and amplifier , do yourself a favor and buy a reputable amp kit . This won't do the job .  
1	  Hi i bought this webcam in brandsmart it cost me $ 20 when i got home i tried it everything was green so i thought of resarting my computer then i tried it again but nothing everything always came out black so plz dont waste $ 20 or $ 30 dollars on this !  
2	  I just bought this portable CD player at my local Wal-Mart and now I couldn't be happier . This is the best CD player I 've ever owned . It 's got a cool design and it plays CD 's very well . I would strongly recommend that people purchase this item .  
1	  I am frankly very disapointed that Amazon is " Spot-lighting " as highlights two glowing reviews from customers for this poor excuse for a DVD player . When the reviews are running 15 to 1 the other way and most folks who purchased this product are regretting it this is completely mis-leading . Worse still you have your own product review which is completely false . I had this player all of three months before it wouldn't hardly play at all . It finally died all together some months later after very little use . The warrantly was worthless . Also , this product is not made in Korea or Malaysia as has been advertised but China , where quality control , at least for this product doesn't exist . I have written over 65 reviews for Amazon and this is the first negative review I have written . How about truth in advertising . Shame on you for posting glowing reviews of this product . Apex is junk . Thank you , Christian Lehrer  
2	  Pros : First of all , it feels really good in hand . I 've played with other brands for quite a while , like tiffen , hoya / kenko , and the really cheap zeikos , and this was my first B + W product . It is well made with high class material . Your hand will tell the difference immediately . Secondly , the MRC really works . It looks like the glass is not there at all ( of course there is still reflection if you look from a lower angle ) . Once again , I believe the product is # 010M , not # 010 . Amazon has the wrong info . Cons : The water / dust resistive coating is not quite as advertised . It catches dust as easily as other brands ( and my glasses ) . I heard that even keys could not scratch this coating , but I don't want to try this myself , even though I believe good glass must be harder than keys ( Mohs scale 7 vs 4 ) . It is also a little pricey .. well , at least for me . I 'm using it for my Tamron 18-270 , and it definitely costs more than 10 % of the lens value ..  
1	  This means for moving the input on the keyboard to the mother board , is inconsistent , unreliable and a pain to work with . Basically this product is sitting to one side since I cannot return it . My other experience with Logitec , has been positive so the experience with this combination was a distinct letdown .  
1	  I have owned 3 or 4 of these cameras , my first one was quite by accident , received it in payment for driving for someone . The second one did not do to well , this one that I got from Amazon works JUST LIKE IT IS SUPPOSED to work , it took me through a 50 year high school reunion with shining colors ! It was interesting to photograph all around this boarding school , many things had changed , but many were similar or the same . I have MANY pictures now that I can look at to remind me of my 50th anniversary of my graduation . Thanks , Amazon , you did well ! Richard L. Opp ( thoseopps @ yahoo . com )  
1	  Save yourself $ 10 and buy a jar of mayonnaise , you 'll get the same results smearing that all over your screen . Guess I shouldn't be surprised buying a product from a company known for selling ( scamming ) overpriced " premium " audio cables . A one star review is the lowest you can give . It 's also generous for this product .  
1	  XP / Win7 doesn't know how to get the driver , find dekcell web said work till XP , not driver available for download . Don't buy !  
1	  Three complaints : 1 . The LOADING issue is a HUGE problem . Within the 90-day warranty , I experienced the problem and called JVC . They said that the unit had a recall and to send it in for a repair for free . JVC kindly repaired it and sent it back . Within a year , the SAME LOADING issue came back . I sent it in for a second time , and JVC repaired for free again . 2 . I bought the unit to dub my home video VHS tapes and Digital 8 tapes to DVD-R 's . I was able to do this but when I placed into my Media Center HP desktop , it did not recognize the format that JVC recorded the video in . I guess JVC has their own . This makes it difficult when trying to edit , pick and choose scenes from the JVC recorded DVD-R . 3 . The JVC recorder has the options to insert chapters when recording video . However , after you have finished and you finalize the DVD , all of those chapters disappear and the unit automatically inserts chapters every 5 minutes . Not sure if this is a JVC thing or a general DVD recording thing .  
2	  I USED TO CARRY MY MACBOOK IN A BACKPACK .. BUT THAT GOT WAY TOO BULKY .. THIS BAC FITS THE 13 INCH MACBOOK LIKE A GLOVE .. HAS AMPLE POCKETS FOR USB CABLES , CHARGERS , AND THE POWER SUPPLY .. IT FEELS GREAT HANGING OFF OF MY SHOULDER ..  
1	  it 's such a cutie , shame the batteries don't last long enough for you to use it properly . also i can't get to grips with the settings before i take any pics , otherwise a real bargain . something to give the kids to let them learn how to use , so they can show me . I CAN'T KEEP STILL TO TAKE ANY STILL PICTURES .  
2	  I 'm amazed bt the quality of this product for the price . It has all of the adjustments of the $ 200 tripods . Very lite , easy to carry ( it has a carrying handle ) . I love the quick-release . You mount your camera and instead of unscrewing it every time , it has a thum switch to release . Just like the more expensive models .  
1	  I have been a faithful SONY customer all my life ( TV , Computer , Laptop , Camera , Home Theatre , etc ) until I bought my latest KDL-46S2000 ; then things changed . For starter , it has only one HDMI port ; which means , you can either get HD reception from your Cable or Satellite antenna , or your DVD player , or Camcorder . To get around it , you have to unhook one , and hook the other one , every time ; it is very inconviniant and unpleasant . The picture quality is OK , but I compare that to my Sony Tube TV , and not with similar LCD HD TV 's in the same price range ; if compared with others , Panasonic and Samsung provide much better quality , brightness , and speed . Speed ? Yes , speed . When you watch an action movie , sports , or any fast moving TV program , the TV freezes ; or a big portion of screen turns into Chess type squares with fuzzy colors . I know I have been a loyal customer of SONY , but looking at this product , I know I would have had a much better TV if I were looking at other brands . And that 's what I will do the next time I buy any electronic product .  
1	  Hey dudes , I like really these headphones both for comfort and sound .. but now after very little total use I am looking for my third pair of pads in three years at a cost of $ 25 a set ( $ 75 and counting ) . My old Sennheiser headphones / pads ( that I still have ) lasted 25 years ! Pathetic , I only use them for watching movies when the wife is asleep , a few hours a month max . And NO I am not abusing them , they stay in a cabinet in a velvet bag . You will need to replace pads every other year due to flaking off .. I will ( god only knows ) maybe have to buy 10 more pairs in the future ? Rrr .. notice on Amazon replacement pads are bought really OFTEN .. crazy . Sony products are beautiful , cutting edge and often great to use .. but a two year life span due to poor durability ? Bah .. If you are a fan of Sony products then this will review will annoy . But two close friends who bought these on my recommendation have had the exact problem . Both also walked around work with black specks stuck to their faces not knowing what the source was .. * UPDATE * Please read the review of this Sony products ' earcups at the following competitors ' earcup replacements have been used by a dozen other owners ( a suitable replacement there ) at Beyerdynamic EDT 200 ear cushions . They state the problem better then me and if you buy this product these Sony cups will most likely disintegrate on you within a year 's time ( or two etc . ) . I bought a set of those new velour ones and am VERY happy almost two years now . Thanks folks for the kind update ( those of you have expressed discontent at me bringing up a valid and established issue .. Well , please just let the ' easy fix ' be published instead of comment on your ' feelings ' on hundred dollar headphones needing almost immediate replacement ) .. take care all you wonderful other Amazon update people who have helped and assisted and gave updates all over the forums here :) .. go Amazon feedback !  
1	  Not recommended . This otherwise comfy keyboard doesn't have enough juice to charge an ipod through its second USB port . I wish I 'd opened the box earlier and found this out when I could still have exchanged it . I 'm very disappointed .  
2	  I bought an I-Pod about a year ago , and those little earbuds hurt . I 've never met a single person who actually kept those things . At any rate , I knew I had to get a good pair of ear - or head-phones . So , I started looking around . After seeing all the positive reviews for this product , I decided to buy and haven't regretted it once . Here are some pointers for anyone thinking of buying these : 1 ) The foam inserts cause much more suction than the plastic ones ( at least , for me ) . Because of this , if you 're using while riding a bike , either use two plastic inserts or one plastic and one foam , as you 'll be able to pick up on background noise better . 2 ) I saw someone who complained of breathing and heartbeats distracting them while working out . This is a very easy problem to fix . As I said in the previous statement , the plastic inserts create less suction . Simply adjust the plastic inserts in your ear until you can no longer hear your heartbeats and breathing . Don't worry ' you 'll still be able to hear the music perfectly . These are very high-quality earphones . I haven't had a single problem with them . If you decide to buy these , I 'm sure you will be very happy with your purchase , just like I am !  
1	  This case is definitely not what I expected from the pictures and reviews . It looks and feels very cheap and flimsy . The fact that it is impossible to hotsync while using it just adds to the frustration . Definitely not a match for such a fine product as my Palm Vx .  
1	  Product has ripped three times , after hours of sewing and mending , it barely holds up to treadmill running and weight lifting . The " plastic " material is cheap and terribly easy to fracture , the neoprene material is good , the velcro works great . Don't leave your sansa in the thing after running , it will cause the back to oxidize . Find another product for the run !  
2	  The best at this price . Like the color and functions . Mine has latest longer than some comparable higher end models . Life saver when trying to keep a busy life organized . Great optional backlight feature .  
2	  This is the third portable , usb speaker I 've purchased for my laptops . But , this is the only one that actually works , and it works very well . Crisp , clear sound that has good volume ( as compared to the other small speakers , which were barely an improvement over the built-in laptop speakers ) and a good range of sound . You don't have to install the software that comes with it , which I couldn't do because it 's not supported on Windows Vista . But , even without the software , it is brilliant . I 'm going to buy another one for my other laptop now ! UPDATE 3/3/2010 : After almost 3 years , this speaker is still going strong for me . Fantastic !  
1	  I was looking forward to using this recorder after I received it for Christmas and indeed started transfering some VHS tapes to DVD . From the beginning this machine gave me trouble . It would stop and freeze up when it was trying to format a new disc for recording at 98 % complete and would not respond to anything , so I had to pull the power cord to reset it . A few times I had recorded a program and when I go to finalize the DVD , it had some error and did not record . Also after about 7 months ( I hadn't used it that much ) , It started making a loud humming noise while it was pluged in but not being used . I had to start unplugging it ! Now , a couple days ago , I went to record a program and it would not even format a new disc . I tried 3 different discs ( of good quality ) and the stupid thing could not get past 98 % complete . I 'm glad I didn't spend my money on it , but unfortunately a family member did . My advice : Buy a name brand thats been around awhile , like sony etc . Sorry :(  
2	  I 've had this little device now for maybe 3 years , upgraded from the starter h1915 ( don't laugh , it was good for its time ) . All I can say is I 'm always amazed by the hx2415 's versatility . I keep up with hundreds of documents with it , something that would be a tree 's nightmare 10 years ago ; and it doesn't miss a beat when opening any of them . Being able to quickly and easily access WAPs is definitely its best feature . I usually can find myself jumping on the ' net to look up something ( many times to prove someone wrong ) , and while it does take WiFi a bit to come " online " , once it does it 's only a matter of bringing up internet exploder and I 'm off ! Not to mention the gaming capability .. and being able to watch full DVDs ( with the appropriate purchased software ) with stunning clarity ! The only negative I can offer is the 64MB of RAM / ROM . While the unit can handle most app memory requirements pretty well , there are some memory hogs that make me wish I had waited for the more beefier 128MB model . This is still far superior to many , though . It 's a hand-held entertainment system ( can't wait for my 16 GB CF Card to arrive ) .  
2	  I have been quite delighted with my Samsung ML-1210 printer . Although I 'm still on the original toner cartridge , I figured I better purchase a couple replacements for the time it runs out of toner . I received my new cartridges in 3 days with standard shipping . Amazon prices are lower then Best Buy wanted when I purchased the printer . Of course , Best Buy no longer has the cartridges available for purchase . Good job Amazon !  
1	  I purchased this case with my Canon S5 IS . What a waste of money . While the case is made well enough , it is the most poorly designed case I have ever encountered . The case has a belt loop , but no actual strap . It is made to hang from the camera 's strap . I am 6 feet tall and , with the camera strap around my neck , there is no way that I could attach the belt loop to my pants . The case also has a small snap loop that you can use to dangle the case from the camera strap 's right side , but then it would interfere with the operation of the camera itself . Beside the fact that there is no good way to store the camera case when you take the camera out , the case is too small anyway . My S5 barely fits inside and , invariably , I knock the lens cap off while trying to wiggle the camera into place . Also , there is only one small mesh compartment on the case ( which is on the inside ) and it is barely large enough to store an extra set of four batteries . Since the pouch is just elastic mesh , the spare batteries tend to fall out if you tip the case . Save your money and avoid the aggravation of this case . For the moment , I 've switched to a CaseLogic camera case that I bought at Wal-Mart for under $ 7 . I like the new case much better .  
1	  I returned it because the space key was excessively noisy when pressed ( a very loud clunk ) and required excessive force to depress . It was annoying and slowed my typing down dramatically . ( I 'm also not sure I like the " split " design , but I probably would have gotten used to that . ) NOTE : at a local Staples , I found an example of this model ( albeit much more pricey at $ 49 on sale marked down from $ 59 ) which when I tried it hands-on had a much looser and quieter space bar .. maybe Microsoft has fixed the problem , but the supply chain still has the defective ones on sale . Conclusion : don't buy this keyboard sight-unseen , but if you can buy it in a store for a reasonable price and it doesn't have the loud space bar , then go for it . Just make them open the box before you buy if possible , because if you get stuck with a noisy one , you 'll lose your marbles .  
1	  This bulky , sturdy-looking little camera plate arrived and is totally unusable . This should be a simple device : push the lever , release the plate , right ? Well , the lever simply doesn't move , despite what the " helpful " diagram indicates it should do . Feeling like an idiot , I handed to 4 or 5 other folks and none of us , examining the included documentation and device could get the thing to release its death grip on the " quick " release plate . In desperation , I went looking for a contact number for Manfrotto customer support . No such luck , just an email form . This one is getting returned - I 'm mightily unimpressed that such an expensive little gadgetA . Doesn't work out of the box . B. Doesn't include a good customer service solution when things go awry .  
1	  I live in a rural mountain area approximately 40 miles west of Denver CO and own a fairly nice AM / FM Boston Acoutics tabletop radio with a built in AM antenna . The Terk Advantage antenna impoved the reception only slightly . Maybe it is where I live in the mountains , but I was disappointed , to say the least . The antenna was returned to the seller .  
2	  My husband wanted a shower radio for a long time , and picked up a cheap one at Bed Bath and Beyond . As one might expect , it stopped working within six months . I ordered this radio to surprise Hubby , and we 've both been really pleased with it . The sound quality and reception are great . It came in handy during a freak March snowstorm that took out our power , leaving us without lights or other sources of entertainment for more than four hours . At that point we 'd had the radio for about a month and had to replace the batteries shortly afterward , but haven't since . This radio was a good buy and we 're both pleased with it .  
1	  This is a basic antenna . It works as well on digital as it did 50 years ago with analog TV - Not well if you are more than a few miles from the television station .  
2	  First , Samsung could pack it much better . I had to return the first unit because of a huge dent on the DVD chassis . Amazon sent a replacement next business day so I wouldn't complain much about this . I didn't expect it perform as $ 1000-HTSystems when I placed my order . But I have to say it performs pretty well considering it 's a sub-$250 system . Pros : 1 . Adequate power to accommodate a small / med-size living room or a bedroom . ( 80watts x5speakers and 100watts x 1 subwoofer , total of 500Wrms ) 2 . Progressive scan and 3-2 pull down . PQ is really good . 3 . Multi-language support for MP3 discs . Not sure of what languages are supported . So far i was able to use cdr 's in Japanese , Korean and English . ( MP3 GUI could be better . ) 4 . Chassis fan to cool off the unit . 5 . Customizable Menu Background . Cons : 1 . No Coaxial Digital Audio input . ( it does have an optical input . ) 2 . It cuts off signals from other sources whenever disc eject button is pressed even though you 're not watching DVD movies . 3 . No component cable ? i wouldn't use theirs but still .. 4 . Remote control has a lot of room to improve . 5 . Proprietary speaker connectors and wires . Despite it lacks some of features ; DB600 is a definite keeper for me . You can't simply beat the value , performance and features of this HTS . * Update * After a month of use , i 'm loving it . i don't know if there 's any other HTS ( under $ 200 ) does everything DB600 does . You will love DVD movies with DTS . It brings a theater-like experience to your living room . yet i still think their remote control is worst thing i 've ever seen . it probably has a range of 15 degrees off of any axis otherwise it 'll not work . the reviewer above said there 's no audio output . well , there " IS " one . a headphone jack is located in front of the unit . so with a right cable , you should be able to output audio to any device . but then why would you want to copy a DVD to VHS ? not to mention Macrovision will prevent you from copying DVDs anyways . if you still need copying feature , you might want to check out Zenith XBS344 HTS . it has a DVD / VHS combo player and costs about the same .  
2	  My telescope was unbroken and had all the parts , the collimation was dead on , assembly straightforward . The EQ mount is not made well but is serviceable , the problem is it 's designed for up to a 7 pound scope the 127eq weighs 17 pounds so yes the whole assembly is shaky . ( edit ) the eq mount has two bolts at the top and at the rear , behind a plastic cap , tightening these nuts greatly improves the stability of the mount . The tripod is fine . Finderscope has a single holder bracket making it extremely difficult to line up with the telescope , I recommend buying an aftermarket finderscope or modifying the one Celestron provides . I found the eyepieces to be satisfactory even the barlow . For the price this is a great scope in my opinion , my first view of Jupiter was crisp and clear and the moons were sharp and bright . I have heard it is hard to collimate a scope of this design as it has a corrector lens at the bottom of the focuser . I have read that if you remove the focuser tube ( the silver part , take out the two screws holding the knob in place and pull it out ) then remove the retaining ring and remove the corrector lens you can collimate like a normal reflector scope . Be sure to put the lens back in the same way meaning don't flip it over and reassemble . I included that for anyone having trouble with their scope being out of collimation . I 'm glad I bought mine , now if the weather would only cooperate .  
1	  I bought this camera in December of 2005 for a family gift . After reading all the reviews on this and other cameras , I was very excited about having a camera that would take great pictures , per the reviews . Oh .. it does take good pictures .. but I can not get the pictures off the camera . From the very first , we had problems with the software , which is a real pain to get to work right . I transfered 4 pictures to my computer and those are the last pictures we have been able to get off the camera . We even installed the software to another computer and it still won't work . First it identifies the camera , then it says " camera can't be found " . Since the camera seems to working properly , it now appears that the USB cable is bad . I have contacted Kodak , furnished them my receipt , and requested a new cable . They advise that there is not a problem with the cable and .. get this .. the cable is NOT covered by the warranty . If I want , they will be happy to ship me another , once I pay [ .. ] . So , either I buy another cable .. which at this date is only 6 months old and never worked properly to start with .. or purchase another camera . I now have a camera that takes great pictures but does me no good . If you are thinking about buying this camera .. think long and hard . It 's not worth the money and Kodak does not stand behind their product . This is the last Kodak product I will buy .  
1	  As with a previous user , the connection became loose very quickly ( within 2 weeks ) and does not provide a good connection between the power pack and cord to the computer . I am purchasing a different product .. too bad , I loved the idea and design of this one . Not recommended .  
2	  The Epson Workforce 520 uses 5 ink cartridges , 2 black and 3 color so the dual twin pack is a good buy . I highly recommend it . I can't say that I 've found a great improvement in print quantity between the regular cartridge T125 and the high caacity cartridge T126 but I don't count the pages printed either . For that reason I tend to buy T125 , but I always get the dual twin pack black T125 . Both T125 and T126 will work fine and Amazon is dependable for delivery , always a few days before expected . I Like Amazon .  
2	  " Restless " performs a neat trick in paralleling the past and the present stories then melting the two into one . One small complaint : the Reuben Jones , the destroyer sunk by the Germans in the book , was in fact the Reuben James in real life . I 'm surprised at a writer as good as Boyd is would let a small fact like this not be double checked . Inexcusable .  
1	  I was really excited to get this filter but it didn't meet my expectations from the start . When I opened it the ring that holds the glass in place was partially popped out . I figured I would work to get it back in and when I did I noticed that the ends of it didn't meet . Should you accidently drop the filter or something hit it , I wouldn't be surprised if the glass popped out . Further , when I tried it on my dslr the results were not near what I expected . I 'm not saying it completely horrible ; I only took a few shots and I 'll need to try it out in different environments to see if it works any better . Overall , however , I was dissapointed in the quality , esp for the price I paid . I 've bought $ 10 filters that worked far better than this .  
1	  You could not print 3 pages continously without jamming ( the printer would pick up 2 to 3 pages from the paper tray at the same time and end up jam itself ) . The only way to get around is to manually feed the paper one by one . I have noticed this problem ever since I got it as a gift ( it 's the reason I did not return it ) . I think it 's a product design flaw . I hope anyone who is thinking about buying this printer see this message .  
1	  If i could give this product a zero , i would . The outlet charger worked for a minutes then I said let me try the usb port . That was a disappointment . Car charger was also a disappointment . Do not waste gour money , time and shipping charges to ship back this product . Go and buy with gomadic , they are a bit more expensive but it works .  
2	  Pleased with both Amazon and the TV . Delivery was prompt , professional and free ! Television is great . Nicest thing about it is that the engineers clearly put some thought into the user interface . It 's simple , intuitive , and elegant . Picture is wonderful , basic sound is a little better than expected . I looked at plasmas for about 2 months - this was the right choice .  
1	  THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT I 'VE EVER BOUGHT ! IT 'S OLD , IT DOESNT WORK PROPERLY . THE AD SAID NEW , IT WASNT NEW AT ALL . NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE . I 'LL NEVER TRUST THIS VENDER AGAIN .  
2	  This worked out just as I had hoped . The remote has all the buttons necessary to control my cable box , DVD player , satellite , and tv . Like it so much I wanted to buy another for the bedroom . But it works only on one frequency , so you can't have more than one in your house . Looks like I 'll need to buy a more expensive model that lets you change the ID of each of the boxes so I can have multiple in the same home .  
1	  Sound and quality are really great but after 1 month of use the display has stopped functionong . Therefore , I don't know what channel I am on or what channel I am tuning to .  
2	  This backpack is great , there of good quality and plenty of padding for those bumps in life . the pocket could be positioned better and could be sized better . other than that great pack for your small note book computer .  
2	  We picked this up so we could hook our computer up to the HDTV . For the most part it works fine ! Every now and then it decides not to type . It worked fine for this review !  
1	  The tiny media cards arrived in a huge box .. so much for the environment . But more disappointing , one of the media cards is completely dead after just a few uses . I bought these to be used in a Canon digital SLR and a Dell PC laptop . One media card is completely dead and can't be read / formatted by either the camera or the PC . A quick internet search seems to indicate a similar problem with the Transcend cards for other users . Buyer beware .  
2	  Pretty good in quality and easy to use . I used pressure cookers before many years ago . This stainless steel one offers the convenience and time-saving in cooking , especially in cooking those foods that take a long time to cook . The size fits the needs of small to median families well . Personally , I would like it to be a little larger in diameter and shorter in height .  
2	  Needed a 6 pin to 6 pin cable . NONE available locally so ordered this . Came fast and worked great to move info from an old iMac to a new iMac .  
2	  Excellant transfer time It went on a photo safari and performed very wellOver 600 photo and video .  
2	  I didn't think I would be too into the whole Tivo thing when I bought this for my husband , but WOW , it relly does change how you watch tv ! I just wish I would have bought the 80-hr . one , so I wouldn't have to wonder when shows might be deleted to make room for new ones . This one works excellent though , it did stop and reboot a couple times since we had it , but I 'm sure it needed to do so to run properly . Nothing erases when this happens , it just takes about 5 or 6 minutes to start up again , everything is still there when it comes back . Just so you know if you by one , you do have to pay for monthly service and it does need to be connected to a phone line ( I had to run a 50 ft . cord long the ceiling from my kitchen since our living room doesn't have a hookup ) .  
1	  After 1 defective drive and 4 coasters , I would say this drive has by far been one of the biggest computer headaches I 've ever dealt with . It doesn't burn at 8x even with the appropriate media . If you are planning on backing up home movies , I would strongly urge against this drive as the backups I have made freeze at the 12 minute mark . Back to the store !  
2	  A few have complained that the color on this model Palm is dim . I can tell you that mine is not dim at all . In fact , I was pleasantly surprised at how bright it is both with the backlight off and with it on ! Mine was made in the USA , and I understand that some may be made in another country . Perhaps the ones not made in the USA are dimmer ? Or perhaps only the first run older ones had that problem and it has since been fixed . These are just guesses since mine is absolutely not dim at all ! I have owned several Palms previously ; II , IIx , IIxe , and V. The m505 is by far my favorite Palm so far ! The color screen is wonderful . It makes the unit much more user friendly and easier to read overall . It 's quite easy to read with the backlight off under normal lighting conditions such as under a desk lamp or in a meeting room , etc . When the need arises , you can turn on the backlight ( such as in a very dark room like in bed at night or when you just want the screen to look really bright ) . Under both circumstances , the screen looks wonderful and is quite readable . The color makes it more fun to use and I 've downloaded some shareware games to play for the true arcade experience , in a palm size ! The m505 is blazing fast ! It 's noticeably faster than any of my previous Palms ! It also comes with the latest Palm OS 4.0 verison . It 's also very quiet . I was expecting the color screen to buzz but I can hardly hear anything at all with the backlight on and off ! I would recommend this model because it 's one of the smallest Palms available ( which means you will conveniently carry it with you everywhere ) and it 's got color , which is a great asset since most software applications nowadays are optimized for color . I do not miss my greyscale non color Palms at all ! If you are concerned that the screen might be a bit dim like other reviewers have reported , I suggest either buying locally so you can see the actual unit you are getting , or purchasing from a vendor that will let you return it . All I need now is a wireless modem setup and I 'll be doing full color web-browsing and emailing from my Palm ! You gotta love it !  
1	  Where to start .. For the price point I would have expected a much higher quality product , my coworker led me on to this product however he had a much older version . The difference between them were astronomical . 1st , the item I received did not match the picture , mine is a much cheaper looking knock off , not sure how that happened . 2nd , as soon as I plugged in the usb into the adapter and took it out , it broke , just like that . in under 1 minute my brand new device turned to crap , the usb port is so loose and cheap it amazes me they get away with it . 3rd , it drops connection consistently , if you are using hyper terminal or other similar programs ( putty ) you will relieve and error and have to reopen the session which is the most annoying thing in the world when trying got configure a switch or a node . Overall bad experience , product seems WAY to overpriced for the cheap piece of garbage you get for it , I would pay 5 dollars for this and be happy but 20 dollars plus I don't think so . This product is the perfect example of made in china at its finest and I would avoid it , find something cheaper and better .  
1	  I purchased this TV in August 2006 , and it quit working around March 2008 . ( less than 15 months ! ) Apparently Olevia utilizes the substandard Darfon V144 back light inverter board . When the board goes , so does the TV . Of course you can purchase a new board online for about $ 200 . But why invest that amount , when you can add another $ 200 , and purchase a new and better TV.I 'm really disappointed with the Olevia brand . I guess that 's why you see so many of them for sale online . And their either refurbished or open box . I 'm sure a lot of customers are returning Olevias due to their unreliability . Do yourself a favor and buy a Panasonic , Sharp , Sony , Samsung or RCA product . Trust me ; being cheap in the beginning , is really not worth it in the end . I learned the hard way .  
1	  the cd player didnt work but again the ups did pick up within one day of my emailing . The service is excellent but unfortunately the cds didnt work in the player  
1	  I received this strap and have decided to return it prior to actually using it . Although it appears well constructed , it is very rigid , wide in the area right at the neck and the inside surface isn't smooth - kind of wrinkled . Seems like it will be uncomfortable . Not well enough padded for the weight of DSLRs . Not worth the risk of not liking it after use for this price .  
1	  I bought this because it was an MP3 player with wi-fi , I thought it would be a good alternative to my iPod touch and I could give that to my apple loving brother . I had no idea your getting useless wifi with no keyboard or touchscreen . So you can't access the internet at all . Why give a product wi-fi if it can't be used for internet browsing ? I think iPod is an overly expensive brand ; and there is no reason this wouldn't be better than an iPod nano or shuffle ; but the iPod touch is actually useful at places that offer wi fi , like McDonald 's or Starbucks if you need information off of the internet . ( email , directions , get a hotel , make a phone call with skype ) Do not buy this product as a competitor for an iPod touch , buy it as a mp3 player you can get cheaply ; closest comparison is to Sony Walkman .  
1	  Good price .. but , player skips too much . I thought it was a bad MP3 rip or CD burn . I heard a large skip and replayed . Skip wasn't there . Did this several times at different locations . This would indicate the CD was OK and the player was skipping . Skipping will start annoying you to the point that you wished you paid more for a better player . Also , CD must be carefully inserted and firmly pressed into place . Otherwise , the player can't read the CD .  
2	  I listen to audio books while mobile - walking , yard work , cleaning . I can't tell you how many cassette tape players I 've dropped and broken because they fell out of the tape player carrier . That will never happen again due to Tune Belt . The pocket is secured shut by a 4 " x7 " strip of Velcro . The belt itself is wide , very comfortable , and adjustable . I highly reccomend this product .  
2	  It has nice grippy pads that hold the iPad in place . it I s very secure so you can actually use the stand as a handle to hold the device . From behind . It is actually quite a bit more comfortable than holding the tablet bare .  
2	  I purchased this camera for my 11-yr old daughter to use in a summer photography gifted & talented art class that required the kids to bring an SLR camera ( I got a reconditioned model really cheap ) . What a find ! I bought it because it seemed much easier to use than a standard SLR ( which befuddle me ) , but I didn't expect that the pictures or adjustability would be that great - I was terribly wrong . There was no discernable difference between my daughter 's photos and the photos from the kids ( most older & more seasoned in photography ) who used a standard SLR - except she said that she got to take more pictures because she wasn't always messing with her camera . Her photos included color , black & white , landscapes , close-ups , and many " trick " shots with long exposures and light effects - everything the other kids did with their cameras . He teacher even recommended that she enter a couple of her photos in a local contest ! The " one step " buttons for landscapes , close-ups , long exposure , and short exposure produce excellent results , and the automatic speed setting with the manual f-step option is very nice as well - no charts or graphs needed to figure it all out . My husband and I have always been interested in photography , but we never wanted to deal with the complicated SLR lenses , F-stop / speed settings , etc . , but we were so impressed with the IS20 that we just purchased another one for our own use , and intend on doing a little hobby SLR photography ourselves ! The IS20 actually makes photography fun ! I 've taken the best photos of my life in the past few days , and I 'm excited to continue . I HIGHLY RECOMMEND for the beginning or even intermediate SLR user .  
1	  I strongly urge you to NOT BUY THIS MACHINE ! You have to replace the drum unit every 3-4 toners . They told me this at Brother after I bought my printer and it started splotching after the 4th toner .  
2	  This is a great device and worked just as advertised . The one issue we had is that the IR extension cable did not work . Not sure if the cable is bad or something else . But , since the main unit has it 's own IR blaster on the front of it , it has worked just fine for my needs . It is pretty cool that something in the battery compartment can sense the IR being sent out of the front of the remote to then send it over the radio instead . Works like magic :) All in all a pretty cool product that works well , with the exception I mentioned above .  
2	  My new BEL Vector 955 radar detector is working well and has already saved me a couple of tickets . Range is excellent on highway up to a mile . Some false laser signals in city . Auto mute is a nice function & each frequency has it 's own audio alert . I have always been happy with BEL radar detectors & I 'm pleased with this one .  
1	  I bought it because it was priced well and had the HD upconvert feature . Recording was no problem - no issues there . My problems were with playback . The player began showing the alternate language subtitles on store-purchased movies . I could not turn OFF this feature - it had a mind of it 's own . The last straw was skipping from chapter to chapter - in random order , again on store-purchased movies . This piece of junk now resides on the garbage , where it belongs !  
1	  I bought this unit when it first came out , and while it is charming and certainly does do many things , it is not a robust unit . The processor is tiny and strains to play high-quality files . It records well enough , but there are limitations and restrictions to how you encode or store the files . Granted it is very cheap and for what you pay , it does do a heck of alot . I might be cheap , but I am an audio / videophile with over 30,000 mp3 's , just as many pics , and all my DVD 's converted to digital copy .. and alas this unit just won't do . So a year or so later I found something that actually plays VOB files in their native format ! Hallelujah ! It 's about $ 50 more but 100 % worth it . The Neuros was nice and certainly ahead of it 's time but like the pre-cursors to the iPod , something better did come along without breaking the bank :) Don't get me wrong , this little guy is still attached to my TV , but that is because many of the recordings I made with it simply won't play on anything else ;( . But I also have the BM3030 hooked up to that TV and the 3 others in my home for a reason . I am able to stream my entire 9-TeraByte digital library from my home server to the BM3030 .. check it out : MyHD Media Extender and Recorder BM3030  
2	  I had an Olympus C750UZ ( 10x zoom ) and was looking to get something smaller that took better quality movies and had a better ( simpler ) menu system - the Olympus can be very complex and caused me to record the first movies after my daughters birth with no sound - argh . After much research I found that you can not find a PERFECT camera but the Canon SD550 was about as close as you could get . I 've had non-digital Canon cameras in the past so I trusted the name . After a few weeks of getting to know the camera I can say that I am overall extremely pleased with it . The menus are simple yet the features are complete . You don't have to press a million buttons to get something to work or figure out which mode you are in before you set something you thought you remembered seeing somewhere in there .. just a nice simple layout . Getting into macro mode is very simple and even better it focuses right on and works really well . Switching between photo and movie mode is easy enough and the movies are of such better quality than my Oly . The sound is also great when recording movies .. I could easily hear the conversation being had when I was filming a family outing at a park from 50 + feet away - gotta remember to remove them from my will . The only thing I do not like about the camera is that it tends to make redeye appear more often than other cameras I have used . Even with the redeye reduction setting on I just can't shake it . This may be user error and I hope to figure that out soon but even so the redeye is easy enough to fix in iPhoto so it doesn't concern me so much . One really cool feature is how the screen tilts the picture automatically for you when you rotate the camera for landscape vs portrait shot - very cool . Overall , Canon did a really great job on this camera .. and it is so small yet feels solidly built and has enough weight to it to do the job . Get a second battery so you can swap when needed - I bought the Lenmar Canon equivalent and so far so good . I am very pleased with my purchase .  
1	  This didn't work . The program I am using it for crashes when I select the COM port that this thing is emulating . It 's better just to buy the PCI card with serial ports on it .  
1	  How could I give you my opinion on the product that I have not received ?  
1	  I am amazed that other persons report success with this device - I wonder if mine is broken out of the box ! The CD that came with it would not install any software automatically so I was forced to examine the files on the CD and make guesses as to what to execute . These were invariably incorrect decisions and after hours of struggle I gave up and sent a message to the manufacturer asking for help . I got back a PHD dissertation in computer science and after following the directions just ended up with a crashed program and complete failure to capture any video at all . This is a very risky product to buy and if you take a chance on it be prepared to do great deal of research in computer science before expecting any results at all !  
2	  great product . very versitile . Takes some time to get used to the software , but not really difficult after the first few times . Works with Windows 7 which is great . Support seems good too .  
2	  This is an excellent strap for our NEX 7 . It is light and small yet strong enough for any lens combo . Highly recommended .  
2	  These earbuds are by far the best ones on the market for the money ! The sound quality is phenominal ! They cancel out sound really well even though that was not their intended purpose . They sound great on all kinds of music from hip-hop to large orchestral classic style music . The amount of bass that comes from these little earbuds rival my pro dj grade headphones . By far some of the best head phones on the market . If you are reading this and you have not bought these yet , go and buy a pair right now !  
1	  The product is great - works like a charm .. but OOPS ! It doesn't come with cables ! No wonder it was such a great deal . You are better off finding one that comes with all the appropriate cables unless you have them already .  
2	  Bought this receiver since it has pre-amp output . Needed this feature as I am using wireless speakers ( JBL ) for the surround channels . The wireless speakers have their own amplifier and cannot be used with full amplifier outputs . This feature is only found on more expensive receivers from any manufacturer . To find it on a receiver retailing for $ 300 is quite a surprise . Of course the trade off is the lack of HDMI but I am not aware of any receiver processing the audio part of the HDMI connection . Based on other reviews , I am sure it will sound good when it arrives . Manual is huge .  
1	  they sound like you are in a tunnel . If you are a real music lover and don't use music just for backround noise or distraction on the treadmill , you will not like these . Luckily , I didn't buy them for myself .  
1	  We bought 3 of these cameras for christmas presents at the Walmart after Thanksgiving sale and thought they would be great gifts . 2 of the 3 are completely dead , they will not even turn on when you add brand new batteries . The third one will turn on with brand new batteries but the battery idicator slowly runs down to nothing and then the camera shuts off . It doesn't matter what type of batteries we put in the camera . DO NOT BUY ! You will be very disappointed . We thought they were great when they worked asside from the red eye issue which could be photoshopped out . Now they are unusable . The 30 day warrenty is over for walmart so we are hunting for new cameras .  
2	  This remote control does what it says its supposed to do . It 's constructed more solid than previous models . It recognizes the vast majority of any device you can throw at it . All you do it enter the model # of your tv , vcr , dvd player , or even your nintendo wii . If by chance it didn't have your device it will learn from your existing remote . The battery charge last for weeks at a time . Yes , I did say its rechargable . I recommend it to everyone even if your a little challenged with computers . It helps you along the way nicely .  
1	  My little one really wanted one , so I succumbed , and as soon as it came , I knew it wouldn't last long . The USB connector actually is ON THE TOY ! After less than 20 times of using , it has stopped working , the light has stayed on , and no computer will recognize it . I think for a child under 9 or 10 , an inexpensive " generic " mp3 plyer from WALMART or online at Amazon would be preferable . One good thing is that hte volume is VERY low , which I think is a good thing for children to get used to .  
2	  these banana plugs are very nice , and they are pretty heavy meaning they are solid and built well . Even though they are a little pricey , they are definately worth the extra $ 10 to spend on these plugs vs . others . The ease of installation is also a plus . The install is clean , leaving no wires hanging out .  
1	  I bought this player ( .. ) . The player died within less than a year . There is an annoying problem : the media tray opens and immediately closes whenever you push the open / close button . I have to pull the tray quickly to be able to put my DVD / CD in . Sounds ridiculous ? This is the worst electronics i have ever bought . I will avoid any products from Apex in the future .  
2	  Well , from the other reviews , i could see that some folks are trying to go to the dance floor with this thing but hey , this is a transmitter and secondly , if the transmitter is kept stationary , the receiver has no problems getting a good signal , if in your car it is jumping up and down , that could be the problem with the bad reception or just that your FM Radio is a junk box . Just becoz it uses a single AA battery , the range or amplitude of the signal might not be so strong but I got good reception from it . Update : Hiked to 2.4V , the signal is much better . i 'll certainly need a good antenna to transmit . currently got a big alu . foil sheet and the antenna making a good connection to it :-) totally caveman like but hey , it works !  
2	  The cable just snapped in and is working I do not know why you would pay any more . The cable itself is quite stiff and thin so I would be careful not to bend it too much or I guess it could break .  
2	  I 've had no problems with this cable . Do NOT overpay for HDMI cables , brands and high-priced models won't perform any better than cheaper cables . I 'd recommend these cables .  
2	  While this product cannot beat the sound quality of an auxiliary plug-in , it is in a close second leaving FM Transmitters in a distant third . Installed in 45 minutes . I highly recommend this product .  
1	  The picture and the product that you receive are not the same . The packaging states that it is " exclusively for Pentax Optio WP and Option WPi digital Cameras " . Cutouts and buttons do not line up .  
1	  I must have received a bad batch of disks . If you were to look at the sides on the spindle of disks there is a bunch of warping . As far as a being able to record on them only 1 out of every 5 so far have worked , then when I try to play back the disks they skip . Very unhappy with this product . I had to buy more disks as these have been utterly useless to me .  
1	  I purchased 2 of these sound stage docking stations , which are marketed specifically for use with the iPod . Neither one worked properly . The iPods did not play through the station 's speakers when docked - they had to be connected to the station with a cable for the music to play . Also , this docking station would not charge the iPods ( one of the primary product features ) . A message displayed on the iPod screens stating that the devices were not compatible . This product was a total waste of money .  
1	  I had to return this product because it was defective upon opening . There was something that rattled like a loose screw when turned . For an electrical product I dare not take the chance to plug it in .  
1	  I tried the T613-BNC for my my iPhone 4s and OTH headphones to see if it would help enhance the sound . It did make it louder but I noticed NO impovement to the quality . For others this may be the desired effect . The tests were made playing several 320 kpbs songs . In addition the device is fragile the patch cord is too short and produced static while using . Review the TOS as the seller promptly reminded me of their policy . YOU MUST PAY FOR return shipping and a re-stocking fee . BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK ! PS : I have downgraded this to 1 star after re-testing by a 3rd party .  
1	  No review or terrible review - because I am not sure how this sysytem of extended service plan works with this seller . Was this supposed to be an email document or something more solid that I am supposed to get in the mail ? I am unsure because I have not received anything in the mail so please clarify asap .  
2	  What 's to be said ; You 're getting the same original Canon product for 20 % - 30 % less , plus free shipping ( if you don't want it the next day )  
1	  Ordered 3 weeks before Christmas this year . Was told several times that the frames were backordered and would not ship out until the week before Christmas , but that they would be expeditied . Come the last shipping day before Christmas and they are still backordered . Customer service is of no help . How is it that a company can make one ( and only one ) product and still not be able to come close to making Christmas needs ? I mean , they could have locked me ( 3 frames ) in for life as a customer with their wildly overpriced $ 12 a month service . The first year was included with the frames we bought , but I have no doubt that we would have kept the service for ease of use . I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN SCREW IT UP THIS BAD !  
1	  This player has it all : FM radio , MP3 playback , a remote , and it 's joggable with a special hand strap . The earphones , by the way , are excellent ! What this device suffers from is poor sound quality , with meager means of customization . You have two options when it comes to sound processing : Bass boost on ( which makes the music sound blown out and distorted ) or bass boost off . Overall , music sounds unpronounced and muffled . I 've tried using the player with a few different sets of earphones , all with the same effect . This device towers over others , especially at price-point , on functionality . I mean , it does it all . But unfortunately , sound quality suffers on this device . If that 's not important to you , this might be a good player for you . If you want to hear high quality playback , this isn't for you . I really think that if JVC had included more options for equalization ( EQ ) , the sound playback issues wouldn't be so overshadowingly bad .  
1	  My Grado 60 is more than 17 years old . The Grado 60 has clearer high , more natural mid , deeper low and richer sound stage than this new Sennheisher 280 Pro I received today . The 280 does have better isolation due to enclosed design . That isolation also comes with a price , it get hot very fast while I can listen to the Grado 60 for over an hour without notice any heat or fatigue on my ears . I had my wife and son listen to both on various songs , with the volume lower on the Grado since that headphone is more sensitive than the 280 , we have no doubt the Grado 60 is much better sounding than the 280 after 3 minutes . The Grado 60 cost me 69.00 years ago and it is still selling at that price , cheaper than the 280 on special sale . If you want to buy this unit , you owe yourself a listen to the Grado 60 first .  
2	  This Display takes the best value for money award in my opinion . I 'm using it with DirecTV HD reciever . The picture is no different to my Sony 60 " Grand Wega monstor display that costs about more than 3 times . Actually , the picture is much brighter . I have lots of direct sunlight in my room from large windows . But , still able to see a very good picture . From an easthatics perspective , I liked the look of some of the other displays , but the picture quality and price is what made me go with this device . The product has more than exceeded my expectations . I 'm not yet using the built in HD tuner so can not comment on its quality . I did use the Olevia WM20D wall mount plate and it sits very flat against the wall . The DirecTV remote did not have the Olevia TV as one of its choices . But , any of the Yamaha model remote codes / programs seem to work .  
2	  No complaints at all . This one is exactly the same as the original lens cap that came with my camera .  
1	  Sound quality is good , and it 's fine for occasional use , but I need a headset that I can wear for hours at a time - this one is just too uncomfortable .  
2	  The Maxtor OneTouch external drive has saved my life ! I run a small business with 120 employees . We all save documents , contracts , pictures , and ' other files ' to a central 150 gig drive . A year ago the hard drive crashed . As a small business owner I had to spend $ 132,000 in overtime to recreate the data since it was all lost in the crash ( I was a dork for not backing up .. ! ) I purchased the Maxtor OneTouch from Amazon ! and use it to back up daily . Wouldn't you know it .. a month ago the server hard drive crashed again ( darn it ! ) BUTT this time I was able to restore ALL the data in one hour with ZERO overtime . This saved me and my company $ 132,000 . I can't say enough . Buy one today !  
1	  I have a 800MHz Pentium II . This computer is not the newest computer , but it is not an obsolete computer either . I bought 512 MB ( 2 256dimms ) of RAM and to my surprise , the computer only recognized half of it ! The problem is not the computer , in the PNY web site there 's a warning about using this " high density " memory with old ( 1999 and older ) motherboards . When I saw the following , I knew this has happened to a lot of people before me . From the PNY web site : 7 ) Why does my system only see 25 % or 50 % of the total memory installed ? AnswerOlder ( Pre 1999 ) systems may require an older memory module design that PNY and most other manufacturers no longer make . Some of these modules are still available , but they are not generally easy to find . The modules that we now manufacture use a high-density construction . These new modules will not work properly in your older system . If you have already purchased a module , and that module is not working in your system , return the module to the store where you purchased it within the time of the return policy . If you are running Windows 98 check " MSCONFIG " to make sure that your system is not limited to a set number of megabytes of memory . Go to " Start " , select " Run " , and then type in " MSCONFIG " . Press " Enter " , then go to the " Advanced " button at the bottom , and look to see if there is a check mark in the box that says , " Limit memory to " . This should be unchecked . If you make a change here , you must reboot before any changes will take effect .  
1	  I had the 2200 lest than 2 hours , and bang freeze up 's , than pexls , then nothing . Brought it back , i " m waiting for my next new one HA  
1	  I opened the box and saw those descriptions were missing from the Amazon product descriptions : From Tamron manual in the box - " For best results , use the Tamron tele-converter with telephoto lenses ranging from 50mm to 135mm . " When used on Digital SLR cameras : This teleconverter is not designed for digital use . We do not guarantee its performance when used on Digital SLR cameras . "  
2	  First of all , 5 stars for Amazon for their exceptional customer service . Bought this sub a couple weeks ago and received a defective subwoofer . It didn't work and within 5 minutes , the back control panel was too hot to touch ; immediately unplugged it . Contacted Amazon and they did all the paperwork to have it picked up at our house a couple days later and sent a new one right away . Long story short , I was actually able to get it a little cheaper and it was delivered within a week . Now about the subwoofer . I give it 5 stars also , as it is everything we expected it to be . It replaces a JBL 150 watt subwoofer which served us well , but was on the outs and we wanted to upgrade . The PSW505 boasts a possible 300 watts continuous . The reviews and Amazon 's pricing sold us . We watch more concerts on DVD than movies so we were more interested in it for music than for sound effects . The bass is pure , rich and DEEP ! Very clean . We are totally pleased with it . Now , we have to upgrade our center channel and front left and right speakers to do justice to the subwoofer ! ( Hope my wife didn't hear that ) Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good subwoofer at a very good price . One suggestion ; if you 're interested in purchasing , check the prices 2 and 3 or more times daily for a few weeks before you buy . The price on this one fluctuated $ 177 over 2 weeks . We waited and got it at the lowest price we 've seen anywhere .  
1	  This is the worst product you can buy because you will lose it soon after you put it in your key chain . The cap is made of cheap plastic that will break extremely easily . I lost mine 2 weeks after I bought it - What a bunch of cheap engineers , it 's as if they designed to be lost - sad thing I will never buy a memorex product - they should stick to CDs !  
2	  I just recently received this frame for my birthday , and it 's decent , works well , and has a nice variety of slideshow playback features . The menus are also easy to read and navagate overall as well . This is a basic 7 " 16:9 frame , nothing really fancy about it though . It is 480:234 output for the pictures , decent enough , somewhat grainy at times but average for most frames . I know you could potentially get better frame picture quality , but you will pay for it . Also , this frame does not feature MP3 / MPEG technology , so you can't set the slide show to music or play short videos like some other frames , again those features do cost more , and polaroid does make their XSA-0720 that has them . But , for displaying pictures , this works great in for my needs . Check it out .  
2	  First , I recv 'd the unit overnight , very fast , as I didn't expect it for a week . Thanks , Amazon ! The unit 's not too hard to hook up ( for a novice ) . Within 10 min , I was playing a video tape & had to go to the store to buy DVD 's . Works great . Good picture , sound , all round good buy !  
2	  Nothing much to right here . I bought this to hook up PC speakers to my HDMI TV because PC Speakers are hundreds of dollars cheaper then any media center crap they try to sell for for you HDMI TV . Works like a charm . hmm What a silly saying . What " charm " has ever been known to work ? Works great . there .  
2	  I agree with all the positive comments on this workhorse of a printer . I have been using it since 1999 and haven't been able to find a replacement printer since , that is as reliable , user-friendly , functional , full-featured and perfect as this printer . I 'm so upset that drivers for Windows 7 are not , nor are they apparently being considered for this printer . Shame ! I have been able to use it on my Win7 system using " HP Deskjet 930C / 932C / 935C " drivers as some help forums have suggested but it is a compromise that removes some cool PhotoSmart features like the ink cartridge level information and other useful things . Too bad - altho I still haven't given up . I hate all the new printers that are out lately that have these elaborate CD install process that includes all kinds of junkware and extras that need to be installed on every device before simple prints are attempted . It didn't used to be this way .  
2	  This reader gives me a real world sustained throughput of about 14 MB / sec with a 4GB 120x Transcend CF card . This is about as fast as this PC 's hard drive . My prior reader said it was USB 2.0 but only did 1 MB / sec . The Jobo reader also reads SD cards and a bunch of other formats . VERY fast , works perfectly , cheap , no problems .  
1	  Product came with a bad picture tube . It had purple clouds on it . The TV may have been damaged in shipment . We decided to return it because Toshiba would not provide at home service and the unit weighed 86 pounds . The service center was also 15 miles away . Amazon paid for a UPS pick up and the TV was tracked as returned but we have yet to get a refund . Amazon was than out of stock of this item or stopped carrying it and could not provide a replacement . Other partners in their system had it a higher price with very high shipping prices so we bought a different brand from Wal-Mart .  
1	  POOR Customer service . You will be waiting for hours to talk to a rep . Its not that great performance . The body is not that stable looks like it can beak any time . If you get any trouble with your laptop . don't think it will get fixed .  
2	  I Originally ordered this headset to replace the junky $ 15 ones that i always buy and then either they would break or i blow a speaker or something . Usually would happen about that magical year mark . * The headphones are heavy . After about an hours use i was longing for something a bit lighter and less pressure on my head . Also , the way the ear pieces are made they are very sealing and by that i mean it really feels like its sealing your ears off and for myself , i felt like the ear pieces were putting pressure on my ear drum and very quickly i was growing tired of that feeling . * The mic worked just fine ! No complaints there . I use these headphones for one purpose only - my digital piano . For that use they are great ! If you 're wanting to use this for gaming , i can't honestly recommend it . For the reasons i mentioned above , i really didn't enjoy using these for gaming at all . I also felt like when i was talking on skype or ventrilo , that i was hearing myself talking as if i had swimmers ear or a muffled sound in my ears . That was very annoying and distracting . The speakers have really nice bass on them and for music purposes or maybe just for listening to music or watching movies on a portable divice , they are wonderful . For gaming and using for talking , not so much . These are just one persons observations . Your mileage may very :)  
2	  This is very well designed . It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides . This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides . You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right . The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles , it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires . It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go . It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices .  
1	  Rich highs and deep lows sound great BUT NOT IF THE CABLES FALL OUT Of THE BUDS AFTER 3 WEEKS of routine use ! Ahh  
2	  These stylus ' are much better than the generic plastic one that comes with the Palm IIxe . These stylus ' are much more rugged , and reliable and are built to last . You should definately replace Mr. Default Stylus . The reason being that these new Metal stylus ' will improve your grafitti skills 10-fold ! Another convenient feature of this stylus is that the top unscrews to reveal a reset tip . ( Much better than hunting around for a paper clip to reset your device ) Pick up these stylus ' if you haven't already , they are really good ! Certainly worth replacing the plastic one considering the price . Plus you get 3 of them in case you ever lose one .  
1	  I would not put my camera on this tripod . It is very flimsily constructed , the center pole regularly comes disconnected , the handle for raising the top bar appears like it will fall off any day . I would not recommend this product . The only use I could have for this would be using this as a table tripod , and not risk damaging my camera or speedlite .  
1	  I bought this product knowing it will protect my lens but i discovered that it will damage it so I returned it . I have a wide angle tokina that i just purchased along with the said filter , when i placed it to the lens it touches the glass when zoomed at 24 mm . No ill feelings but just disapointed .  
1	  I purchased this camera New just prior to my wife and I getting married in December . It came with all the valid warrantees and receipts . Slowly , over the course of our honeymoon the it was harder to get the shutter release button to trigger a photo . Additionally the MENU button on the back would stay depressed for a while after a period of non-use . Regardless , we treated the new camera as if it was an eggshell , figuring that we would bring it back and have it repaired under warrantee . We turned it in for repair .. Nearly a month later we were finally contacted and told that the camera repair would cost over [ $ ] because it had internal damage ! It seems that a drop or similar shock ad resulted in mounting brackets inside breaking ( Strange , because there was nothing wrong with the LCD screen when we turned it in ) . Additionally , indicated other damage existed . Where did this other damage come from ? Based on my experience with this company , I will no longer buy product from them , and I suggestthat you do the same .  
2	  I have had a camera for over 20 years now . I love taking pictures and trying to get what I see to translate to the picture so I can share my vision with others . Since I got my first digital , I feel like I 've been fighting with the camera to do what I want , and it was getting harder and harder to get my vision across . And then I bought the S3 . It makes things so easy ! Just keeping it on Auto has made some terrific photos , which show what I wanted to show , without having to fight anything . It turns on and off instantly , unlike the camera I replaced with the S3 . It 's almost silent . The noise of taking a picture can be turned on and off , but I like the little noise , so I keep it on . You can also change the noise to something silly like a dog barking , which is amusing . I 've started to experiment with the other settings , but even if all I ever used was the Auto and my " eye " , I 'd be happy with this camera . I did consider the S5 because it has a couple more options , but when I tried them out in a store , the S5 was just a little bit bigger , deeper from front to back , and it didn't fit my relatively small hand as well . The S3 is a bit smaller , and fits perfectly .  
1	  Not sure who was the designer of this trackball , but it causes finger cramps and my discomfort in the button locations lead to more hand aches . Would not recommend this .  
2	  I bought these to replace a pair of vibe earphones I previously purchased a while ago at Costco . That pair 's wiring had pulled out of the plug but this new design resolves that problem . The sound is clear and vibrant , the wires are sturdy and the cable manager is very handy . It comes with black and white earbuds in different sizes and I use the white one for the left side and the black for the right . The fit is great .  
2	  I agree with other reviews in regard to shipping . Although none of the discs seem to be damaged , the spindle was broken in 4 different locations . Before opening the package i knew something would be broken . I will certainly think twice about future orders . As to the quality of the discs , awesome , not a single coaster .  
2	  I 've been looking for a small realiable bedisde alarm clock / radio / CD player . This one easy to operate in all three functions . Not only does it work properly and easily - it arrived on time , undamaged . I am very , very pleased ! Buy this one - don't hesitate !  
1	  I ordered the green earphones but got a dark pair . You would think you would get the color you ordered . I am not so happy about my order . I just wish I had gotten the correct color .  
1	  They mentioned in their product review : " Optically clear , non-reflective film ensures long-lasting , crystal clear screen images " I got tricked into thinking that they have an anti glare film . When i used it , it was a normal screen . Nothing " non reflective " and " optically clear " . Waste of money  
2	  This is an AWESOME Remote ! If your not tech savy then this is the remote for you ! Very easy to setup and configure , the only downfall is in order to setup the remote you must have an internet connection . Setup is as easy as 1,2,3 1 ) Write down the models of the equipment you want to control . 2 ) Plug in your remote via USB . 3 ) Go to the website and click a few buttons and follow the prompts and after about 20 minutes your done ! It is truly that easy . The battery life is great , and the screen is crystal clear and works perfectly ! If your looking for a high end remote with out the HIGH PRICE this is the remote for you !  
2	  Long chapters , long book , lots of unresolved threads - how brave , how brilliant of Knopf and Tartt to dare to offer this story . Tartt is among the best contemporary writers I have read . I can't believe I have missed The Secret History and can't wait to read it . I don't care what the story is - the woman doesn't simply write , she composes . The way she puts words together reaches deep inside of me - like listening to a Beethoven symphony . I too , am baffled by all of the negative reviews .  
1	  I ordered the AFW-4300 from Amazon , when installed the PCI Card it was not recognized by the computer . After several days trying to find out the problem I ordered another FireWire card by a different manufacturer . It worked fine . I then started trying to return what I consider a defective product . Amazon and Adaptec refused to accepted it , and advised that I get a RTM from the seller . The only problem is the condition in which they want the product returned . It must be in the original container complete with all of the appropriate stickers . When I tried to remove the PCI Card from the plastic container I had to cut it to pieces , therefore I cannot meet their standards for a return . I therefore will write it off to experience and be more careful where I buy in the future .  
1	  I bought this Tv on 3/7/07 for my sons 3rd birthday his whole room is done in the cars , now almost exactly one year to the date it has started turning off on its own , my son now doesn't want to sleep in his own room because he thinks someone is in there turning off his tv . He can't understand this is just a piece of junk tv . And after spending so much money on this room and tv and trips to Disney you would think they would stand behind there product .  
2	  The product purchased for me is considered value ofr money and thi sis due to recommendation made by Amazon .  
1	  I 've had my Presario for a year and a half now and I 'll provide you with my experiences .. Keyboard - I love the feel of a good crisp keyboard . I type fast and like to know that my finger has clicked on the key it aimed for . The keyboard is average . There are times that I will be typing in a word document and my cursor ends up in a totally different spot . That 's not good planning in my opinion . I don't know if it 's a glitch or poor typing , but I never have the problem on my desktop systems . Mouse Pad - It features a touch sensitive pad as is common with notebooks . This one is average . I 'm not impressed with ease of use nor accuracy and I end up plugging a cord mouse instead as the onboard one drove me nuts . I have big fingers and trying to be detailed with the sensitive tool didn't do much for me . You can set the sensitivity but it 's not very accurate . Mouse Buttons - work fine . No complaints . Weight - This laptop is on the more weightier side than many . At first , I liked that because it game me the illusion of being sturdier . However , I travel a lot and it ends up becoming a burden on my shoulder case , which is excellently padded . If you can afford lighter , do it ! Craftsmanship - I must say that I 'm disappointed with the two fold out legs in the back that elevates your laptop to allow underneath ventilation . The left side cracked after a few months . I now have to prop it up with something when using as Compaq wouldn't sell me the part to replace it with . That is bad business ! Battery - this is one place I don't have many complaints . It 's just above average battery time and I 've not had to replace mine at all . Onboard Software Bundle - Blech .. Compaq brands their name everywhere . Sure , it 's a marketing strategy that is not appreciated by me . Their tools are not fool proof and take up too much valuable space on the HD . In addition , I had to purchase the max extended RAM possible just to run at a fairly decent speed . The laptop is also partitioned into two separate virtual drives , which I do not appreciate . I had to go back and reformat that whole drive to do what I wanted to . I wish the software was non-proprietary ! I still have the laptop . I 'm considering selling it . However , after what I just wrote , who 'd want it ? It 's just below average all-around and I 'll not buy another Compaq anytime soon . Spend a few extra and get something nicer , you 'll be glad you did .  
2	  I work in a busy studio / warehouse .. no cubicles , just one big space with no walls between desks . These headphones work great .. never knew how productive I could be without all the sound / talk distractions . I know they aren't high end , but they work and are comfortable enough for me to wear for long periods of time . I wear glasses as I work , so the smaller cuffed pads don't press my frames against me head . I actually tried the in-store demo of a couple of the $ 150 to $ 200 Bose noise cancelling headphones . I don't know what the big deal is as I could hear the conversation on the next aisle as the music played . Comparable to those , it seems the same and even better to me for a fraction of the price . My best investment so far this year . The fact that they 're not foldable makes them less " clumsily " put on .  
1	  THIS ARMBAND BROKE IN 4 DAYS ! The armband is a really good design with a great neopreme pocket flap to help keep your Ipod dry but the huge problem with the carrier is the feaux leather / vinyl . From the moment I bought the carrier , I knew this would be a problem . The vinyl is extremely brittle and easily torn . I thought that if I was careful with the carrier it would last ( It was cheap enough for a few months of good use , which was fine for me ) .. I thought wrong . The design issue is that they used this terrible vinyl in the loop that holds the armband to itself . That is the point that gets the most stress during use ! The first time I tried to adjust it during a jog , it was history . I was not putting undo pressure , stress , or abusing it in anyway . Do not buy this carrier . Spend more and get something that will work .  
2	  Fantastic product . Does not get hot and performs great . Allows me to control speakers and volume independently for 4 pair of speakers . Sound quality is great .  
2	  This product was easy to install and configure . I replaced 3 @ Home IPs with one and save $ 14 month , in about 10 months the unit will pay for itself .  
2	  After trying several of the cheaper off-brand wireless remotes for my D7000 ( when the ML-L3 was out of stock nearly everywhere after I bought the camera ) , it was quickly obvious that you get what you paid for . None of the remotes had a range greater than maybe 5-7 feet MAX without having to press the button 10 times or so to get the camera to respond . THIS little guy , on the other hand , I can use quickly and easily at distances of at LEAST 15 feet away ( haven't tried more ) , and the camera has been extremely responsive at these distances . Either the transmitter on those other remotes is just terrible , or they are using a low output battery ; either way , BUY THIS REMOTE . This is indispensable for a tripod ( especially for taking family pics without having to leave yourself out of them . Sure , the timer will work , but good look getting a great pic with kids when you constantly have to go back and hit the shutter release . With this one , you can just fire off a bunch of shots and pick the best one , and you don't have to worry about being tethered to the camera by a cable ! Very small but easy to handle . Very light . Very essential .  
2	  The cables ( HDMI ) that I ordered were shipped and received in 3 days and were just what I needed .. Low price too .. No problems .  
2	  I wanted to have a set of good headphones . These were affordable and work really well . I just wish they were a little more stylish . For the price I paid , I can't have expected much .  
2	  It almost seems like there was a pricing mistake on this because I can't believe how good of a tripod I got for so little money . It 's a fine quality unit that even comes with a spare connector on the top to which you attach the camera . It works perfectly and has all kinds of adjustments on it so you can position the camera in whatever position you want very easily .  
2	  One of best price / performance solution .  
1	  My 880 finally beeped at me one too many times so it is permanently " fixed " in the grabage . This thing constantly beeps and flashes the screensaver , very very annoying , if it 's not set in the cradle just right which sometimes can take quite a bit of jiggling . At one point I had to put a weight on the remote and try to jiggle it just right so it would make contact with the charging base . Logitech could fix the beeping with a line or two of code in a firmware update and could add a few millimeters to the height of the contacts if they really cared about their customers . Also , the wording of the online software could be better too . Once you have it progrmmed close to the way you want it leave it alone . I went to make some fine tuning adjustements on a couple of buttons and the whole thing reset to the default . So , I had to start from scratch becasue the online backup was reset too . I got used to having all my buttons and their settings written on a peice of paper just in case . The actual functioning of the remote was great and I would have bought another one except for the annoying beeping . Now I 'm looking for another remote and would love to buy another Logitech except I don't want to have to deal with same issues I just tossed out . I don't see anything anywhere that points out that these are resolved in later models . Except the 2 contact 880 which I have not seen .  
1	  Don't buy this camera . And if you own one , like me , don't capture your precious family moments with this camera . The video quality is very bad , with red tones shifted towards the magenta . It is almost imposible to get good focus with the camera , even in manual focus mode . The motors that drive the tape are extremely noisy . All this noise is unfortunatelly captured forever in your recordings . Battery life is also very short . The built-in SD card for tapeless recordings is a hoax ; the pictures are worst than the ones captured from the cheapest camera phone , they also have the same problem with the red tones , captured as magentas . The video captured on the SD card , is low quality recording not acceptable for a video camera . Save a few more dollars and go with a better camera . You will get what you paid for with this camera .  
1	  I 've used the Finishing Touch for hair removal before and have always been pleased with it . But this time when I needed to buy a new one , I saw the Panasonic Pivoting Head Facial Groomer . The fact that it pivoted is what sold me . Boy was I wrong ! First of all , the Panasonic doesn't have the power that the Finishing Touch does and you can't press it hard when you need to . The big problem was that when I changed the blades the second time , the locking mechanism simply broke off . Although both devices are made with plastic , the Panasonic is made with a much cheaper grade of plastic , and that is why the locking mechanism broke-it was plainly too flimsy to last . I 'm happy that some others have had no problems with their Panasonics , but I won't chance it again .  
1	  I use SD cards with both my camera and have been looking for a card reader which could handle SD and SDHC cards . This one was priced right and had good reviews . Unfortunately it apparently doesn't work with MicroSD cards that use the PNY CE Adapter . I tried on two different Windows machines ( XP and Win7 ) . When I plug the card in I get a dialog box that asks if I want to format the card . The card is already formated and contains photos . Sandisk MicroMate Reader - for SD and SDHC memory cards  
1	  Two out of ten of these discs may have functioned correctly . The other eight had sporatic disc error 0x80070571 disc structure is corrupt orunreadable . Erase , diagnostic scans showed multible errors . Returned to Amazon for refund , only bright note was ease of discs return , wonderful process used by Amazon . Will try another brand .  
2	  I received this product in a timely fashion and it was extremely easy to install . I have had no problems with it , and it is not noisy as others have complained it is . It is actually very quiet , except for a tiny faint motor sound for a few seconds when you access files from it . I am only using it for simple storage of files , nothing fancy .  
1	  I used nothing but Sony DVD-R discs for nearly six years and had no problems with them until now . The latest stack that I bought is horribly unreliable . At least 40 % of them so far have been bad , not passing data verification or playing back video with glitches even if they do pass it . I tried two different software programs and even replaced my desktop PC 's DVD burner in case it was failing , but continued to have bad luck with them . My laptop 's DVD burner software sees these discs as 8X rather than 16X like they 're rated , and the odds of them working seems to increase at burn speeds below 8X . But I 'm definitely not getting what I paid for anymore , so I 'll be switching to a new brand .  
1	  Run far away from this useless product . Tried giving my PC an address in 192.168.1 . x , tried using three different ethernet cables ( inlcuding a crossover ) . Nothing . I could not ping the device , I could not connect to the web-based config util , and the setup util could never find it . Am I going to spend hours on the phone with a support tech who knows less about computer networks than I do ? No . I 'll take my money back , thank you .  
2	  I bought two of these cameras for my kids . They are easy to use and have a variety of use options ( timer , video , still shots ) . My one critique is they burn through batteries fairly fast , so use rechargeable AA 's instead of disposable !  
1	  The firewall is useless if you have more than one machine behind it . The port forwarding does not allow ranges of internal IP addresses , and if you specify more than one the the port stops working for ALL addresses . For example , want to open TCP / 123 for NTP synchronization ? Have more than one machine ? If you don't forward the port , you can't connect to the NTP server . If you forward one IP , it works , but if you forward both IP addresses , neither of them are able to connect to NTP . There appears to be no support for RTP / RTSP streaming ( e.g. , QuickTime ) , though there is a mysterious ( and essentially undocumented ) " port triggering " feature . Absolutely no idea how this is supposed to work ; the docs are nearly useless and there is nothing on the Linksys web site . In spite of the claims in the data sheet , it could not connect to the common IPSec VPN my company uses . It does not offer the option of logging firewall violations , so troubleshooting is very difficult . I 'm using the latest firmware 1.40.2 .  
2	  I have had many pocket radios , this is the best . Wish it had a better arrangement for winding the antenna .  
1	  I bought this lens after lengthy deliberation . I decided to go with the 2.8 lens instead of the f4 because I shoot lots of concerts in low light . I needed a lens that could give me the flexibility of a large aperture and the zoom of 70-200 . Unfortunately after only 30 days or so this lens starting causing me problems . The AF would not work consistently - the motor would run and run and not focus correctly . I sent it back to Canon and they repaired it . The service details on the repair was the following : replaced 3rd lens assembly , focusing assembly , and other parts . Checked all adjusted center / tilt / focus cleaned all factory spec . Regardless of the this seeminglt thorough repair I received the lens today and went out to shoot . To my great disappointment I began to receive errors included a Err 01 and 00 on the aperture settings . This freezes my camera and I am not able to shoot . The only remedy is to take out my camera battery out , put it back in , and then shoot 3 shots after which I receive the error again and repeat the process . I checked my other lens and they work fine with my 20D . I called Canon of course not happy and asking for a replacement instead of a repair . The technicion Bruce who was trying to be as helpful as possible told me to clean the sensor with a penical eraser . I tried that and it did not work . The best they could do was offer another repair and a mailing label . I am not happy with this lens or with Canon 's policy and have heard of other defective units . I think Canon should just replace the thing instead of working on the defective unit . I shoot professionally - I have a show to shoot tonight and will not be able to use this lens . This is a missed opportunity . I am also scheduled to shoot Modest Mouse on March 8 and the way things are looking I will not have this lens for that event either . I have been a Canon customer since I first started taking photos but this whole experience has made me doubt their committment to their customers . If you are a professional who counts on good reliable craftmenship I might reconsider buying this lens . I have heard that defects are fairly common with this lens . When it works like it is supposed to it takes gorgeous photos . The glass is top notch . But of course if it doesn't work than none of that matters .  
2	  I like the little camera from Swann . It gives a nice video picture . I plan to use it with my Earth-Moon-Earth dish to communicate with other amateur radio opearators via signals off the moon . The camera will sit in the middle of the dish to help me point at the moon . I will also be using it to measure sun noise so have rigged up some welders glass infront of the camera to look at the sun .  
1	  Bought this for Christmas for my daughter , what a waste . After putting in new batteries a few times it was useless didn't work . Giving the benefit of the doubt sent back for replacement , to which received promptly but unfortunately just sent the replacement back for a refund this time , not wasting my time on this model . Buyer beware on this portable cd player .  
1	  The unit is supposed to be recondtioned and as per the rep have a new drum . The one I got had a used drum with scratches that showed up on every copy . Called for exchange . Will see how it works . But may I say that I am very disappointed with the Amazon retrun procedures . Any items shipped should come with a return lable . I had to log in find the item , call the supplier etc . too complicated and time consumeing .  
1	  I have the receiver right by the mouse ( literally 3 inches away ) and I get a weak signal message . When I type some of the text I type does not go through . I have to reread everything I do . I have it nhear my laptop with wifi off but bluetooth on . I hate this thing ! Extremely annoying product !  
2	  i needed another HDMI cord so that i didnt have to keep switching the one i already had between my xbox and ps3 , so i bought this . it works perfectly , i would reccomend this to anyone looking for an HDMI cable .  
1	  Before you read this you should know that after my review is posted , someone from Panasonic will post at least two reviews to refute what I say . That being said . . . I bought this camera almost exactly two years ago and was very pleased with the quality of the pictures and the ease of use . Then , one day it just died on me . I went on the Panasonic website and filled out a repair order , gave them my credit card info for the diagnostic charge and mailed it to their repair center . Ten days later I called to get a status on the repair and was told they had not even looked at it yet because I had not paid the diagnostic charge . I gave the representative the info on the confirming email I have received and she said she 'd take care of it and I would be contacted within the week with a status report . A week later when I called again , I was told , again , that I had not paid the diagnostic charge therefore no one had looked at the camera . There was no record of my conversation from the week before and , unfortunately , I had not gotten the name of the representative to which I had spoken . I then gave them my credit card number , again , and was told I 'd be contacted within the week with a status . After another week , I called back to be told that the repair center was backed up and they had not had an opportunity to look at the camera . I asked to speak to a supervisor and was assured by Joe Martinez that he would have an answer for me by the end of the day and would call me back in person . He not only didn't call me back but when I called him two days later he still didn't have an answer . Finally , after over a month of back and forth , I was told that the entire lens needs to be replaced at a cost of $ 382.08 . Now , I realize that the camera is only warranted for one year but it seems that the lens on a $ 600 camera should not need to be entirely replaced after only two years . Therefore , I tell you not to buy this camera . Not only is it unreliable but dealing with Panasonic is an exercise in frustration .  
2	  Well , guess this is long overdue . I actually purchased this router bout a month after it came out and still to this day this thing is a CHAMPION . I 've used it with my xbox , xbox 360 , laptops , setup a wireless network to stream music to psp 's while on deployment in our shop ( US Navy ) , and just about every other thing you can want to do with a router . In other words for what it is , I maxed the heck outta putting it to use and its still trucking along . Come on people for it 's size don't expect to get some crazy range on it , but for its size the range is really good . This is one product that I can say will be well worth the money if you are in need of something like this .  
2	  This film is not for use in 35mm cameras . It can only be used for 24mm cameras . The product description did not give you this important information . You have to watch who the seller is . Never buy a product from the seller who has a very strict return policy . For instance , Photoworld will not allow you to return this product if you bought it by mistake ( if you read their return policy , almost nothing can be returned ) . Always buy things from Amazon or a reputable seller who has a decent return policy . Also , if you see that Amazon is the seller in the product list view , the seller may be switched to a different seller when you enter into the product page . You 'll need double check the seller when you place the order .  
1	  Theoretically , an HDMI cable is an HDMI cable . I ordered this one because it 's cheap and had good feedback , but unfortunately my experience was anything but positive . The cable doesn't work . I plugged in my ps3 - at first , random bits of noise / white lines would show up on the screen . In the span of one day of use , the cable started to short out - I would lose the connection . Then it stopped working altogether - still in the same day . Simply put , a piece of junk that doesn't work .

Contra :* It feels very flimsy . I 'm afraid it would break in no time . * It is VERY HARD to make it do precisely what you want . For example , when you try to pan , you will eventually fall into tilting , even though you didn't mean to . Tilting similarly tends to turn into zooming , and so on . * The springs are too tight . After just about 10 minutes , my muscles are aching . * The device isn't supported " natively " . As you know , you can plug in any mouse , joystick , keyboard , etc . , and Windows will recognize the device and make use of it immediately . Not with this one , it requires software download ( the CD has obsolete version ) * That software download size is ENORMOUS ! 100 + Mb ! Come on guys , the whole 3D Studio package took less than that a couple years ago , but 100MB for a freaking DRIVER ? You oughtta be kidding . So all in all , you better buy a 6-axis joystick .  
1	  I wish I could have given negative grade for this product and Philips customer support . I received the device 10 days ago , and that is how long I 've gone through pain dealing with it . The VHS part . I played a perfectly good VHS on this device , and after it ran , displayed picture on the TV for 10 minutes , the picture froze and stayed still forever . Forwarding it did not help . I still could hear the audio , but the video is a still screen . I tried with different tapes , to no avail . The DVD player is a lemon , too . I played a good DVD disc , which I verified with a SONY player , and it stopped working every 10 minutes and automatically shut down . I contacted Philips customer care , and got treated like an idiot . They want me to pay for shipping to a repair center for the brand new device that does not work right in the first place . So go with any other brands , but not Philips for this type of product .  
2	  These are really nice for the price . I 've had the BOSE ones , and those are nice too , but these are ( were ) 1/3 the price when I bought them . The sound quality is comparable . They block out ALL noise . Practically like earplugs . My only gripe is that the wires aren't very long .  
2	  First glance at the unit made me think I would never learn how to set up the receiver correctly . Instead , I found the set up was very logical and intuitive . Less than 20 minutes I had the Digital Cable box , CD , DVD , VCR , turntable , and theater speaker system attached and working . Only negative I have , if you want to call it a negative , is that I had to attach the DVD through the satelite / TV component hook-up as it had an optical audio input . The DVD inputs had no optical input but did have a digital cable input . I opted for the optical and just told myself the sat / TV setting on the receiver was the DVD . Otherwise , this unit is well worth the price .  
2	  It 's the best transmitter i 've ever had .. clear and no distortion even though i live in metro new york which air waves are very crowded .. it has 2 modes .. the us and the international .. even though it doesn't say how to switch from us ( default factory settings ) to international .. search it in the net and it will teach you how to do it so you can use as low as 87.5 frequency . i never tried to tune in to this frequency because most of the time the frequency that i tune in is clear even though there 's active frequency next to what i am using . i think i 'll use the international mode when i go to asia to continue my college .. best pick ! definitely a good buy ! ..  
1	  Kodak 8324154 KLIC-8000 Li-Ion Rechargeable Digital Camera BatteryHorrible : The batterys do NOT hold a charge . After @ 2 weeks in the camera , they lost all the charge . The same type batterys that came with my camera hold their charge for many months .  
2	  These headphones are comfortable and sound very good for the price . They are also durable . I 've had my original pair for six years and the only problem I 've had is with the ear pads wearing out . I also own a $ 750 pair of Ultrasones for critical listening , but the Sony MDRs are my standard go-to for general day-to-day recording and editing .  
2	  it arrived with in 3 days and the price was unbeatible , great printer !  
1	  I bought this to connect my hdtv to my old stereo . Didn't work at all . After doing some research , I found that you can only go from digital to 3.5 stereo with a converter . Not sure why this product even exists .  
2	  Gread player . Had August release and updated the Firmware as described in the CYBERHOME Website . The player reads VCD , SVCD and DVD just fine . ( Using also CD-R and CD-RW disks ) Also MP3 are a pleasure , together with the JPG slideshow module , add the Integrated 5.1 DTS decoder , PAL / NTSC conversion .. GREAT Deal . .. However , I did not get it to play MiniDVD 's . Maybe a future firmware upgrade will solve this ? Clearly recommend itRomain  
2	  1 ) Very light , less ear fatigue than any other I 've used , even less than the lightest mobile phone bluetooth headsets . 2 ) Doesn't make your ear hot . 3 ) Extremely clear sound with volume wheel that can go both much quieter and much louder than desired . 4 ) Paperclip switchable hi and low Microphone gain settings . The high microphone gain setting can be used to boost your outgoing audio volume so people on the other end of the line can hear you well . The best setting hi / low depends on your phone . Overall this is an excellent headset !  
2	  I was searching for this in the local stores , and found it . I had tried it at someone houses and feel in love with it . The only difference was that through Amazon , it cost less then half , including the shipping and handling , then in the stores .  
2	  i had bought headphones form shures before and have always been happy with what i have got . the se210 are no exception , thay sound so good when i music and i have watched some movies with them and they better then my 150 $ logitech speakers . I can forget they r ever there because they r so comfortable . if u have the money for them then u should buy them because they r the best . it was worth the $ 10/10  
1	  Would give it a higher rating but crashes the Dell Latitude ( Win XP ) when you stop the device ( as recommended ) and remove the card ! Bought it to use the laptop for Software Defined Radio , where the higher bandwidth would be very useful and a stereo sound in is required ( most laptops have mono-in ) . If you don't try to stop or remove the card then everything works really well . Quite a bit of the software that comes with is pretty badly implemented - sucks up processor power . Hopefully the crash issue will be fixed .  
2	  it has radio , touch pad , voice recorder , 30GB , smaller than the microsoft zune and better scrren tan the ipod is the best of the best  
2	  If you want bluetooth and MP3s this is not your unit . However , If you are looking for a great GPS unit that will get you from point A to point B fast and efficiently then go with the TomTom ONE . The two advantages of this unit are its incredible maps and its portability . Using GPS while on foot makes going to unfamiliar places an anxiety free experience . Now that the ONE only costs $ 299 it is in a class of its own in terms of quality and price .  
2	  This was my first GPS and overall I am very happy with the Nuvi 360 . I do have two small complaints : 1 . The volume is not loud enough to here clearly over the engine and road noise . 2 . The screen is not bright enough in bright sunlight .  
1	  Have had this for about a year and a half . It worked well for the time it worked , then one day when needing to smoke a turkey in the winter-it died . the transmitter no longer transmits . No real reason for the death , it worked a few weeks ago .  
2	  I 'm one of those folks that always had the tiny cameras . I will never go back after this amazing camera . It has tons of features and buttons I 'll never use . But .. for the average person like me , four reasons ( 1 ) you can quickly move back and forth between shooting and viewing ( just push the shutter and , boom , you 're back in camera mode in a hurry ) , ( 2 ) easy delete as you view , ( 3 ) phenomenal zoom , and .. most of all to people like me .. ( 3 ) fast response-press the button and it takes a picture basically immediately . Thank you Canon !  
1	  This is a wonderful toy for adults . I kept driving the wrong way around town just to tick it off . Recalculating , recalculating ! I can't wait to go on a real trip where I have to use it and truly don't know where I am going . I would like the chance to have more voices to choose from . I also don't really like the remote control . I can't figure out how to get to the previous screen .  
1	  Just like some of the other reviewers have noted , I , too , have noticed drastic print quality changes after owning this printer for 6 months . It says it handles cardstock well , but the first time I put a thick piece in there , it scratched the drum and luckily I was able to get a new one from Brother . I hand-make stationery and invitations and initially this printer did great on vellum ( which I use a lot ) . Now , the text smudges when you run your finger across lightly , causing a big mess . It 's even smudging this week on plain paper ! I thought a laser printer shouldn't do that - it 's precisely why I bought one in the first place . I changed the toner after 3 months ( not nearly as long as I had hoped it would last ) because I got that grey streaking / background . And no matter how careful I am in opening and closing the doors , still , the toner leaks everywhere ( even if just a little bit - still a mess ) . Now I see how cheap it 's gotten in price - down to $ 160 in some places , so that must say something . You get what you pay for ! Now I 'm going out to find something new .  
1	  I have three of these enclosures . One still works . One failed after 12 months of use . Another failed after 2 months . They look great . But they break . At least mine did . I wont buy a MacAlly enclosure again . I will revise this rating if MacAlly responds favorably to my tech support inquiry .  
2	  this backpack is so amazing my son uses it for school . it fits all his class books notebook and it has a special place for your laptop to keep it steady this is the best 80 dollars i have spent on a backpack its very helpful and you can use it for like 2 to 3 years its wonderful .  
2	  This case is compact and to the point-no bells and whistles , just a solidly-constructed , slim case for the digital Elph series cameras . This model generally isn't overpriced like many other camera cases I 've seen . Well worth the $ 10 to protect your investment .  
2	  this screen came in a long box , ready to be opened and installed on the wall . It is easy to use and does exactly as the discription said it would . One thing I wasn't sure of when I ordered it . It comes with two screw holes in the frame itself so it can be mounted flush with the wall , or you can use a mounting bracket to mount it away from the wall . Either way , it works wonderful and gives a perfect place to show movies .  
1	  This has an USB incompatibility with NVIDIA nforce chipsets . These chipsets are found in most new motherboards today . I don't know who is at fault . I tried the workaround , and it did not work either . It will scan a few pages , and then get " hung up " . $U$  
2	  It was such a cheap price , and the reviews said it either worked or it didn't . I decided to take the chance , and it works like a charm . My Xbox360 game quality is noticeably better , and the cable was such a steal !  
2	  Well made , functions flawlessly . Price a bit steep , but not a lot of FW800 choices out there .  
1	  This product was received in relatively decent packaging . When I opened the package , the bulb / resistor was not included . The manual stated that the resistor was supplied , so I was very disappointed in the fact that parts were missing . I tried to install this piece in my 02 Volkswagen Passat GLS , but I had to buy some random 5 volt bulbs from O'reillys in order to charge the capacitor . It successfully charged on the third attempt , but it immediately let off all the energy . I tried to charge the capacitor several times after this , but it would not charge . After spending several hours on this small project , I gave up and the cap is now sitting in my basement . I do believe the cap would 've been worth it , but the missing part was very disappointing and it may have been the reason that it could not be used . I would recommend investing your money on a company that would get things right the first time , such as Rockford Fosgate . It may cost a little more , but the results are completely worth the extra cash .  
2	  a friend tipped me off to buy these cables instead of the expensive $ 60 ones at the store . they were easy and work great with my sony bravia . i have no complaints and have been using them for one month . i suggest investing in these before buying the other ones .  
2	  Remotes , Wii Controllers , MP3 portable speakers , Umbrella Lights , X360 controllers , Solar rechargeable patio lights , and many other uses . while some reviews are that these don't hold well in digital cameras , i have found that for all of my above listed these batteries perform very very well . I own about 20 + of them , and i have yet to have one that has gone bad over the past 4 years of using this brand . My only problem is the mass amount of devices that i have that use AA batteries , and that is the only reason i own so many . The small 4 battery charger is all i use , and has worked great for years !  
2	  Very good disks that are dependable and reliable . You definitely get your money 's worth for recordingwith such clarity that you will want to buy theseand no other kind of disk .  
2	  Ok I was going to write a long story about how I got here but who really cares . The bottom line is this unit completely rocks . I compared it to the Sony SXRDs and the JVC 1080P ILAs - both are 1080P displays but will not accept a 1080P signal . The picture is incredible - truely like an 8 megapixel photo in HD . Even Home Theater Mag rated its performace ( 96 ) higher than the Sony ( 94 ) , JVC ( 92 ) and all the DLP ( < 90 ) units in its 2/2006 HDTV face off . But remember its a monitor not a TV so you 'll need to either have a cable box , sat receiver , computer or external tuner . Actually this is one monitor which you can hook everything up to since it has 5 HD inputs . I 've only found one weakness - sometimes when switching between sources it sometimes looses sinc and goes pink - but its easily fixed by switching again to another source and back .  
2	  I have never written a review before on any product I have bought but these headphones deserve special attention . These are by far the nicest earphones I have ever owned . The sounds that these little speakers produce makes me wonder how can earphones get any better . Their noise cancelling properties are excellent and they fit in my ear like a dream . Only concerns I have with them are I don't see them lasting for a long amount of time . The chord from the earpieces are very thin and flimsy . Also I wouldn't suggest buying these unless whatever device you have has an equalizer but , as soon as you find that sweet spot you 'll never want to take them out of your ear . A 5 out of 5 is well deserved for these earphones .  
2	  I was sceptacle about the order after reading the review here on whether I would receive one with the ability to disable the rocker switch , I actually ordered 2 . The booklet states on page 11 how to disable this switch and the remote model number is URC-9960BJ4 . Using information found on the net I believe my models have the ability to disable this ' battery eating ' switch .  
2	  I ordered these headphones looking for something that I could workout with and could supply me with good sound for my music . I got both with this purchase . The only problem some might find is these are headphones with heavy bass , but I love that part of them the most .  
1	  After reading many reviews I purchased a Tom Tom One with the expectation that it would be an inexpensive base line portable GPS . I tried it out around town so that I could get familiar with it . Its logic will route you to numbered highways over surface streets and this may not only be confusing and perhaps dangerous , but it can increase the distance to be driven . While driving on names highways , it would direct me to dirt roads and even a farmer 's road between grape vines and tree fruit . In addition , the time on the unit would be off by the wierdest amount , ie not just even hours . In fact , the time was never correct , or even close . I am afraid that if I was on roads that I was not familliar with , I might have been placed in harms way it I had followed its directions . I returned the unit for a credit .  
2	  I have had the camera for a few weeks and generally agree with all of the reviews . I would add the following :( 1 ) Image quality - Best images taken were after changes to the settings : set " contrast " down to " -1 " and set " sharpness " up to " + 1 " . ( 2 ) Battery - Very impressed with the 15-min rechargeable Rayovac , excellent product . ( 3 ) Memory stick pro - I have seen some debate whether to buy Sony v . Sandisc , the latter being cheaper than the Sony brand . I bought the Sandisc 256 pro card and am extremely happy with it . Save your money and go for Sandisc . ( 4 ) LCD screen - Big is great but prone to scratches . I bought standard PDA protector and cut down to size .  
2	  The Canon Photo Backpack 200EG is definitely a plus for photographers . It has plenty of room for camera and several lenses , as well as room for other accessories such as spare batteries , memory chips lens filters etc . The pack is lightweight and is comfortable to wear on those extended photo hikes . The only down side is having to remove the pack to get at spare lenses or other accessories , but hey , it 's a backpack after all . I would definitely recommend this item for those photographers wanting to get out and shoot pictures without dragging a bulky camera bag along with them .  
1	  I bought this amp and I HATE it . This component left BLACK , NON-removable , stained FOOTPRINTS on my once beautiful component table . Endless hassles for menu options that don't make sense , outputs that output for some things and not others ( for instance : their " multi-out " will only output cd sound , and if you were to listen to a DVD the sound would cease for no apparent reason ) . 5 channel stereo should pass analog signal , but it doesn't . So I tried the " tape " outputs , and the FM radio comes out too now ( hooray ! ) but still no DVD sound passes through the analog out . There is no method to their madness . The " hall " effect is horrible , turn it on and then put your head in between the center speaker and right-front to hear this horrid zig-zag featureless chop they call " hall " mode . uggh , I hate this amp .  
2	  This is a great product . It works by not only transmitting your ipod ( or other source ) music over an unused frequency but also disconnects your car 's antenna from your radio at the same time . That way there 's even less chance for a stray signal to be picked up to compete with your music . The sound quality seems very good to me and my kids say they can't tell a difference between what they hear from their car 's speakers and what the music sounds like through the ipod earbuds . I have installed one of these in each of my two kid 's cars . The hardest part was finding out how to remove the trim and radio without breaking anything . Once the radio was pulled out for access to the antenna , installing the device was simple and straight forward . The only complaint I have is that the length of wire that connects the aux . jack and antenna kill switch to the modulator is too short . If your going to mount the jack right next to the radio it 's not a problem . On my son 's car that 's what I did because he has a little shelf right under his radio ( 89 Volvo 240 ) to set his ipod on . On my daughters 99 Chev Prizm however there is no place close to the radio to place the ipod . I mounted the jack and antenna kill switch on the console next to the e-brake . I barely had enough wire to reach . I was forced to hang the modulator down by the gas pedal and stuff it behind the front of the console moulding . If I had had a few more inches I could have zip tied it neatly behind the radio and just the wires would have been behind the moulding . I would have given this device 5 stars if enough wire had been provided , but that . 0001 cents worth of wire shortage was a real pain . As cheap as the wire is they should give a couple extra FEET so you can mount things correctly . Other than that issue however I am very pleased with how well it works .  
2	  It 's getting harder to find VHS tapes . Our local Walgreen 's used to carry them but don't anymore . This is a value pack and are perfect to replace old VHS tapes so they won't mess up your machine ( also getting harder to find ! ) .  
2	  Tripp Lite makes good products , and this is a quality item , too . I bought it to take on a trip to Italy since it had a good feature-to-weight ratio . However , it 's a big device and I decided it was overkill when it came time to pack my bags and I reviewed my charger requirements . I got aOutlets To Go Power Strip with USB - Blackthat worked perfectly coupled with some outlet converters to plug into the Italian receptacles .  
2	  Excellent value although you can now purchase a terabite ( sp ? ) for the same price . Do your shopping ! These are still excellent HD 's  
2	  Good cable if you have to have one this long . Dont buy longer than you need because the losses for wifi are high . Use a shorter cable if you can , but if you need the antenna that far from the transciever then this is not a bad cable .  
2	  I simply cannot believe how cheap these suckers are . I would easily throw down another 20 for another pair of these . I 've had them since September , and I 've yet to experience any problem with them . Volume is a little low , but I don't blast it anyways so its cool by me .  
2	  I researched good lens cleaning tools on Amazon before ordering this . I couldn't be happier , the brush is nice and the lens pen works very well . It even helped clean up an old lens I inherited . I 'm very happy with this product .  
1	  I picked up a couple Coby DP-151 1.5 " Digital Photo Keychains . I didn't expect much for the price but this item is unfit to be sold . Coby should be lucky if someone doesn't file a class action suit over this unusable item . The software doesn't recognize the device . I used both the Mac and Windows versions of the software with two different Coby keychains . Also , the version 1.02 software that ships with the device is different from the version 1.02 software provided on the Coby website . How many different versions of 1.02 software do they have ? Regardless , none of them work .  
1	  I bought this mp3 player as my first purchase and my first mistake . The sond is good and plays well , and doesn't malfunction BUT DON'T BE FOOLED ! It doesn't play any music downloaded from the internet ! I talked wiht one of the tech support guy at [ .. ] and they said the player " doesn't support that feature " to put it nicely . Amazon said nothing about this major defect , and it is a rip-off to buy ! DON'T BUY THIS JUNK !  
1	  I purchased this TV for $ 2400 + tax in November 2005 . In April 2007 it ceased to function . Fortunately I had the Best Buy ( should be called Worst Buy ) 4 year performance service plan ( for which I paid an additional $ 400 ) . It took a few days for the independent contractor that services the warranty to pick up the set , then it took 2 weeks for me to get it back . When I got it back it turned on just fine the first time . The second time I tried to turn it on it no longer worked . It 's back in the contractor 's shop now for who knows how long . Best Buy won't replace the TV until the FOURTH time it fails to work .. I will update this review ..  
2	  I too came over from the palm . I always liked the many palm apps , but in reality the more I look the more I find that are useless , but no one removed them from the sites . I wanted wireless to connect to net at home , maybe work . Since I recently got the nokia 3650 phone for free I didn't really need a phone , but needed the pda and some internet access . I have not tried to use it with the bluetooth on the nokia , but I am amazed at the out of the box wireless net . Just powered up and connected right away with no problems and I was so dreading getting things connected . I had gone with the ipaq that had BT but no wifi . I bought a card with it and it just didn't work , or I just could not get it up and running . The 5555 is worth it , no problems , it connected out of the box and it looks and feels great . Color amazing and it runs games like a pro . I 'm pleased .  
1	  I have been using a Cisco-Linksys WRT54G wireless router with fairly good success . It is in the basement of an 1800 SqFt house . The router is 7 yrs old and figured while upgrading a completed home theater system maybe it was time to upgrade the wireless router . D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router signal strength was no more than half the linksys signal . Also , connections were lost in rooms upstairs directly above the router . I re-installed the Linksys and not one connection has been dropped for over a month now . This DLink router was a waste of $ 80 . Maybe Ebay will help me recover half .  
2	  I got this for my Kindle Fire and it fits perfectly . There are many ways to adjust it so you can always find the perfect angle . And the price is unbeatable to make it perfect ! I highly recommend this product .  
2	  Great product use it every day to listen to my iphone in my truck would purchase again . great sound quality .  
2	  What can you say about this except for that it was super convenient and easy to do . I love Amazon and I wasn't sure about entering my credit card on my XBox ( too easy for my boys to " accidentally " buy games ) so I bought points here and then added them . You can add them on xboxlive . com or directly on the console ( I suggest the copy and paste into xboxlive . com since it 's a long number ! ) :) Happy Gaming ! Oh yeah , and there isn't a discount if you buy more at a time so you can just buy what you need ! :)  
1	  One would think , by looking at this printer , that it would be a pretty decent piece of equipment . Wrong . I was gifted with this printer by a family member who bought it on Amazon a few years ago . She didn't use it very much , so I figured by having " low miles " it would be a decent replacement for my other HP ( C3180 ) , which had just stopped working . Well , surprise , surprise - the same thing happened to this one . Worked really great for about two months , then today it wouldn't power up properly . Once I turned it on , the screen told me " Please turn off with the switch . Do not use a power strip . " Screen told me to press the " OK " button , which I did , which did absolutely nothing . It would turn off if I pushed and held the power button . But once turned back on , it would go through the same routine . The software is junk , too . Most of what came with the download were programs on how to order HP products . It is now in pieces , to be taken to the recycle tomorrow . After that I 'm going to buy a Brother and I will never , buy anything made by HP .  
2	  The Konica Minolta Maxxum 7D is a digital SLR ( DSLR ) which is built on Minolta 's Maxxum 7 body in terms of buttons , knobs , and layout . In terms of build quality , it is more like the Maxxum 9 professional 35mm film body . It has an APS-size CCD as its image sensor which crops an image by 1.5X in comparison with its 35mm film counterpart . The 7D has a large , high-resolution LCD , matched by only two other DSLRs , as of this writing : the Nikon D2H and D2X , both of which are twice the price of this camera . It has a maximum ISO of 3200 , matched by few other cameras . Even the Canon 1Ds has a maximum ISO of only 1250 and the Canon 1D Mark II of only 1600 . The 7D has a resolution of 6 mega pixels , which some might find disappointing , given the plethora of new digital cameras which have come out over the past year having a resolution of 8 mega pixels . The big news , of course , is the built-in image stabilization , introduced in the Minolta A-1 prosumer camera . While Canon users , and , more recently and to a lesser degree , Nikon users , have had to choose a lens here and a lens there on which to spend their hard earned cash if they wanted image stabilization , owners of the 7D will pay a fair price for it once and will then gain the benefits of it with every lens in their arsenal ; wide , long , macro , or special effect ( e.g. , soft focus ) . This is something that was impossible with film . It really is a brilliant idea . Although there are some caveats , this is an excellent digital SLR with great features , handling , and performance . Please read my full review on my website . $U$  
2	  I got so burned out on mindless digital photography , I sold my digital Fuji to an old man named Henry and bought myself this Holga and a huge batch of expired 120 and 35mm film . There aren't many cameras that can take such a beating and still survive . I have dropped this several times , my toddler daughter has gotten hold of it , and it still looks and performs as it did the day I bought it . Helpful hints : get yourself some tape , because the metal clips that hold the back of the camera on slide all the time . And you DON'T want to lose your precious images simply because you didn't secure the camera ! The camera will probably come with a 6x6 mask already inserted , and the 6x4.5 mask wrapped in plastic . I believe the older Holgas never had an actual 6x6 mask , only the 6x4.5 ( that meant you had to tape up the inside so the edges wouldn't scratch your film ) . The other great thing about this 6x6 mask is that it holds your AA batteries in so you don't have to tape them up . It does reduce the risk of light leaks , so if you are going for that , it might not happen in-camera ( but I got leaks while unloading the film , so there 's always a way ! ) . I suggest investing in the cable release that will allow you to comfortably do long exposures shots without holding your breath and praying . Of course , get yourself a tripod , because this model has a mount already - no need to mod it ! Also , tape up the little switch on the bottom , the one that enables the " Bulb " feature . I have had entire rolls ruined because I was shooting in the daytime and had inadvertently slid the button over to " B. " Most importantly - have fun with this camera . It takes a few rolls to really get to where you feel comfortable , so if your first roll or two makes you want to cry , we have ALL been there before .  
2	  After a month , I am very satisfied with the price and performance . I followed the reviewer 's directions to set the unit to International , and preset the radio and iTrip to 87.9 . I live in the suburb of a big city , and have only had fuzzy reception once , very briefly . I didn't bother to seek another station , because it passed so quickly . It has not been tested outside this metro area , and a month is way too soon to rate durability . So far , so good !  
1	  My daughter received this for x-mas . I returned due to the CD player not working . I returned it to Toys R Us and they didn't have another in stock . I then purchased it through Amazon . com and it arrived with a CD player that wouldn't work yet again . I 'm going to return it and not buy another .  
2	  These radios work well . You just have to take the advertised distance with a grain of salt . In real life conditions , the range is nothing close to 26 miles . It is more like a few miles .  
2	  It 's really a great camera with all the features required for the people like me . The price also too good .  
1	  I did not purchase this through Amazon , but through a local apple dealer . I added a western digital 5400 rpm ' green ' drive 1 TB to this case , and it has worked well for time machine for my Mac Pro laptop for something over a year . Last week it dropped off of finder . Invisible to disk utility . Power cycling the drive , rebooting the computer , changing the cable , nada , zip , zilch . I 've had previous experience with Lacie , and I suspected the power supply . Popped the drive out and into a OWC Newer Technology drive cradle , and the drive works perfectly . ( Ok , it could be the logic board . But somehow I 'm doubtful .. ) I 've started a return process with MacNally , but at the price of this device I don't expect much . Instead I will likely end up taking it back to the dealer I bought it from drop it on their service desk , and say that it 's a piece of crap . Listen up guys : Data is too important to put on crappy hardware . I expect the power supply for a device to last until hell freezes over , or until the drive 's bearings freeze . Or until the basic drive is requires 128 bit addressing . Do . It . Right . Here the other thing Macally : You now have a rep in my book for producing cheap crap . I won't buy your other stuff either . For those of you who have one of these but it gets too hot : Drill 3 rows of 1/4 " holes near the top and bottom of both sides . This may add enough ventilation that the drive doesn't cook itself .  
2	  It contains everything . Stylish and feels like a good quality . I only miss a European plug . Ok , I live in Europe , but anyone can travel to Europe .. Am I right ? The Zune table dock nice , but You cannot plug your device with any case on it . So first you have to remove the protecting case .. Sometimes it 's a bit uncomfortable !  
1	  Bought this from Office Max a year and a half ago . After my Windows ME crashed , I re-installed the softwarefor the printer . Now it is not recognized by my PC anymore . So , currently I have a glorified copier on my desk . I called the tech support several times , but since ayear has passed since I purchased this , they are not verysympathetic . I understand . I should have been suspiciouswhen Office Max had put this on sale .  
1	  I bought a Transcend 4 GB memory card and it is defective . You might consider buying your memory cards locally since it really doesn't pay to mail it back then have them mail you one again . UPDATE : Amazon stepped up and did the right thing . I really appreciate the service Amazon provided . From now on , if Amazon and another company have the same item , I will purchase from Amazon-even if it is little more expensive .  
2	  I am throughly happy with my interactive pyramat . I play games , listen to MP3 's , read , eat , talk on the phone using my interactive pyramat . It is an amazing break through in audio / gaming technolgy . It is like having a $ 2000 surround-sound system in my teeny studio apartment . What a price too ! A must have for the holidays !  
2	  I recently bought this cassette player and it is the best music player that i have ever bought in my whole life ! It is well worth every cent . The music just flows so crisp , and clear it 's like nothing you have ever heard ! And it 's so stylish , and the headphones are the best , the headphones fit to any sized head . This product is the best out there . Buy this product , you won't regret it !  
2	  This camera has great features and functionality , is a breeze to use in terms of learning it ( as my wife can attest to .. although it may take some time ) , and it 's so simple to transfer files / print to a canon printer . I purchased this with the Pixma ip4200 printer , and it was well worth it ! The only downside I 'd point out , which was a real bummer for my wife and I and is the reason I only gave 4 stars is that the flash is very slow to bounce back ( so-to-speak ) . I recently got her a new 7 . x MP Canon Powershot SD1000 , which is similarly a snap-and-go camera , and the flash is a bit quicker at rejuvenating . However for the money , this drawback is truly minor , unless you 're planning to really take tons of quick photos .. and even then , I believe with these cameras you can set 3 shots at a time ( although you should double check ) .  
1	  The Photosmart 8750 printer seems to be very well made with some nice features and is easy to setup . However my " test " photos were very disappointing . Using HP Premium Plus Glossy photo paper and the printer set to " best quality " a band would appear across the printout spoiling the print . The banding runs parallel to the print head path and starts around the last 1.25 " of the print . The band varies in width and intensity somewhat but and is typically . 125 " to . 50 " wide . I increased the print quality to the MAX DPI " Highest quality " and more banding appeared in the print . I then tried printing directly from the compact flash card using the same image and I still had visible banding . I then exchanged the printer for another 8750 a couple of days later with no luck . This time the banding was typically fainter but almost always present to some degree . When image printing from one of its card slots or even from the PC , the rhythm of the print head sudden slows pauses at one side of the page . It then moves to the other side and again pauses and this is repeated for about 9 times around the time the banding happens . The print head will again go back to its normal rhythm and finish printing the image . I removed each ink cartridge and printed the image to see if one of the cartridges was causing the problem . None of seemed to be as there was always banding visible . Also when printing a B & W image the band was present there too . At any rate the print quality would be excellent except for the banding that keeps appearing . I retuned the printer for a refund after speaking to the support technicians .  
1	  This product has a good sound , but poorly built . The I-pod dock failed within the first day . Company would not respond to several calls , service department hung up on me .  
1	  I bought this product primarily because I wanted a FAX / TAD that had a cordless phone . I needed to replace my Panasonic and the store that I went to did not have a Panasonic in stock . The only fax that also had a cordless phone feature was the Brother All-in-One so I decided to give it a try . It was the worst purchase I have made in a very long time . Having an extra printer / copier around was just a bonus to me and in fact it is the only part of the machine that is not a disappointment . The restrictions on how the TAD can be used make it complicated and ineffective . Callers who leave a message have limited time to do so and that cannot be adjusted . I have had numerous clients have their messages cut off and I think that they find it insulting . When monitoring calls I have to listen to the outgoing message each time . Also during monitoring : if the caller hangs up we have to listen to a dial tone blaring in the room for several minutes . It 's very distracting . If you are in the middle of a project and do not to stop to pick up the phone you will wish you had when you hear this racket . As an added annoyance : If the caller hangs up right away you have to hear the outgoing message on top of the dial tone ( both at the same time ) . It 's hard to imagine why Brother thought that was a good feature . The outgoing message is limited to 20 seconds for the message center to work properly . I have confirmed with customer service that there also must be a delay of 5 seconds before our outgoing message starts . I have had clients who when confronted the with the five seconds of silence when they first called have assumed that they misdialed and hung up before the message came on . It even happened to me the first time I called my number after installing the Brother MFC-845CW .. Picking up calls from a remote phone is cumbersome enough that we just do not do it . If you are used to calling your phone and typing in your three or four digit code you will not be pleased with this system . I finally gave up and spent a $ 114 on another answering machine thinking I could just use the Brother for faxing and copying . I was then told that I cannot bypass the TAD on the Brother but still receive faxes without a number of new restrictions : My new TAD needs to be set to pick up on two rings if the Brother is to work as a fax machine . I am not interested in trying to run to pick up each call within two rings in order to avoid having the answering machine pick up . There is one possible way to get around this : having distinctive ring for faxes . Unfortunately that is not available though my local phone company ( I am located in the Virgin Islands ) . I am not alone in hating this device . The two other people working in our small office also find it intolerable . Having purchased the Brother All-in-One , and an auxiliary answering device I am still without what I needed in the first place : a TAD / FAX with a cordless fax . As for the the great customer service : we did not find them exemplary . The three people we spoke to did speak English ( not as a first language but well enough that we were not frustrated ) but we did get conflicting information . I guess it is hard to be a great customer service representative for a really bad product . After a month of frustration I am going to discard it unless I can find someone to give it to that just wants a copier . I 'll get the Panasonic that I originally wanted . I hope I can save someone else from this product .  
1	  I wanted to use this as a USB charging station . It has enough power , but it only provides power to the output ports when it is connected to a PC , but I only have laptops and don't keep the laptop near where we charge everything . This flaw makes it suck , but aside from that it seems ok .  
2	  Got this bad boy about a month ago and I love the hell out of this thing . I 've got over a thousand songs and 37 videos / movies / tv shows . And I still have about a third of the momory full . I 'm sure IPOD are great but this one is supperior , download , sync and play . Only three or four of the movies won't play but once I convert the audio it 'll be all good . I absolutely recomend this player for anyone !  
1	  Careful .. the filter comes in various sizes . When I ordered , it evidently defaulted to 52mm - not a good thing since my camera has a 55mm lens . In effect I bought a paper weight which offers UV protection . Don't let the same thing happen to you .  
2	  You have probably read all the product specifications by the manufacturer and other publications regarding the performance and features of the Studio DV . Based on my experience , I can assure you that Studio DV performs as well if not better that all the claims in the product reviews . Installation was a snap with no problems . However , you may need to stop all other programs running in the background ( Norton anitivirus , monitor power-saver , etc . ) to provide maximum system resources to Studio DV . Before doing this , some of the icons on the screen appeared jumbled . This is explained in the troubleshooting portion of the manual . The video capture in " preview " quality works great - it simply shows what you need to know while you are editing . After capture of your scenes , you can select any scene and scroll through it by moving the scroll bar . Ditto for the transition effects and titles . You can add your own narration by using your computer 's microphone as the preview window plays the scenes . You can then come back and adjust the fade and volume levels of the narration track and the other two audio tracks . This is very powerful ( but simple ) editing features that I was very amazed to discover in Studio DVSound editing capabilities are amazing for a product at this price level ! You can see the " wave-form " representation of the audio so its much easier to sync a particular part of the audio to the video ( such as an audio " bang " sound effect to the video " explosion " ) . The titling software that is included is A + . Why would you need anything else ? I have used $ 1000 titling software and although I had some additional " whiz / bang " effects , who needs that all the time . The point is to make a great title , put it where you want it quickly and easily and be able to customize it to some reasonable level . Studio DV lets you do all of that . In summary , if you need to edit you Digital 8 or DV videos quickly , simply and with minimal learning curve and hassles go with Studio DV . I can see even pros using this on thier home movies ! You have everything you need to make great looking movies . Good Luck  
2	  I got the UE 5 Pro earphones and was extremely happy . But then Ultimate Ears came out with the Triple . fi 10 Pro and I thought , if the 5 Pro sounds this good , this 10 Pro must be something special . Well , the 10 Pro is more than special . These are the most amazing music reproduction pieces I have ever heard . I am more than impressed and more than pleased . All of my music sounds better . All of my sources seem like they are new . And the UE service is truly wonderful . A company that others may want to emulate . Thank you UE for a truly outstanding product that " is " everything you said it would be .  
2	  Thinking of this bag really nothing bad comes to mind . Build quality is excellent , it 's very comfortable to carry , good space and basically you can arrange space in many ways . Fits all my stuff neatly , I don't have much to carry and basically I 'm using about 15 % for camera equipment , I also carry my GPS and other personal stuff in the bag . I highly recommend this product . Got it for 32 bucks !  
2	  I appreciated the sellers quick response and shipping - my valued GPS was not working when I needed it most . The new power cord was what got it up and working again . A great cable and quick service - thanks !  
1	  I got this because it was cute and inexpensive . However , I agree with all of those who criticize the user interface ; it is so exceptionally bad that I never use it . For instance , right now , it is playing the first 5 seconds of every song and I can't figure out why . Yeah , sure , I could look it up , but you know what ? I don't care enough . I have other things to do in my life than wrestle with this little object . I recommend the Creative Muvo over this , without qualification .  
1	  Direct TV in their brilliance decided to bail out on TIVO and venture out on their own with an HD DVR . It was a bad move . Their DVR is as user-friendly as an upside-down lawnmower . Where TIVO would require two menus , this one requires three or four , and only after you learn the pathways because they don't really make any sense . It frequently locks up , requiring a complete re-set . The " prioritizer " allows you to select tv shows for future viewing , but if there are no upcoming shows , there 's no apparent way to delete the item off the list . It looks like something that TIVO might have thrown away two years before they ever put anything on the market . TIVO is light years ahead of this device . Having a DVR is better than not having one . This is Direct TV 's only option . But if there 's nothing that firmly ties you to Direct TV , you should really consider whether you want to go with them , since this device is as bad as it could be .  
2	  The EyeTV software is infinitely superior to WinTV . Setup is a breeze , and the DVR functionality works flawlessly . HD quality is amazing . The hardware is identical to theHauppauge WinTV-HVR-950 TV Tuner Stick / Personal Video Recorder , right down to the form-factor . The only difference is the paint job . What you are paying for here is the EyeTV software , and in my opinion it is well-worth it . If you already own EyeTV 's software , just purchase the Hauppauge and save $ 50 . Note : This device is Windows-compatible ( including support for Windows Media Center ) if you download the free drivers and WinTV interface from Hauppauge .. but why ?  
2	  I got this for my new Canon SD800 IS ( great camera btw ) . It 's as small as possible , not possible to get any smaller really without sacrificing protection & utility . It fits in my pants pocket which is really nice . It has a small pocket for a memory card or battery , I 'm not sure both would fit in there . This is the bag I use most of the time . I have a larger one for if we were going out for the entire day .  
1	  It is March 14 , 2007 and I ordered the Zune 30GB digital media player ( black ) on February 6 , 2007 . I 'm still waiting on it to arrive and for my account to be charged .  
1	  Certainly was easy to use and set up , but the bottom line is that this contraption did not enhance our am reception one bit . One of only a handful of items I have ever returned to Amazon . If you live in a rual area - save your $ this item will not help you !  
2	  I gave this software ( really the scanner is nothing without the software ) 5/5 rating last time based on the good results I got scanning photos . I should have waited until I scanned documents and used the Scan Pro ( more like amateur ) software a lot more . The software keeps crashing and the buttons on the front dont work anymore - even thought there is a daemon from HP that eats away 6 % of the CPU load all the time . A document scan does not work more than once , the next time it crashes . Reinstall does not help . The preferences for the software is crazy - and hidden in 2-3 different apps . There is no way to directly scan into PDF - you scan as TIFF in PReview and then use save as to PDF.I am returning this scanner next week - and am never going to buy a HP scanner again ! Stay away from this product . - I wrote earlier - The Software ( downloadable from HP . com ) installs and works wonderfiully . All the scanner features are supported from within the OS and there is a plug-in for Photoshop ( which can be used for GraphicConverter and other apps also ) . Just download it and try it ( its a big download though > 100MB ) The software is stable and the 4070 scanner is FAST enough for my needs - a 4x6 photo scan at 300dpi took less than 10 seconds ; a 8x10 grayscale document took less than 5 seconds - after preview . The only feature I would have liked it for a scan-to-folder with automatic image file naming - this is available for the Canon Scanners ( CanoScan app ) . Dont believe all the misinformation - there is GOOD scanning software for the Mac and sometimes it works much better than the Windows one which by reading the Windows reviews here seems to be the case . Thanks HP !  
1	  This product is supposed to restore full functionality of steering wheel controls . How ever I noticed that it doesn't always work . Usually the next song button stops working or it magically changes into previous song for either of the buttons . The volume button always works that isn't an issue . The mode button also does crazy stuff where it sometimes turns the device on or off , other times it may just mute it while it is still on , other times it changes the function from USB to Radio etc .. Strange ! Not to pleased with this product when it isn't working ( 40 % of the time ) but happy when it is ( 60 % of the time )  
1	  I love my XM . And most of the time this little unit is a cheap and servicable way to get it going . However - I have serious reliability problems with it in my car whenever the temperature gets too hot or too cold . I live in the Boston area and from June through September every day after work the receiver ( which had sat in a hot car all day ) would refuse to come on after work .. 5 or 10 minutes later after the car temp came down with the AC or windows open all would be good again .. It has a similar but less severe problem on cold winter mornings .. it has to be down around 0 degrees or so , but again it wont operate correctly until the car gets up to a more reasonable temperature . I understand the difficulty of building cheap consumer electronics that work over wide temperature ranges , and I wouldn't expect my laptop for instance to respond gracefully to the same conditions - for instance . However , this is a CAR unit , and these conditions are perfectly expected for a car environment . I 'm sticking with XM , but I 'm pondering different receivers .  
2	  Like most people , I use this primarily to protect my lens , and it works well , with good light transmission . It seems to have a good quality coating on it .  
1	  This was my first experience with Amazon . com ; it is misfortunate that my experience was not good one . January of 2010 I bought from you a HP inkjet print cartridge # 15 black . Receiving the cartridge the expiration date was April of 2004 . I am returning the cartridge to you unopened . I want a complete refund including shipping cost .  
1	  If there are no terms and conditions to view before you purchace this " service plan " they can pretty much pick and choose when and who they will assist , if they do at all . I just bought a Canon Powershot S80 and called the phone # provided for information regarding this service plan and to put it nicely I will say that I was irritated just from talking with their Q & A ; person . I dont even want to imagine what they would have put me through if I was trying to have my camera fixed . When I was talking to their Q & A ; person , he who sounded annoyed with me at best . I asked some " What If ? " questions .. For instance , I said , " What If my camera got rained on ? " I phrased it that was intentionally . He retorted with " Well , it depends if it was " wear and tear " or " abuse " . The person then went on to say something to the effect of " I dont know who would be the person that would determine whether or not it was wear and tear , but I cant tell you . " Wow , thats a great help .. CLICKI would rather keep my 80 $ , it sounds like a loosely organized scam . If you are thinking about getting this " Parts and services " plan , just flush your 80 $ down the toilet , at least that way you get to see it spin around a few times . Thanks for reading , Matt  
1	  broke on the third day sent back to sony haven't seen it since would look for somthing other then sony  
2	  For me is a great product , my Ipod is always ready for play my music on my car . That is the article that I had been looking . I strongly recommended this .  
1	  I looked forward to using these headphones as an improvement over the buds you get with the ipod nano . But when I wear them the way that is dipicted on the photo in the carton they fit so snugly on my ears that they muffle the sound . When I turn them upside down they fit loosely enough for a beautiful pristene sound but they feel uncomfotable to the point where I 'm constantly thinking about them or trying to adjust them . Maybe the reason they fit so tightly on my ears muffling the sound is because I have a big head , I don't know . From the reviews I thought this was a sure purchase , but it wasn't . Oh well , another $ 50 down the drain . I 'll have to go back to the buds . Sorry .  
2	  Glad I found this item on the net . fits my Canon PowerShot A460 excellently and works perfectly . If only it could store power so I could take it along with me wherever I go .  
2	  Don't buy the hype OR the HDMI cables from the big box guys . This product is perfect and I think I paid forty cents . Buy these cables ! They are shipped in a plastic bag , so YOU save on shipping and YOU save on packaging . There is no clamshell , bubble nightmare that YOU have to try to infiltrate . Just buy this , save the frustration of fire-bombing your way into Wal-mart 's little bundle of shoplifting resistant hell .  
1	  This bag is well made and of good quality . However , it does not fit my needs . While I do have a Sony cybershot , it is not the small model that would fit inside this bag . This is the bag that was recommended , but it does not accommodate my model of camera . I have a Sony Cybershot , but it is a larger , professional style camera with a Carl Zeiss lens , wide angle , etc . This bag is simply too small for that .  
2	  The Nikon SB-400 is an excellent replacement for your DSLR built in flash unit . Set all your camera flash settings as usual for your flash situation attach the unit to your camera and use it to eliminate shades when shutting at day time . Since the unit is slightly higher that the camera built in unit , you will not create lens shade on your subject . I believe this is a better deal than the Sunpak RD-2000 . I believe the unit has some restrictions on the Nikon D40 , please read your manual before purchasing this unit .  
1	  We are having trouble getting it to download to computer . Not as easy as the instructions say . The first day she used it it froze several times . We had to replace the batteries , which was not a big deal . But it froze again and we had to take batteries out and reinsert them . When it is working she really enjoys it . We are unable to save any of the videos as it is not working with our new computer .  
1	  This paper , although stated as a good quality paper is not good for presentations . The fact that it is VERY think makes it very easy to be damaged . The slightest movement of the paper when placing it in the paper feed slot can easily dentthe photo . If you are looking to print stuff that you do not really care about so much thanthis paper is for you . If you are looking to print photographs that you may want to look goodthan DO NOT USE THIS PAPER . Use a 5 star rated paper . I have about 100 pages now of paper that Ido not want . The box states that this paper is thick , but it is not . And when comparing it to otherpapers the Premium papers are much better and more worth your money to buy .  
2	  I haven't written more than 3-5 reviews in my life . But this one will be one of the few . Here it goes .. I 've just got my lide-30 and installed it in 10 minutes . Works prefectly . Scan quality is overall very good , and multi & auto crop always works . Scanning is not slow at all as some reviewers mentioned . Buy this product , you won't regret ..  
2	  This is an exellent part for a non OEM radio installationEasy to install , and you leave the original wire complete  
2	  Tripod legs are fantastic ! 5 stars ! Sturdy , easy to set up on uneven surfaces . The foam padding is a nice " luxury " feature , so the hands are happy in cold weather . Legs also have " ankle locks " for low-angle position which work really well , and I appreciate the flexibility it extends . But the pan head just about average quality . Not very smooth . Quick release plates are ok , but you have to be very very careful and keep checking that equipment is screwed on tightly . When I do a lot of pan movements , it seems to get loose on my lens collar all the time ( does not happen with manfrotto RC2 's I use - I think it has a lot of do with surface padding of the plate itself rather than mount ) . There is no lever , which would not be a problem , only once head is locked , it seems to move off ever so slightly . So leveling with 8 + lbs of setup is not that easy if you have to tweak it by few millimeters all the time . So , the bottom line : great leg setup for the money . I think it would ravel most in this category . Do away with another head , and you 've got a perfect heavy duty light-weight tripod to beat up on your hikes . UPDATE 06/15/11 : After 3 years of pretty moderate use one of the leg locks quit working . I suppose it 's plastic and not meant to last , but for the price it was a still a good run for this tripod .  
1	  I purchased this printer just under 2 1/2 months ago . It did well and gavesharp copies . I went to use it today , and it will not power up . I usesurge protection on my computer and peripherals , and with no external powersupply , I am left with an oversized paperweight .  
2	  I would recommend a backup battery especially if you are travelling and this battery helps me to take approximately additional hundreds of picture with worry-free .  
2	  I 've had this table for over 6 months now and it 's one of my favorite prized possessions because it is so convenient and I 'm so glad I found it . I am way more than satisfied with this table , it looks very nice and I 've never had a problem with anything about it and I use the adjustments pretty regularly . I would definitely buy another one if it wasn't so expensive . It is one of the most convenient things I have ever owned , I use it to eat on over my bed and tilt the table top and put my book on it to study , if you study in bed a lot this is awesome for that . I managed to put it together by myself but if you have help around you 'll definitely want it , assembly on this is more of a 2 person job , but can be done by 1 with some frustration . I would never part with this wonderful table and have never found another wooden one like it anywhere else .  
1	  I purchased this item at the end of September and it stopped working mid-January - about 3.5 months . The return policy is expired . What is the warrenty period on this ?  
2	  These headphones sound awesome ! When I first bought them I was amazed by how much bump these things put out . They 're great headphones not much more to say . I give it 4 stars because the inside of the ear cup is hard . It 's made out of plastic and is covered with some mesh like black fabric which starts to hurt my ears after awhile . So if you have big ears then these definitely aren't the epitome of comfortableness . In conclusion , good product just a bit uncomfortable if you have big ears that protrude a bit .  
2	  I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH MY SAMSUNG CAMERA PURCHASE . ALSO , THE SERVICE FROM AMAZON WAS GREAT . I JUST HAD MY FIRST SET OF PICTURES DEVELOPED AND THEY CAME OUT EXCELLENT . I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA TO EVERYONE . JOAN  
2	  Works great ! " Very high quality " wired remote for the Creative Zen Vision M.I used some velcro for added durability ( along with the clip it comes with ) to fasten it to one of the straps on my h20 pack . Now I can just skip , pause , play , etc without having to even look at my zen . It can now stay safely tucked away in my pack . If you are looking for a high quality remote for your Creative Zen Vision Mfrom a trusted seller .. look no further , you found it !  
2	  I 've had my Sennheiser CX300-B ear buds for about a month now and I love them ! I 'm a musician and I was looking for something I could use for both leisure listening as well as simple audio work . The sound quality is great for the price . My one complaint is that the cord length is way too short .  
1	  I have had vey good luck with Iomega products in the past , but this unit does not work as advertised . Admittedly one can burn DVD 's from files already present on your HD , but the built-in video capture card does not work . I have tried it with two VCR 's and it simply won't capture the video out signal . It may be a software glitch , but I 'm not about to spend more $ on a separate viedo capture card and aditional software to make this burner work , If your primarily interested in transferring VCR tape to DVD , buy a stand alone unit - I did and and it works flawlessly .  
2	  Great sound , cheap price . Not the most durable , don't let little kids play with them . My 3 year old destroyed my last pair . But they sound amazing for the price . You 'll have to spend more for this sound quality in anything else . Same as the Radio Shack ones I love so much but cheaper .  
1	  I don't usually demand a fully resolved ending to a book . I don't need everything handed to me on a silver platter , literature-wise . This one , however , needed some resolution to justify how it was constructed . I 've heard this novel described as a coming-of-age slice of life , which would be fine , but " The Little Friend " isn't written like a slice of life . It 's written like a Southern gothic murder mystery , with much loving , beautifully-written detail afforded to subplots that we 're led to believe are essential , but ultimately go exactly nowhere . This book doesn't know what it wants to be . One star for the writing , which is great if a little too untrammeled , and one for the interesting characters . I wish I 'd passed it by , though .  
2	  It 's been a week and I forget the computer is even in the room it is so quiet . I came to change the four stars to a five star , but it won't let me . If I build another computer , and I will , then I am going to use this case . By the way , there is a locking cover over the front drive bays . This is great , if you have kids around . Updated Review .. Antec P190 , QX9650 , ASUS P5E3 Deluxe , EN8600 GTS Silent Graphics Card , WD SE16 HD 's , Corsair 1800 DDR3 . The system is awesome , quiet , and fast . Using the stock cooler with the QX9650 - CPU 14 Degrees , MB 35 Degrees . The RPM on the cooler in ASUS silent mode is 998 to 1010 . I can't hear a thing . Only complaint about the P190 is all of the power supply leads . I like the modular design , where I plug in the leads that I want . I just took all of the unused leads and placed them under the MB , where the P190 as about 3/8 inch crawl space . I have written three reviews , because I complained about no room for a cooler . But , now that Intel ships a decent cooler , I have no complaint . It seems like the Zalman 8700 would also work , but not sure if it would be better . I am going to return the Zalman . Zalman will tell you that it doesn't fit , but it does . BTW , the light in the case is almost worthless , but it looks cool if you point it to the fan on the side . Just adds more light to the system , so it is easy to see inside the case without removing the cover . Okay , so it 's not useless , but it could have been mounted a little better . Old Review .. " The Zalman 9700 is too tall . Maybe the 9500 will work . The 8700 does work , but not with the P5E3 Asus , which has DDR3 . I will try the 9500 , if I can find it locally , but if I can't , then I will probably use liquid cooling . It 's quieter , which is why i got the case , but seems risky if the thing develops any leaks . Plus , many liquid coolers don't work as well as Zalman 's , and believe it or not , many are too noisey , such as the Bigwater 760i . I also reckon that you must be careful not to get an air cooler that conflicts with the air currents in the case . "  
1	  I 'm giving one star for this product because it was doing very well until it 's LCD screan broke with only two years , and with not that much of a usage . I got very disappointed with this product because when I bought a Camera it was to use it for about five years . The LCD screan stopped working in a sudden while I was downloading videos to my computer . I tried to call the customer support and they told me the only thing they can do is to fix it with the cost of 175 dollars plus shipping . I guess I might as well buy another one from a different brand , because I won't be risking another disappontment .  
1	  The photo on the Target website shows a cable input / output for cable protection . The unit arrived with a phone line input / output-not much help for those expecting protection on their cable line !  
2	  I highly recommend this product ! It 's very easy to use and charges your iPod while whether or not you 're using it when driving . I previously tried a different FM Transmitter for my iPod , and it just did not compare . The sound quality is great , and the chance of static is slim to none . You can't go wrong with this ! :)  
2	  My first pair of RS 130 was bought from Costco to watch TV without disturbing my wife while she 's sleeping . I have used it for a couple years and it worked great . Sound quality , comfort , and distance coverage are excellent . Occasionally , I would wear it working in the garage or in the yards . We saw this item on sale at Amazon and quickly decided to get another one for use downstairs with the big TV . My wife wears it while cooking with the range hood fan running or when the kids are practicing their musical instruments . She loves it too !  
1	  Oh , my hopes were high for a VGA / USB switch between an old Mac and a new MacBook Pro . But alas , these hopes were dashed when it became clear that the Zonet relies on a " scroll lock " key - which simply doesn't exist on most Mac keyboards - for USB switching . All calls to Zonet tech support proved fruitless , though I did get someone on the phone within a couple minutes .  
2	  We had the previous version of the Garmin StreetPilot and loved that item , but this one is absolutely incredible . It is one of the best navigation systems that I have ever seen . The price was an amazement for what it is capable of doing . It is a million time better than the overpriced Magellan Navigation systems that all of my friends have . They paid a fortune for theirs and they don't do the job half as good as the Garmin StreetPilot c580 . After they see what mine can do , they say they wish they would have know about the Garmin . They also say , can I have yours when you upgrade ? WE LOVE , LOVE , LOVE THE GARMIN AND COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT AT ALL . Priscilla LeonaAlbert John  
1	  I am a little disappointed in the range these cover . I use it with a magnetic roof top antenna , and sometimes have problems talking on it just a couple of blocks away .  
1	  Note that I have used this on my Mac . I don't use the keyboard anymore because the keys require too much pressure ( or as one reviewer noted , it skips letters ) . It is incredibly frustrating to look at your work and see a dozen places where Word is telling me I have typos . When I first got this , I exchanged it for a new one because I thought the keyboard was defective . Not so . The keyboard requires the finesse of a gorilla . I really like the layout of the keyboard and the hot keys across the top . I especially like the keys for changing font between bold , italic , etc . One note : the volume control knob changes the system volume , not the volume of iTunes alone . I 'd prefer that the knob change only the volume of iTunes and not everything else . The mouse is wonderful . I use it with my left hand and it is very comfortable . I was using it on my bare desk but I purchased a $ 3 laser mouse pad and it really improved the tracking . Installation and set up were a breeze .  
2	  The new alley case is a good complement to my prized Macbook Pro . The protection it offers is very important to me . I like the different size pouches and tuck-aways , sure do wish they had more that take the small things like power cord and mouse into consideration , and made the cell phone pouch big enough for an iphone . Good case , will last a long time .  
2	  Not sure about the guy who got his " stuck " so bad he needed pliers to remove it ( joke ? ) But where I work we bought 12 of these . All but one are still in service . That one just stopped being reconised on any system . Sandisk Tech support was great and replaced it within a week .  
2	  This product was sent in a timely manner , the company proved to be one of the best , in my opinion , I have ever dealth with online . I am a native New Yorker , the company is from New York , ( Brooklyn ) I received terrific service from them . Leave it to the New Yorkers !  
2	  After much research I chose the card because the price was good and it is fully compatible with VISTA . I play Titan Quest and my onboard Nvidia would only play on the lowest game settings . With this card I can play at the highest settings and with no load on my CPU . This card was a breeze to install as VISTA has drivers built in . You will however want to load the latest drivers from Nvidia .  
1	  This product arrived scratche and the customer service would do nothing about a replacement . They have ignorged emails and phone calls and refuse to a ) take the product back for a refund , or b ) replace the product with a non-defective case . I would not recommend getting one of these cases and definately not through antonline . com  
2	  Big sound , small price . I use these as my workout headphones , my working in the yard headphones and my in house relaxing headphones . the sound is dynamic and smooth even at full volume . this is the same headhones a major electronic retailer sells for over $ 45.00under a different name .  
1	  Great clarity and well made , however I clicked the add both to cart without really checking it out . I am always out shooting at night and this filter does nothing to reduce lens flare , it may even amplify it . Sending it back .

2	  Does what it says it will do . I really can't measure if I had any improved performance by installing the extra memory . I just got my imac and it seem very fast out of the box , but because I want to install CS3 later and thought by having 2 gigs will help boost the performance somewhat .  
2	  This is an excellent mock home theater system . It is better used for a single room ie . a bedroom for optimal sound . The DVD functionality solidifies the deal that is truly being offered by JVC . My only complaint is that JVC classifies this system as a micro system .. there is nothing micro about this system , atleast the speakers .  
2	  I kept blowing the amp in my Infinity sub so decided to replace it instead of having it repaired again . The Polk sub has a larger amp and produces much more deeper , tighter bass than my Infinity or my Advent subs combined . I am a new Polk fan and am thrilled with the quality of product for the price paid . You just can't go wrong with this level of quality . Using this with my Polk tower speakers makes a complete soundstage for movies that I just didn't have with the old system . I am thrilled with Polk quality and the ease of purchasing from aAmazon .  
2	  These headphones were the best option , for what I wanted . Good sound quality , wireless , AND ( of coarse ) great price > compared to others . We need to produce ' better ' , more socially / environmentally conscious products , but that is something that we will have to work on . In the mean time , let 's shop as smart as possible .. Thank you for your time .  
1	  We have had the JVC GR-D30 Mini DV Camcorder for a little over a year . It could never be used during humid days outside and not very good for recording a baseball game , and basketball games inside a gym . Not only that , after a little over a year it 's broke and will cost $ 180 to fix and had to pay $ 30 to find out what is wrong and estimate to fix . The CCD IC Lens Assembly is screwed up . We now are just going to buy a new Camcorder . Definitely steer clear of this brand and model .  
2	  Bought this for trip to Europe . very user friendly easy to manipulate even without the directions in hand . great picture quality would recommend this camera to the novice especially . good quality for the price .  
2	  I bought this about 6 months ago . So far so good . It has worked on every computer I have plugged it into and has not failed me yet . It is small and easy to misplace . I have lost it 3 times in my house . If it had a built in password protection I would have given it 5 stars .  
1	  I ordered and received this receiver / amp in July 2012 . When I first connected my speakers to it all the modes made it sound like my speakers were bad , lots of hiss , crackle and pop . Well my speakers are over 30 years old , so I thought they maybe the cause of the problem . I finally purchased new speakers the middle of September 2012 and connected them to the unit .. same exact noise and problem I experienced with my old speakers . I tried to contact the seller ( The Nerds ) through Amazon ( Contact the Seller ) but have not received a response from them at all . I recommend that no one purchase anything from this company as they are NOT buyer friendly . I don't want my money back , just a replacement unit or this one fixed . But they have to quit ignoring my request and answer my email to them first . Sherwood RX-4109 105 Watt Stereo Receiver ( Black )  
2	  Have not had it long enough to judge dependability , but works great for what I needed it for . Slapped an old laptop hard drive in it , now I have an external portable drive . I don't like the cable that comes with it , but hey , it 's cheap and it works great .  
2	  There are different brands and different qualities of filters out there , and I 've found that Tiffen is a name I can count on . I use this as a permanent protection on the front of my lens , as well as it 's stated purpose - UV protection of course . I don't know what else I can say beyond that - it 's an excellent filter , has excellent quality , and does a great job of what it 's designed to do .  
1	  I purchased a SD2700 and two SD2710 's based upon Amazon 's 5 star recommendation . Long reseach was done to get the best quality since the SD2710 's were a gift to my children . Needless to say , within 6 to 8 months the SD2710 failed . No aidio output . I struggled with Toshiba to get the item repaired . The standard phrase was " it is out of warranty . " Finally , Toshiba relented and the item was repaired . Lo and behold , I shortly thereafter experienced the same problem . Same story from Toshiba . I am now attempting to get it fixed ( only two Toshiba repairshops in SC ) under the extended credit card warranty ( 1 year beyond the original ) . It is hard for me to understand 2 out of 3 bad sets ( I have not heard from my other Son ) unless it was either a " lemon lot " ( no QC ) or they are dumping questionable product on Amazon . com . My advice : take the laudatory reviews with a " grain of salt " and stay away from Toshiba products unless you want much grief .  
1	  When you recieve your order check the bottom of the battery to see the tiny sticker that says " refurbished " - nothing in the item description says anything about the item being refurbished - I feel deceived  
2	  I felt compelled to write a review of the Orbit Optical after reading some of the negative comments . It has been an excellent product . Very dependable for many years . As for the ball " jumping " out it hasn't happened to me in all the years I 've had this one and I have never noticed a " dead spot " during use . Regarding " no scrolling " complaints , the Kensington Mouseworks software , when installed , does have a scroll feature that is activated by " chording " the left and right buttons . I got the Orbit Optical as a warranty replacement from Kensington for an older mechanical model that wore out . Great warranty support . I do a lot of CAD and graphics work and my hand is comfortable all the time . No chasing the mouse around the desktop . I do admit I use a Fellowes mouse pad with a built in wrist rest for more comfort and it keeps the Orbit from sliding around . My wife liked mine so much she ordered one for her Mac ( now she has two buttons that work ! ) .  
2	  We are using this scanner in a busy college library and we are extremely pleased with both performance and design . It 's fast , easy , and relatively inexpensive . I highly recommend this scanner for any small office environment .  
2	  FWIW , I 'm posting this review about a year or so after I bought it . I figured people would want to know how reliable it is . Well .. its great . Its been in use constantly and is hot swapped between a hard drive and audio interface and it has worked fine . Not a single problem .  
1	  You 'll print great documents and photos , but don't count on Epson printers to last long . The Stylus CX4600 was my third Epson printer and it lasted only 6 months . The reoccurring problem with Epson printers are the heads clogging . If you do decide to purchase this printer buy the insurance , but better yet buy a different printer .  
2	  The Samsung 42 " DLP HDTV has an excellent picture both in HD and regular digital cable . I am very pleased with the purchase and recommend it highly .  
1	  Consider yourself lucky if this printer stops working in time to return it and buy another brand ! More problems than I care to get into .. Instead buy the HP Photosmart C5180 , alittle more expensive but worth every penny .  
1	  I 've used Macally products for a long time and have never had a problem with them , until I got this keyboard . I 'm not sure what happened but suddenly it just stopped working . The number pad went first , then the caps key and finally certain keys were unusable . Okay , fine , once in a while you get a lemon . The problem is , I got another one exactly like it and the same exact thing happened . It worked for a few days and then the keys started acting up . I tried both keyboards on two other computers - they still didn't work . It 's possible that I just happened to get the only two keyboards from Macally that were lemons . Or it 's possible that this particular model has a flaw that will sometimes make it stop working . At any rate , I was very disappointed . Just be very cautious with this keyboard . It 's a good keyboard , but after being burned twice , I can't recommend it .  
2	  I use my case to carry both a cd player and a minidisk player . The compartments are perfect for both , and there 's plenty of room for all your cd 's , minidisks , headphones , cellphone , whatever . The workmanship is excellent , what you would expect from caselogic . All seams are finished with no unfinished ends exposed . The faux leather looks and feels good , too . My only question is the carry strap . I would like to be able to remove the ministrap if I want to . But that is merely a question of vanity more than anything . If you buy one of these , you 'll wonder how you ever managed without it before !  
2	  The printer was extremely easy to set up . From out of the box to up and running took less than 5 minutes . Quality is nice , although the printer itself is rather large . Probably best to place under a desk rather than on it ..  
1	  I have it since almost a year now , and I use it all the time , but the neck band is kind of tricky weak , I am always in a fear that it might break . Right ear sounds lower than the left ear , should have been more durable . looks good as new but needs too much care  
1	  The pointer moves a way too fast . I could slow it down with the XP Control Panel but then this affects the touchpad pointer . Whatever I do , either the mouse is too fast , or the touchpad pointer is too slow . I installed the Logitch softare , and that did not help . Because of this , this mouse is useless on a laptop . I did not have any problems with older mice .  
2	  It 's a great flash drive . If inserting the drive causes an immediate blue screen of death ( BAD_POOL_HEADER ) on your computer , go to a different computer and run the U3 uninstaller program on the drive and / or from SanDisk 's website . Your drive will then work like a normal flash drive ( without the U3 software ) . Although this isn't a problem with the drive itself , removing U3 is the simplest way to deal with the issue .  
1	  My 10 year old son got the Zune for Christmas from Santa . I had nothing but problems from the get go . After 7 hours and three calls to Tech Support ( which were friendly and didn't keep me on hold much ) the device completely locked up and I was instructed to wait 3-5 business days to get the box to send it in for repair . Add 3-5 more for it to reach them , 10-15 for the repair to be completed , and then 3-5 for it to come back . Throw in a couple of weekends and it 's nearly a month until my son can use his defective product . I took it back to the store where we bought it and we got an I-pod instead . After 2 hours he was watching videos and we had installed most of his CDs . The software was horrible . There was no manual for use included , nor was there any documentation on line . Very few songs were in the Zune Marketplace - you had to go to outside sources and then try to download them into the Zune software . I couldn't even get it to work with Windows Media Player made by Microsoft . Tech Support was unable to get it to work either - whether that was a software problem or ultimately a problem with our device I do not know . As this was our first portable player ever , I wasn't sure what to expect . I thought I would be safe and happy with a product that had the Microsoft name on it . I could not have been any more disappointed .  
2	  This computer is targeted to the home user and small business user , not the power user . To the artistic type , yet not the artist . It has enough quirks and extras to make the targeted audience happy . I have been involved in the IT business for 15 years , and this is the first time , that quality and price combination have convinced me to start recommending a Mac ( iMac G5 ) to all home user clients . You will love the simplicity and style that OSX does things . Whether it is using the Internet , office apps , and the email apps . If you have been wondering about wanting to switch to Mac platform , NOW it 's the time . We have purchased 10 of these machines for our company . ( We run a hybrid network of Macs and Win machines ) . So far the results have been excellent . The users swear by them , and the desks look so much better . Everything seems so neatly organized , around the extra slim machine . We opened one up to add RAM , and to our surprise they are not hard to work on , hence the crowded space . In the long run , we have concerns about the machine overheating considering the compact design and lack of multiple fans to cool the powerful G5 processor . Also , I would not recommend this machine to graphics artists , needing extra real estate in terms of display , as this machine does not support extended display mode .  
2	  I had no problem finding information about this item , the price was excellent , it came quickly and works excellently  
2	  I did my research for about a month before deciding on this little bad boy . The A20 is is all that and more ! My wife who is a Techno-Phobic finds the A20 to be easy to use as well . To quote her , " Is that all I have to do ? " The picture quality is second to none . I was horrified by how quickly the Alkaline AA 's were drained by the camera . But a quick trip to [ the store ] for some NiMH AA 's put an end to that . Do youself a favor and buy two sets . The camera is relatively small and light , but durable ! The LCD is very nice in all lighting conditions . Also , buy the camera bag that was meant for A20 . I purchased mine at [ store ] for $ 9.99 . It is held securely by two velcro straps , so don't worry about it dropping out . The bag has a shoulder strap and a belt loop so it 's your choice how to carry it . The bag will also carry an extra set of batteries and two flash cards . The 8MB card that came with the camera was a bummer , but I purchased a 64MB the same day I purchased the camera and soon thereafter added a 128MB . I 've found that Medium Super-Fine mode will yield about 300 pics on a 128MB card . That 's ALOT of pictures .. I also love the Canon software that was provided . It is EASY to use . My Father who has a Kodak DC3400 , and swore by it , loves the A20 . .. this camera [ is compared ] to much higher priced and larger pixeled cameras . It is not a fair assessment . Take this camera for what it is : A great starter camera ! Yes there are better , but , for the price , quality and the Canon name , you cannot go wrong with this choice !  
2	  Frankly , with today 's gadgets , I run into the issue where I want to run my MP3 played to a computer , or into a car stereo player . This little cable really works for me ! My cable arrived in great condition , and was shipped with no issues . The cable itself has good insulation , and feels heavier than most light wires used for audio cables like this . What I really like is that it is the solid round cable , and it does not use that cheap , flimsy dual wire to connect the heads . The connectors are a nice and snug fit in all of my audio devices , and I get great sound quality from them . I really found this item to be really useful , and a great buy ! The price was awesome too !  
1	  I won't go into all the details but I have had this TV for about three years and during that time it has been inoperable for over four months . I have had the bulb replaced twice , the ballast replaced once and now the entire projection unit needs to be replaced . Thank goodness I paid for the extended warranty . Each time the set had to be serviced the parts have been back ordered and the TV has been set aside for four or more weeks until the parts arrive . I paid $ 2500 for this TV plus the cost of the extended warranty and I 'm just about ready to toss this thing for good .  
1	  I spend days with Intel customer support to get my new cam working on Win98 . I had to replace dlls and systems files ! I addition I had to install some more files manually . It worked ! and it was pretty good . Than I upgraded to win2k and also put the new drives provided .. The cam is in the dust now . I don't have the time and the nerves to spend another week with Intel on the phone and on top of it pay them for that once more . Try something else .  
2	  I got these not to long ago and at first I was not sure weather or not I liked them because they don't go as loud as some other In Ear Headphones I have tried . After listening to them for awhile I came to the conclusion It 's not how loud they will go but It 's the sound quality that counts . They are very Crisp , Clear , and precise in the sound that comes through them . Although with any good listening device such as a Apple IPod you will have to adjust your sound settings from time to time because different songs play different and you will need to set your Equalizer settings on your Apple IPod or MP3 player I prefer an Apple IPod because they sound a whole lot better than a MP3 player . Anyway to get a better sound for that particular song and to get the maximum sound quality out of your Monster Turbine In ear headphones you will need to play around with the adjustments on your Equalizer settings on your IPod or MP3 player . So good luck with your Monster Turbines and enjoy your music to all you music lovers out there .  
2	  I 've had one of these for years , but recently it has been sitting in my closet . The device worked well . Following all the instructions ( see below ) , it restored CDs and DVDs to useful condition that were badly scratched by a house full of small children . The only ones it could not repair were those with very deep scratches ( scratches still visible after multiple cycles through the machine ) . I can typically repair up to 10 CDs or DVDs using a single repair disk , but the later disks require multiple cycles . Just remember to be realistic in your expectations . All the disks I 've tried to repair were ones that were already damaged enough that they would either hang at points or not play at all . Since they already were heading toward the trash can , I found value in this device in that it let me save disks that otherwise would have been trashed . This was especially valuable when those disks were part of a multi-disk set ( TV series disks ) . There would always be one or two disks in any batch that would not repair , but by and far this has been one of the best money-saving purchases I 've made . I 've saved hundreds of dollars worth of software CDs , music CDs , and DVDs using this system and a couple of refill packs . The system works by using an abrasive pad to strip a thin layer of material off the surface of the disk . The actual disk data is acutally encoded on a metal layer ( CD ) or layers ( most DVDs ) that are below layers of plastics . Since optical disks read as the disk spins ( similar to an old LP ) , the radial scratch marks left by the DiskDr / DVDDr ( roughly perpendicular to the path of each ' track ' ) typically don't impact the readability of the disks because the uniformity of the markings does not bend the laser light . The final buffing stage proved key . Any residue or cloudiness on the surface of the disk will prevent the laser light from reading the disk . Buff , buff , and buff some more . You should be able to bring the surface to a reflective shine . Do note that you will still see the radial scuff marks , but they will be faint compared to the reflectiveness of the disk surface . Buffing the disks will likely take you more time than the process of running a stack of disks through the machine . My primary complaint about each of the DiskDr / DVDDr products ( I 've had both the manual and powered models ) is that I cannot get refill packs-especially of the abrasive disks-at any area retail stores . I can't even get them at Best Buy where they have had the units on sale . Yes , I can purchase them online , but I typically want to pick such supplies up when doing my regular household shopping . I 'm online now to order some of the supplies , but would prefer to be able to by the abrasive disks apart from the whole refill pack . If anyone has found a source for those disks , please let me know via a comment on this review .  
2	  I purchased this tv about a month ago , after researching it and last year 's model for over a year . I hesitated because I was waiting for more HD channels . I also waited for the price point of $ 800 , and then after reading more great reviews I decided to take the plunge . I 'm using it in my bedroom , which it is perfect for . The picture was the best I 've seen , bar none , but I was worried about the audio drop out problem , ( see below in discussion forum ) . However , Samsung seems to have corrected this with the latest firmware . My experience with Amazon and the ordering process was flawless . I ordered on a Monday , got an email 2 days later telling me Eagle would be contacting me for an appt . for delivery , they called on that Friday and delivered the next Monday . The guy came when expected , plugged it in , all looked good , and I spent the next few hours going through the remote and fine tuning things . i had bought an RCA OTA antenna ( $ 49 ) for local HD free channels , but it only picked up one channel , so I returned it and bought a Phillips antenna at Walmart for $ 24 , and it picks up all locals ! Just auto program the channels for OTA . I don't have HDMI cable or HD through Directv yet , but plan to when the HD dvr drops a little in price . In the meantime I checked my manufacture date , which was July 2007 , and the firmware in my tv was 1012 , the April update , so I contacted Samsung for the 1020 firmware , took 2 calls , but it was finally delivered , and easy to install . This way I 'll be ready for HDMI and HD dvr when I decide to order , with no audio drop out problems . Rest assured , this tv is great , the colors and true to life images with my OTA antenna are breathtaking ! Other channels through my Tivo look ok . It 's well worth the price and delivery , ( which I worried about ) , was flawless . I think my next purchase will be a 46 " Samsung for my den .  
2	  I have had other fm transmitters that sound like crap and don't come through clearly and luckily I didn't pay for any of them out of my own pocket . This one was clearly the best and I 've gotten these for friends and family ever since . A friend of mine is getting one for Xmas and i 'll be getting her one as well .  
1	  I bought one of these because I had a strange popping sound coming for my speakers every time somebody turned a light switch on or off in my house . I was told it was due to dirty power , so when I saw this thing I bought it right away . It doesn't do anything to solve my problem . The speakers are still popping , and when I measured the voltage through this device , it wasn't any more stable than without it . As far as I can tell , it did absolutely nothing . Its a pretty expensive power strip if the features don't work . I 'm returning it today . That being said , it seems to be relatively well built .  
1	  Save yourself the 15 extra dollars and buy the sennheiser hd 202 like i did after i was not happy with the quality of these sony headphones . they feel super cheap and flimsy and the sound quality is much lower than that of any 20 dollar set of headphones .  
1	  I would not recommend buying this printer . Mine is only 4000 copies old , has already gone through 3 toner cartridges , and emits a high-pitched earsplitting squeal when printing . Since it was still under warranty , I got Sharp to exchange it . Sharp customer service is fast and pleasant , but the problem remains unsolved . The replacement ( refurbished ) machine is even louder . I can't pinpoint the origin of the noise , except to say it is not the scanner unit . My guess is either the paper exit roller or the drum . The drum is not guaranteed , but should certainly last longer than 4000 copies . It also eats large quantities of toner while producing copies that are way too light . It is also considerably slower than the 12 sheets a minute it is rated .  
2	  This is the second one I 've purchased . I have had no problems with the first and expect the same for the second .  
2	  Fits perfectly on the EF-S 18-55mm f / 3.5-5.6 IS II kit Lens that comes with the T3i . same quality as other caps that come with lenses from Canon . No complaints .  
2	  Connected to all inputs and speaker systems without any problems . Seems to function well . Won't really know for 1-3 years if it is really satisfactory  
1	  I tried two of these radios . The first one didn't work from the start . Took it back to the store for exchange . The next one only lasted about a year . The alerts stopped working on it . I hope to find a brand that will work longer than a year .  
1	  Not sure what happened - worked great for 32 days . Now , no matter what I plug into it .. does not work . You get what you pay for I guess . $ 11 bucks to the trash can .  
2	  I use this with electronics to monitor heat on circuit boards and it works great at a fraction of the price of IR thermometers targeted for general purpose use . Always accurate to within about 2 degrees F or so when used properly .  
1	  I purchased this adapter to enable hook up of a scrolling sign . Cable does not recognize sign . After finding this out , I tried to remove software from my computer . It will not uninstall . Have tried everything to no avail .  
2	  The Griffin PowerDuo Charging Kit for Sansa Audio Player is very handy product . You can charge and listen in your car or any wall outlet . Have not had any problems so far .  
1	  This case is too Big for the W1 camera . The camera keeps on moving inside the case . I dunno why it is advertized for the W1 model ! I think if you have TWO ( or maybe 3 ) W1 cameras , this case will be a good choice ;) I guess this case was intended for ealier and bigger sony cameras . I gave this case 2/5 because it is actually a nice case ( for other sony models ) , it can fit all ur extra batteries & memory sticks and it is made of good materials .  
1	  My daughter sent me this camera as a gift for Christmas . The card said it was so I could keep in touch with my new grandson Noah . I was thrilled . It arrived the day before christmas and I ran out to get a memory card as the stores were closing Christmas eve . I ended up getting half of my pictures the next day-literally - a line of picture , a blank line , then a line of picture and then another blank line all down the picture . The problem , according to my computer savy son-in-law was that one of the heads wasn't recording and that was also the head with the sound . I sent the camera back to Amazon and received a new one . Good service from Amazon . I didn't get to use it again until February and I brought it to Florida where I learned some of the complicated menu selections . I came home pretty pleased with myself for having learned so much that I had some decent pictures from Disney . I took the camera to a Jimmy Fund ski race fundraiser and the camera jammed up . I could not get it out of video mode to camera mode so I could record . I tried everything . I called Sharp who told me to send it for repair to a company in the midwest . They 've had it since March and the parts are backordered until May so only God knows when the camera will be fixed and operable . I will NEVER by a Sharp product again . Very dissatisfied with this service . I am on my way to the Bahamas next week without my camera . I am not a happy photographer !  
2	  ESTA FUENTE OFRECE UN RENDIMIENTO SUPERIOR EN COMPARACIONA LAS FUENTES THERMALTAKE . SU PRECIO ES MUY BUENO , Y ME HA FUNCIONADO CORRECTAMENTE . NO DUDEN EN COMPRARLA .  
2	  This was a great camera back in it 's day but it 's long been replaced by the D40 and the D40 is on its way out now too . Why a camera that you can buy used for $ 300 is still listed as $ 1600 I don't know lol .  
2	  I use a PowerBook G4 17 " and I 'd recommend this sturdier adapter to anyone looking to replace their Apple one . I 'm completely satisfied with its performance .  
2	  I bought this as a gift to my dad on his retirement . He always wanted to go with Sony , specially when it comes to camcorders . This was a great product and definitely one of the better ones out of the whole lot . Price is also not too bad ( although if you wait a month or two you might find better deals in thanksgiving ) As always amazon . com had one of the best deals and not to forget its one of the highest trusted online shopping websites .  
2	  Finally an answer to driving in Alaska with no radio reception once you leave Anchorage-so no music . Rather than buy a CD system , the Kensington allows me to play all my favorites on my iPod . It also keeps the iPod charged .  
1	  This TV is not very sensitive and does not pick up stations very well . The unit does not work with an external power source and must be repaired which is an additional shipping cost . The bottom line : Another expensive useless piece of junk !  
2	  These are the most comfortable earphones , and they actually stay in my ears . Not to mention , they sound great ! I 've tried several other types of earphones and I always end up with sore ears . With these , I can wear them for 12 + hours during my long days at work and they never hurt one bit .  
1	  I like this radio a lot for all the reasons cited by other reviewers . Its Achilles Heel and fatal flaw is a cheesy switch for the On / Off / Freq selection which fails prematurely . I found only one other review which cited this problem . I have had two of these radios ( one an out of warranty replacement for a $ 75 fee ) and this switch failed gradually after about a year on both . By the way , my local strip mall battery shop put together rechargeable battery packs for me for this radio which I think were cheaper and certainly more convenient than ordering from Tivoli .  
2	  First , I have to say Amazon isnt lying when they say the price on this TV is a ' great deal ' considering I just bought this exact TV from [ store ] for about 400-500 dollars more . I went through all the Plasmas and LCD 's in [ store ] before deciding on this one . This TV was one of the best looking and one of the more unique ones in the store . The TV has a circular base which lets you move it as far right or left as you 'd like so no matter where you sit you can tilt it - But its so huge you probably wont need to .. You should definitely have this delivered considering the huge size and weight . Its 40 inches and its a widescreen . The TV is fairly easy to set up considering all the different features . It took me less than 10 minutes . You can connect a PC , a camcorder , and the standard things like DVD . It has everything . You can change screen sizes , freeze moving pictures , Daylight savings time , etc .. If youre looking for a very large TV with a good picture and reasonably priced then buy it . Try to buy it from Amazon and not the store because you get a better deal here . Overall , good value for the money and Highly Recommended .  
2	  I use these binoculars for field work , when counting hawks for the Golden Gate Raptor Observatory . It is important to be able to correctly identify and differentiate over 20 species of raptor , often at a distance of several miles , for our field work . These binoculars have a bright , clear image , with good color detail . They are rugged and water proof . I also use them when birding and photographing from my kayak . I spend hundreds of hours on the water each year , and I do not get on the water without them . I do not have to worry about them getting damaged or wet , as they very rugged , and if salt water gets on them , they just rinse off . Finally , after ten years of abuse , that not even my kayaks survived ( I am very hard on my gear , as I demand a lot from it ) they are slowly breaking down . I do not believe that the much more expensive higher end ones would have held up to this abuse any better , and so I just purchased the exact same pair as what I originally bought . These are bright enough , that at dusk , when the light begins to fail , that they actually gather more light than the human eye can . ( Kind of like a good telescope at night . ) To calculate the brightness of a pair of binoculars take the magnification level and divide it into the number representing the objective lens . These binoculars are 8x42 ( 8 is the magnification level and 42 is the size of the objective lens ) . 42/8 = 5.25 Four is the minimum number that you want . Five is very nice in bright , and will give you a very colorful image . In fact , it is so bright that at dusk , you will be able to see more clearly through the binocular than you will with your naked eye , since the binoculars will actually be gathering light for you . Using this criteria , these binoculars are right up there with many of the best . A 10x42 will not be as bright , since 42/10 = 4.2 , a marked decrease in amount of light , though still quite good . I recently got the newer open body version of the Brunton Echo 8x42 binocular ( I put my binoculars through a lot , and thought it best to have a back up pair ) , and I thought it would be the same as the older full body version seen here . They are not . Quality control has gone down hill , so make sure you get the full body version and not the open body version .  
1	  I was very disappointed with this mic . I wanted to be able to do interviews at a construction site . Even though we were several 100 yards away and there was little machinery running at the time , the audio was poor . I had a constant hiss in the audio . The mic is very light weight and feels cheap , almost like a " toy " mic . Since SONY makes sure you can use only their mics , you don't have much choice . I am thinking about getting their wireless mic , but after seeing the quaility of this one , I 'm a little hesitant to buy another SONY mic .  
1	  This Transcend 2GB , 120x has not failed yet , but the Transcend 2GB 80x CF card that I purchased a month earlier failed and I lost some very important images . I was using it in my Canon 30D . I tried several different Software Recovery programs to retreive the images and none of them worked . I have tried to contact Transcend Technical Support through their website but they failed to respond . I do not recommend Transcend CF cards . This experience has taught me to pay a little more and stick with the proven brands , Sandisk , Lexar and Kingston .  
1	  After reading all the reviews , everyone saying how wonderful this is and how many channels you pull in , I bought it . Sure I only paid a few bucks , but you get what you pay for . I set this high and next to a window , and living 30 minutes from Seattle I expected I 'd pick up a few-abc NBC CBS but no - strangely I can only pick up ch13 out of Bellingham which is about 50 mins away ? Oh and I Bring in 4 channels of 24 hour religion so I can go to church whenever I like and whatever I 'm dressed in . Overall , I don't think it 's worth the time unless you live IN a major broadcasting city . Not the outskirts . Still TV Less , I will continue to let the cable companies have it - streaming tv for me still -  
1	  I don't know who in the real world averages 5 % coverage , which is Canon 's spec for getting 2000 prints out of this unit . So you can't believe you 'll get anywhere near 2000 prints . I 've been averaging about 600 . I love my MF4270 printer and get great quality prints , but the toner life is completely unacceptable .  
1	  I was a loyal Ritek user for some time . I bought these exact discs in May of this year and burned them on a number of drives . Scans at the time showed very low error levels . This weekend I rescanned and ALL the discs had increases in error levels of over 1000 % , many were barely readable . Draw your oown conclusions .  
2	  This is a perfect splitter . I measured my signal strength before and after installing , and did not see any signal loss . It is easy to install and feels like high quality . Two mounting screws are included . Very happy .  
1	  Bought this bag because I wanted a bag on wheels and the price was reasonable and came with free shipping but I wouldn't buy it again . There is limited room for paperwork or any assessories and since the handle is on the back , you cannot put anything on the back . Since you put things in the front , the bag leans forward and falls . It was not designed thoroughly .  
1	  I won this in a drawing so for something free , I can't complain too much . However after maybe 2-3 uses , it no longer plays even after charging . The play button seems to have been pushed in and no longer clicks . This may be a reason why I can't get it playing . I won't get a replacement .  
1	  As of right now , I am an Apple Student DeveloperMost of my work comes from Filmmaking , as I 'm an Independent Filmmaker , and all of my post production work relies heavily upon my Apple G5 Tower , as well as a TON of external harddrive storageWhile some of my LaCie HD 's have worked great , many of them have simply failed mehere are the pro 's -1 . great interface - both FireWire 400 and 800 , and they are easy to daisychain2 . they are fast - 7200 RPM , and usually , if the drive is good , the performance will showCONS -1 . very weak body - forget if you drop this thing even one inch - it 'll be dead2 . very tough to hookup to other drives - when I say this , I mean it is impossible to stack this drive , or try and put it in a space where it 'll stay putTHE BIGGEST PROBLEM -I don't know what accounts for this - whether its the bridge or the drive itself - but LaCie 's drives fail way too muchI 've probably purchased around 14 LaCie drives in the past 4 years , for varioius film projects and associate ones - of the 14 , I have had 5 completely fail on meThis is simply unacceptable for any drive companywhen you consider it all , companies like MAXTOR offer drives with the same interface , same speeds , but at a lower pricewith that said , take a look at MAXTOR , whose drives are housed in a very indestructive body ( .. ) On a sidenote , LaCie has honored the warranties on their drives , and when they 're open , their customer service is very helpful - but I 've lost too much data , at this point , to recommend them  
1	  This cable was very inexpensive . I should have known that it would not work . The cabe itself is a very cheap made in China product , with very thin ( small gauge ) cord . Even if the cable did work , I doubt that it would have been able to work properly over 15 ft given the limitations on data transmission created by the very thin wire gauge .  
2	  I will never use my apple ear-buds again . These sound simple amazing . Only problem is that they feel a little uncomfortable tucked into my ear channel . But that 's the nature of the ear-buds .  
1	  If you like to take pictures with macro lense , it sucks . I 've had many canon cameras and this one takes the the prize for worst quality . If you get closer than five inches , the pictures messes up . I 've had no other problem with the hardware , though I hate carrying around that dock and it 's odd shaped charger . No other charger cable in the world is going to fit ! So loose it and you 're screwed . oh , and night photos also suck . BIG TIME , even with the flash on .

1	  I bought this camera b / c a family member had a good experience with an Aiptek 3.1 megapixel palm camcorder . Unfortunately , this one does not have the same quality . One of my biggest beefs is that the controls are kind of flimsy . Also , when I tried to take the cover off a panel with the A / V output , headphone jack , etc . , it snapped right off . Whoops ! Still pictures turn out ok , though nowhere near the level of those taken by my Canon Digital Elph ( I expected as much , considering the price difference in these products ) . The mp3 player seems to work ok and the quality is decent . Video quality is unfortunately very poor and quite choppy , even at the highest resolution setting . It looks like some kind of stop-action animation and is suitable only for short clips to post to the web . The files produced are quite large in size ( not MPEG-4s as advertised ) , but can be reduced to smaller wmvs with other software . I pretty much figured I would keep this as almost a ' disposable ' camera . For the price , if something happens to it , I won't be too upset . It will be the toy to bring along on a hiking trip , a geocaching quest , an archaeological dig , or a canoe excursion down the river . This would probably be a fun toy for the kids . For serious camcorder use , not recommended . It is very true that you get what you pay for in this case . I will be keeping my very old JVC VHS-C camcorder for the time being for ' real ' video applications , but I 'll still use this for times when it doesn't matter as much ..  
2	  We use this in our home office . It replaced a print-only device so both of us could scan documents ( we scan everything and discard the paper ) . The network scanning feature is excellent , allowing anyone in the office to scan over the network . Print quality is good , no jam issues . Others mentioned issues with envelopes , but I 've never had a single problem . This is a very quiet machine , and unlike many other laser printers , doesn't stink up the room .  
2	  I have it and it is a great item for cube farms or quieter situations . I use it for my portable DVD player so that the speaker can be by me and the screen further away . I also use it at work on my work PC for music and can keep the speaker closer to the keyboard for better sound than normal speakers without bothering others .  
2	  This product deserves a boost in Amazon ratings , so I simply want to tell a prospective buyer that this machine prints superb photos and crisp , clear documents . If you follow the installation instructions , everything works fine . I have XP Home and had no problem whatsoever with the installation . It looks really slick also and you can add an additional paper tray and 2 sided printing unit . This machine is well worth the money .  
1	  Good sound , comfort , and isolation were my selection criteria . These headphones isolate exterior noise to degree I never experienced before , with my Sony or Koss phones . Sure , the [ .. ] Bose may do it better , but I 'm not spending that kind of cash on headphones . The sound is very good whether connected to my Iriver 320 or my Denon 3802 receiver or to my pc . I boosted the bass a little just because I like it that way . They are comfortable and unobtrusive . I was power walking with them on and my ears did get warm after a few miles , but that was to be expected . Normal sitting and listening , no problem . I think the Sennheiser HD-280 are an excellent value . Well made , sturdy , unlike the Sony MDR-XD400 which I originally purchased . I returned the Sony 's the same day because they were cheaply made and the sound quality poor . The Sony sound was bad due to a poor design i.e. if anything , including the cord , a chair cushion , your hand , touched the outside of a phone , the rubbing sound was amplified and very noticable , drum like . They were junk .  
1	  It is not worth it to buy these headphones instead of $ 15-$20 Sony , Nike or Koss headphones . I was looking for an upgrade over that basic level and I thought this would be it . I was wrong . Yes , the sound quality is better but the headphones have many downsides . First , I 've owned the headphones for 7 months and the wire covering is already frayed . Second , the length of the cord is insanely long and incredibly annoying . And finally , they only do an average job of staying put in the ear while running , especially that they claim to have the twist to fit system . Save money , buy something else .  
2	  Product arrived on time , fit the laptop perfectly , and proved to be a great gift .  
2	  Switched from Windows to Linux and dumped my Pocket PC PDA for this . Does everything I need it to and the battery life is great  
2	  This is a nice little gadget . It folds and unfolds well , feels like a laptop keyboard , and has some nice function keys . One drawback is that it feels a bit " flimsy " - you do need a hard surface to set it on when it 's unfolded . Also , my Tab key does not work - I 'd advise you to check the thing carefully before buying it . Aside from that , it 's a great little gadget . I am a freelance translator / editor , and until I got this thing , I thought I needed a laptop . Now I don't .  
2	  The price of the radio is quite excellent ! Its only drawback is that the tuning is manual , and not digital : due to the sensitivity tuning dial 's small size , adjustment is often necessary , which a digital tuner would avoid . However , a digital tuner would probably increase the radio 's fantastic price !  
2	  The following categories are ranked in order of importance ( with the top ones , like comfort , being most important for headphones in my opinion ) . Comfort : 8/10Sound : 8/10Soundstage : 9/10Bass : 7/10Durability : 8/10Value : 10/10Isolation : 3/10Style : 6/10Volume Sensitivity : 9/10-Overall : 9/10-Comfort : 8/10For full-size cans , these have insane comfort . They 're so comfortable that if they 're within eyesight , you literally start to feel bad that your head isn't cushioned between those nice , puffy earpads . I 've worn them for 9 hours straight ( anime marathon ) without any discomfort . The pressure of the earcups on the sides of my head is enough so that the headphones won't fall over if I 'm out jogging , and definitely nowhere near the pain from the Sennheiser HD202 's vicegrip . It 's also VERY lightweight for full-size headphones . The earcups vertically adjust to your ears really well , and My ears don't get hot / itchy wearing them . The only thing is that they are just the slightest bit small for someone like me who has a large head . If the earpieces would just elongate by one more notch , the comfort would be perfect . Sound : 8/10Love it . I 'm running these unamped , but I 've heard the sound on these scales much better with a quality amp / DAC . Fun fact : these headphones have the legendary Koss KSC75 drivers built in - these drivers are even praised by audiophiles for how amazing they sound at such a low price ( Check the reviews for KSC75 's sound ) . Scorewise , I 'm playing it safe because I 've never heard what the Sennheiser HD800 or other really high end headphones sound like , but they 're probably a lot better ( and 50 times pricier ! ) . But make sure you give it some decent burn-in time - at least 100 hours - I didn't quite like the sound right out of the box , but they 're sucking up my free time right now . The best thing is , the sound is actually really fun to listen to , unlike the dark , boring , cave-like sound from the Sennheiser HD202s . Soundstage : 9/10Try giving it some virtual surround sound , and just smile throughout the experience - these headphones have great soundstage and positioning , especially if you mod out the foam behind the drivers . It sometimes feels like you know where every note is coming from , and some notes feel relatively farther away than other notes . Whenever I watch movies or any other high quality media with these on , I just can't help noticing how " real " everything sounds - it almost feels like you 're in a concert auditorium or movie theater , the soundstage is just that good . You 're really in for a treat if you feed these headphones some high quality instrumental music ( eg . I 'm listening to the Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack at the moment , and I know the game didn't sound this good through my TV speakers ! ) Bass : 7/10Honestly , I 've never really owned real bassy headphones , so its possible that I may be a little off on this rating , but I just wish it had a bit more bass - then it would be even more fun to listen to . I think that because the drivers are positioned at a small distance from your ears , you can't really " feel " the bass that well , but it 's definitely there ( unlike the Sennheiser PX100 , which has less bass than the UR40 , but since it 's an on-ear type , you kind of " feel " the bass more with it than with the UR40 ) . These do have adequate bass though - it 's the " full " kind of bass that you 'd feel indirectly , as if you were at a band concert or movie theater - just not the sharp kind of bass that shakes and hammers your head . Whether that 's a pro or con for you is your decision . Durability : 8/10Yeah , it definitely has solid build . I know several people who have used these headphones for years . Just collapse them and stuff them in the corner of your backpack - they 're designed for this kind of treatment . The wire is pretty thin though , but it makes the wire so much more lightweight and manageable , and although it 's thin it really feels solid . Value : 10/10Really , the value is superb for $ 25 at Amazon , but I was lucky to steal these for much less elsewhere . I doubt you will find headphones with a better ratio of comfort , sound , soundstage , and durability than these under $ 50 ( unless you absolutely need isolation ) . Isolation : 3/10If I put the music at a moderate listening volume , set them down and walk to the opposite corner of my dorm room , I can hear ~ 10 % of the music pretty clearly . Also , unless if you turn the sound up , these will leak in some noise from your environment - these are definitely not closed headphones . And honestly , if you really want to make these closed , just stick some duct tape to the side grills to dampen the leakage , but be aware that the clear , open , fun sound ( especially the soundstage ) might suffer as a result . Style : 6/10Yeah , they may look just a bit goofy on your head , but honestly , this barely fazes me . They 're really designed with comfort and usability ( collapsible ) in mind first , and style second . Volume Sensitivity : 9/10Wow . Plug in my Panasonic RP-HT21 , and turn up my laptop 's volume to 45 % for moderate listening volume . Plug in these headphones , and I have to turn down the volume to 25 % for equivalent loudness . Take off the headphones and turn up the volume to 100 % , and you 've got full laptop-speaker sound . Really sensitive ! Misc : It 's collapsible ! Yes , this feature isn't quite as prominent as with the Sennheiser PX100 , but at least it 's there . The cord length is only like 3-4 feet , which actually is a plus in my eyes - if you need more cord length , just buy a cable extender ( for a dollar at Amazon ) . Final thoughts : Just buy it , and MAKE SURE to give it a lot of burn-in time in the beginning ( basically , don't go with your first impression of how it sounds the day you receive it . ) Really , if you burn it in , you won't be disappointed unless you 're used to listening to $ 100 sound , or are looking for isolating headphones . Out of the headphones I 've listened to , I would recommend these over the Sennheiser PX100 ( the sound on the UR40 just seems " fuller " ( ifrom ts circumaural design ) and more fun , and the Sennheisers cost more than the UR40 ) , Sennheiser HD202 ( good sound quality , but terribly boring to listen to , and very uncomfortable ) , and Panasonic RP-HT21 ( Honestly , I didn't know how tinny the sound from the Panasonics really were before listening to the UR40 ) . I dare you to find headphones with a better ratio of comfort , sound , soundstage , and durability than these headphones under $ 50 .  
2	  I just received this cable and I immediately installed it on my Onkyo 5.1 Speaker system and wow , what a difference . First thing when you get this cable , you will see how much thicker this cable is than the ones that you get in with like home theater in a box or just speakers in general . I was blown away by the difference in speaker sound quality and just the depth that the speakers get with an upgrade on cables . So keep in mind , whenever you are not satisfied with sound quality coming from your home theater system , first thing to do is try and upgrade is your cabling . Overall satisfied with this purchase .  
2	  Works great . I use it to connect from my netbook to my usb port on my sound system . I have all my music on my netbook and I love being able to sit in my recliner and punch up tunes .  
1	  I have the Ipod classic which is why I bought this but it doesnt quite fit and was uncomfortable .  
1	  This is extremely hard to set-up ! I still have not been able to use it ( had it for several weeks ) . Charged it as per instructions , but when I try to set it up , it says it can't find the program ( I have Windows XP ) . Have tried many times with no luck . I do not recommend this product . Instructions with it do not work when you follow them .  
2	  This RAM cooler is good for any 184 pin , 4 slot configuration of SDRAM . Installationis relatively straight-forward . I got the instructions from the ThermalTake website , which gives you Detail Specificatons , and Assembly Views . [ .. ] I installed it in an older Gateway E-4600 P4 1.6Ghz system , which uses Rambus . This works fine , see my picture . The shields fit right over the heat spreaders of Rambusmodules . The kit includes 2 clips which you fit over the module and cooler shields . If you have SDRAM without a heat spreader , you would add the insulator strip that ismounted with double-sided tape , not removing the strip which will face towards yourmemory chips on the module . The insulator strip is mounted on the A1165 shield onthe inside of it towards the top on the flat area . Remove the module the shield withthe fan will be attached to after unplugging your system , and discharging the memorymodules by holding in the power button on the case for 20-30 seconds . Attach insulating strip on inside of the cooler shield by removing the cover strip . Do notremove the other one facing the RAM chips or all you are left with is a glue strip . Clip on the fan / shield assembly using the clips provided seating the clip over theshield into the depressed area , and over the RAM module . This fits snug once seated . Do the same procedure for the other shield that doesn't have the fan attached . Theninsert your RAM module without the fan first . Install the RAM module with the fannext . BE CAREFUL when re-installing your memory modules , making sure you press onthe bottom of the shield while inserting , and avoiding capacitors and components onthe motherboard . If you nick one of them , it 's possible to create a short and blowup your memory modules . The ' cans ' of the electrolytic capacitors have ( + ) voltageon them , and contact with the shield will cause a short ! Now you can route the 3-wire fan supply wire to your CPU motherboard plug using somekind of in-line splitter , or another fan plug on the motherboard . Mine had an extraone for the case fan I added , so I used the splitter ( Syba SY-CAB65007 ) . This madefor a very neat installation after routing and adding wire ties . The 40mm cooler fanis also replaceable if it dies later , without disturbing the rest of installation . BE CAREFUL when installing the mounting clips , that they do not come in contact withany exposed circuit parts of your memory modules . It should rest on top of the chipson the opposite side of the shield for modules without a heat spreader . The shieldsprovide minimal heat transfer . The fan does most of the work , forcing cooler air onthe modules and through the slots , and a rear case fan removes the warm air . I see adifference of - 10 to - 15C using a thermocouple attached to the Rambus spreader . Therear case fan also exhausts more warmer air now , so this does work !  
2	  I removed an older Napco security system and installed the ELK M1 Gold . Found it to be very simple to install and program with the ethernet option . Directions are decent but not written for a newbie . Good support from ELK once you register and they allow you to logon into their website .  
1	  This is slow to install , dificult to take anywhere , and slow to transfer info . Buy a USB connected ZIP or better yet , for this kind of money you should be able to get a CD-RW .  
2	  I bought this product to go with a new Onkyo AV Receiver . It works great ! The only question I had when hooking it all up was that I could not find it written anywhere that you didn't need a separate audio cable from the Tuner to the Receiver . Turned out the cable that came with the tuner , ( a DIN type ) , provided everything needed . I still don't know why there is a Optical Out Audio Jack if you don't need it .  
2	  I listened to the system before I bought it . The systen is easy to install . For someone like me , who can barely change a lightbulb , I actually ENJOYED the set-up process . Bose makes it idiot proof and entertaining . The sound is just great and it is easy to use . I haven't left my couch in 3 days . If you want a good ststem to play CD 's and DVD 's and want to watch television and movies in surround sound , this system is a great choice . It wasn't the cheapest product available , but the sound is great and the equipment is so unobstrusive , it is nearly invisible in my family room . No hype , just good sound . Go for it . No regrets here ..  
1	  This camera was a big disappointment . It is my first , and so far , only digital camera . My sister has a different brand camera and whenever we have family get-togethers , I have to have her email me the pictures or put them on a CD for me . I won't even bother to bring my own digital camera .. the flash hardly ever goes off ! I have tried different batteries .. AA and rechargeable and it makes no difference . I am 100 % sure the batteries are fully charged and the flash rarely goes off .. even if I have it set to " Flash On " .. And , like some other reviewers have said , the battery life does not last long and there is very little space on the camera itself for pictures . An SD card is a must , but I would not recommend this camera to my worst enemy . Sorry , but that has been my experience . On the few occasions that the flash actually DID go off , the pictures did come out great , though . Frustrating to use when you are about to take a great picture and NO flash . No fun .  
2	  This cord cost less than 1/3 of the ones available @ Bestbuy and is just as good . Bought my mom a DVD up-convert for her 47 " 1080p and this cord worked instantly and looked gorgeous .  
1	  Powerbook G4 SuperDrive . They burn and verify just fine , but when I reinsert them tghey come up unreadable . I just burned the Solaris 10 Install DVD from an ISO image . Burned fine , verified fine , but when I try to install from it I get read errors . Same ISO , same burner , using a CompUSA private label DVD + R gives me a usable install DVD . Before a computer upgrade , I burned my iPhoto Library to one of these . It verified fine , then after I 'd wiped my drive it came up upreadable . Lost a couple dozen photos , so I 'm not as livid as I would be if this was my only backup . Still . That DVD will mount on a Windows machine ; ISOBuster sees all three filesystems , but attempting to read anything gives me a CRC error . Do plenty of testing before you trust anything to these .  
1	  It not work on my hp 3955 . I was call HP 3 times , but I get the difference answer every time . , finally they told me the negative answer . And told me my PDA was out of guarantee , need to call the tech . support with charge . ( $ ) ( They care about customer pay them only , don't care about what is the customeron feeling ) sandisk was give me the answer fast than HP . ( it was not work on it card w / memory , but it was too late ) Some one told we don't check the website before we buy it , but it was hard to get the answer sometime . before I order it card , I was read the review from someone on amazon site to told , it was working on hp 3955 , but it was not !  
1	  didnt work must of been defective , and why do you need so many words to make this work ahh  
1	  Do not buy from this seller , I bought a mic . and never received , I sent an e-mail and they said he was waiting for UPS for an answer where was the mic , I 've had to write to know my purchase ! Do not waste your money because you do not receive your product . This mic is one of the best , buy in a store but not here on Amazon .  
1	  This cable has a horrendous design flaw . The cable is snagless , so there 's a piece of white plastic that covers the little clear plastic pin that secures the cable once connected . The problem ? You would assume this small plastic cover is made out if a flexible material , so it can be depressed when you need to unplug the cable right ? Not rocket science , it 's just a piece of flexible white plastic right ? Guess what .. It isn't . The material it 's made of is hard as a rock . Once the cable was plugged in , and I tried to depress this thing because I needed to unplug and reposition the cable , and this thing wouldn't budge at all . You press it so hard your fingertips hurt and IT WON'T BEND AT ALL . I even tried using pliers to no avail . Who designed this thing ? Now , the cable is perpetually hooked onto the switch port I plugged it in and it simply can't be unplugged . I never imagined someone could mess up something as simple as a CAT6 cable but guess what . They managed to do so . The performance of the cable is pretty much what was expected in case your wondering . Just know that wherever you plug this cable , it will still remain , long after humans no longer inhabit the earth .  
1	  This item broke after 11 uses and stopped working with the radio at that point I discarded it I won't purchase it again  
1	  It looks like original nikon battery pack , but technically it has fault . When I have used with my two fully charged Nikon EN-EL3e batteries , it gave me only couple of hour , after that it shows battery low signal at my D200 display panel . I have tried to use 6 X AA batteries , but they are pathetic . I am not at all satisfied with this product .  
1	  The drive ran fine for 6 months , then failed without warning . A disaster ! Do not buy this drive !  
1	  I used it only 3 weeks . Later , a lot of problems began . At the present : I prefered to buy other one . Don't waste your money  
1	  This camera takes quality pictures , but we did not find it to be very well constructed . The diopter ( view finder adjustment ) stopped working in the first 90 days , and the film advance mechanism failed about one year later . We take a lot of pictures , but do not treat the camera roughly . Even with the instructions , we were not able to make the " date-stamp " work correctly . My wife also had occassional trouble loading the film . The optics seem to be good , but overall we were un-impressed . We were able to get a full refund using an extended warranty offered through our credit card provider . We originally paid about $ 150 brand new .  
2	  These headphones are by far my favorite that I 've had in a long time . For me , being with not that much money , I don't have enough to be buying $ 100 + headphones , so when I was in need of a new set , and saw these for $ 10 , I just bought them , hoping it would be good . And they were . The sound is better than any set of headphones I 've used in a very long time . And the fact that it covers your whole ear , it blocks out a lot of outside sound . It is very comfortable too . The only bad thing about them is the dual-volume . It 's really just very unecessary , maybe even more annoying than that , because sometimes when I 'm done with them , I put them down , and something will hit the volume knob . It doesn't happen too often , and won't happen if you 're wearing them . I 've laid in my bed many times with them on and the volume wasn't touched . Overall , it 's a great buy . I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't have tons of money , and wants good headphones .  
1	  I bought this cord and when I plugged it in the quality of the image was not very good . It seemed like there was a connection problem because if i moved the cord and got it in just the right position then it would work . But most of the time there were little lines all across the tv . I then purchase another cord ( a little more expensive ) from radio shack and it works great .  
2	  Most of the iPod cases out there are not very convenient . I carry mine in my pocket and like to reach in and change songs without looking . The ones with the covers are out . This one feels great in your hand , good grip , and very smooth scroll wheel use . Not very convenient for use with any docks ( ie . iHome radio ) as you have to take it out of the case . It isn't very easy to remove and put back on . So great protection but inconvenient for docking stations .  
2	  Those who know technology , SanDisk is one of the best in Memory Cards . They last long & come with a 5 year limited manufacturer warranty honored by SanDisk ( The warranty part offcourse isn't the best out there as much as I know as a consumer ) , compatible with most devices including computers / camera / games / sd readers etc . I bought it from amazon for their best prices out there at that time , as usual .  
1	  I bought this camera with the Pyle PLTS77DU 7-Inch Touchscreen Monitor . I also reviewed that , which has a lot of the same info as this .. I installed the unit myself in a Mitsubishi galant 2003 . It was surprisingly easy , even though I only had basic wiring skills . I also installed a back up camera at the same time . The toughest part of the installation is running wire from the trunk to the dash underneath the trim . The dash installation was a breeze , just search YouTube for installation videos . The camera only works in Aux mode . I tried connecting to the " rear view in " connection but then no video comes through at all . I use the " aux video in " connection and switch to the rear view manually , which really bugs me . I gave this unit 2 / 5 stars because I only bought the touch screen to go hand in hand with a rear view camera . Since both products are made by Pyle , I would expect for it to work flawlessly . Instead , The camera works when I put the car in reverse and switch the dash to aux but I think the video should automatically come up on my screen like all the other dash / camera combos . The camera isn't as wide of an angle as other rear view cameras out there but in my opinion , it looks fine . I bought it primarily for the purpose of backing up into my garage , and it works beautifully for that purpose . The night vision is neat . People glow in the dark . It 's a $ 20 camera so you can't expect it to be Hollywood quality . For the money , I am extraordinarily happy with this unit , minus the issue with automatically displaying the camera feed . Help me get the camera to pop up automatically and this unit gets 5 stars !  
2	  This router was really easy to set up using the CD that came with it . No problems . I recommend this product .  
2	  Years later , still using it , sound is vibrant and thumping . Do they still make these ? I could use another set . It was a great deal at the time .  
2	  Just purchased . I also bought Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 . This Tablet works great with PSE 4.0 . No glitches . Took me less than five minutes out of box to be working in PSE 4.0 . Also works great with Art Rage 2 , a drawing program which is pressure sensitive . I use a pc machine running windows XP .  
2	  These headphones reduct 80 + dB of airplane noise to a resonable level so that one can concentrate on grading papers or other things that take concentration . Very nice purchase .  
2	  I have used my camera on a cross country road trip and its everything i could ask for , for a film camera .. easy to use and great for any kinds of shots ..  
2	  The pros1 ) It charges quickly . 2 ) Nice crisp sound . 3 ) The controls are intuitive . 4 ) It comes with a nice arm strap . 5 ) Does not reset itself every third or forth use ( like the rio sport I had previously ) . 6 ) Nice and small . The cons1 ) The ear buds don't stay put if you get sweaty . I run 15-25 miles a week so this is a problem for me . Fortunately , I already had the ear buds from the Rio I just tossed . 2 ) The battery is not replaceable . If it dies , you toss the unit . 3 ) You have to use their software to load music on the player . No coping mp3 files right to the player . This was anoying to me as they seem to want you to also use their software to play mp3 's on your computer as well . Grr . This is perhaps my biggest complaint . All in all a nice unit . Beats my old Rio hands down ..  
2	  For the price you can't go wrong . Fit my sony cyber shot perfectly I love this little product it gets the job done ! Very impressed !  
1	  My pair of etymotic stopped functioning after 13 months . Coincidentally Etymotics warranty period is for 1 year after purchase .. Why is this the case when companies such as Monster provide a 3 year warranty ? I contacted Etymotic hoping they would at least repair my earphones and they suggested I buy a new pair .. I 'm not going to buy another pair and I am staying away from Etymotic .  
1	  I ordered this item in mid July . It is now early December . I only use the item about 1 hour a day most days to do my audio French lessons , Other than that it sits on my desk all day . Already the cord is beginning to fray on either side of the safety clasp at the back . There is a place on the right where the wire has come out of the material and the left side where the earbud wire connects to the big black piece that leads into the main strap has stripped to bare wire . It still work but it looks very shabby and I suspect that bare wire will soon break if I don't do something to reinforce it . Junk .  
1	  Unfortunately I cannot give much of a review because the adapter did not work . It fit into my stereo but shuffle would not work . The prong for the shuffle to sit on doesn't seem to fit correctly , it seems to small . My son took a dremel to a plastic piece on the adaptor and ground at off and he got it to come on it we jiggled it a bit , but when you let go it would not play . I had to go out and buy an audio cable and will still have to charge my shuffle on my PC .  
1	  I am not a Christian , but the premise of this book was so fascinating that I checked it out from my local library . I am SO GLAD I did not buy it ! The first few chapters are rather interesting ; I very much liked the idea of shaking up the Vatican , and initially I liked Bill Kelly . But his kids were of the saccharine overly precocious sitcom type that I abhor to listen to . His daughter 's conversion seemed completely unrealistic and tacked on . All conversations in the book are stilted , and too many opportunities for real theological and philosophical considerations fall by the wayside , presumably to make room for silly and clunky subplots involving the pope 's children . There is always room , however , for the clumsy , turgid presentation of the authors ' agenda , including a painful speech about AIDS being a punishment for homosexuality , right before an exended trip to Africa where AIDS is , even in the novel , clearly a heterosexual issue . Also , there is the odd statement that the majority of Americans are pro-life , which is simply not true , according to any poll I 've ever seen . I also disliked the characterization that OF COURSE the gay couple was exceptionally attractive , as if gay people must be exceptional in every way to straight people . Equally annoying were their thinly veiled references to Clinton , unfailingly referred to as " the American president . " His identity was obvious , so why be coy with the name ? I would have given this novel only one star for the writing which only very occasionally achieved mediocrity , but they did have an interesting idea , so I gave them the second star for that .  
2	  Well , I don't really know how to say it any other way but , it does what its supposed to . I bought this card for my LG Fusic and i use it everyday for about an hour to listen to music and it has never failed on me . The only thing I have noticed is that sometimes when I take a picture with my phone that picture becomes corrupt ( this has only happened twice ) and I don't know if my phone is to blame or the actual mircroSD card .  
1	  Bought this in September for use in my apartment . It works fine when browsing but completely drops your connection if you attempt to do any heavy downloading . Turns out that this router has a 32 connection max . So , if you use bittorrent to download the latest linux distro , be prepared for your internet to cut out within 10 minutes . I have to restart the router every time this happens . Spend the extra money and get any of the other routers which allow over 200 connections .  
2	  Having been hooked up via a Netgear hub for the past two years , I wondered if I could gain any networking improvements by installing a switch . I was concerned by some articles relating to their ' configuration ' however . Well , as one reviewer has already said , " it took longer to take it out of the box than to install it ! " . Hooked up the four workgroup PCs and VOILA .. everything just came back up as though nothing had been altered , EXCEPT for the new SPEED ! Don't hesitate on buying this little beauty !  
1	  I found that the camera was not as good as they had admitted . Oh dont get me wrong for the price it 's great ( for outdoors in daylight ) it takes a good picture but still pixelated and it does show up " boxy "  
2	  The Grundig S350 looks & performs EXACTLY as specified . It performs in all bands really well here on the CDN border . I am very happy with the reception of all the stations that I could not previously listen to . Picking up distant AM & SW stations are easy to do & lock in with ease .  
2	  Kodak EasyShare Z712 IS 7.1MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized ZoomI have been very happy with the results from this camera . It is easy to use and has many manual features that are very good .  
2	  SanDisk 4 GB Cruzer Titanium USB Flash Drive with U3Excellent Thumb Drive . But lose the U3 software - it does not always work well with some computers . I do enjoy the durability of the Drive !  
1	  survived about 2 years , had to replace the battery after one year - expensive and hard to find . Then bought a second battery but the unit is shot . This thing makes all kinds of complicated loud beeping noises that are not easy to stop and do not clearly help you diagnose why it 's beeping in the first place .  
1	  This cable works to hardwire your GPS , but for my application ( BMW R1200RT ) the cables were too short and therefore useless .  
1	  Bought this in November of 2009 and it died in March of 2010 . Didn't actually quit , it just started giving the infamous " service required " message . From what I can find on the ' net , this usually means that the antenna has failed it 's self calibration test and must be returned to Beltronics for adjustment ; makes sense because the unit suddenly started running a " Self Cal " test every couple of days about two weeks prior to it failing , something it had never done before . It probably could be returned under warranty given it failed within four months except for the fact that Amazon is not an authorized seller and purchasing for a non-authorized seller voids it 's 1 year warranty . I suspect the cost of returning the unit for repair is going to be prohibitively high ; I have found postings on the net where the cost of this type repair was a flat rate $ 80.00 , which is over 50 % of what I paid for it . However when it was working , it really was very good at alerting in plenty of time to keep you out of trouble . My work commute is 47 miles one way and it saved me from a sure ticket at least twice in the four months it worked . I am now using a Whistler Pro 78 SE . I have found that it has almost exactly the same range on K band as the V955 . I 've tested this using one of those " Your Speed Is " signs that is permanently installed on the interstate I drive to work . The Whistler alerts at the same distance the V955 did as gauged by a nearby streetlight . I suspect it will do as well or better on Ka band . The Whistler also has a better warranty ( 3 year vs . 1 year ) and as far as I know , buying from Amazon does not void it .  
2	  This little analog radio gets great reception and is just what I was looking for . Originally I thought it had come with no ear buds , but they were in fact in the bottom of the box . Hey ! I 'm old , what can I say . Anyway , I started short wave listening in 1960 . This little radio gets better & clearer reception then anything I had back then . Analog is not easy as digital , but more fun . It takes a little getting use to if you haven't done it . I have had the radio only a few days & have logged quite a few distant stations . The fm & am quality is equal to that of the short wave  
2	  I 've been using these tapes to label cds and dvds for two years now . The quality is consistent and i 've had only 1 defective ribbon out of 250 . The pricing at Amazon is reasonable at 3 for $ 19.99 or $ 6.99 each .  
1	  Two pieces of hard plastic . Don't know how long it will survive my teen . Doesn't seem to be the sturdiest thing in the world . Time will tell . Slightly cheesy .  
1	  Scanner arrived and I scanned a total of 6 slides before the power supply quit working . I wanted another one sent but after waiting 4 weeks , Amazon cancelled the order and said they were unable to get a replacement . Amazon was not the problem , Konica / Minolta was .  
1	  I bought these from Costco ( and unfortunately tossed away the purchase slip when the TV Ears worked ) . They worked alright , for just two days , then quit . While they worked , I was quite happy since my hearing impairment is extreme . I thought that I would now be able to listen to TV and especially watch movies . From other reviews I see that there is serious quality control problem with this company . I would never bother with them again .  
2	  Note that it is NOT a 48-bit scanner but a 24-bit scanner . It is also NOT USB 2.0 High-Speed ( 480Mbps ) but USB 2.0 Full-Speed ( 12Mbps , the same as USB 1.1 ) . Scan quality is good for greyscale but just okay for photos . Good things about this scanner is that it is powered by USB bus power ( 500mA ) and it can be installed vertically . However , there are other hassles with the scanner like one have to remove any existing TWAIN scanner driver , or the scanner will not work correctly ( in my case , I have EPSON TWAIN scanner driver installed ) . You can check the spec . ..  
2	  Great Product . I ordered one for myself and then ordered one for the VFW Auxliary Kitchen . It is greatly appreciated to find a crockpot so large for home use .  
1	  This will be a perfect product for linking two of the similar products are to be links . Good for Office to Office connection . We have a few telecomuters who are using Mac and Windows XP and this was the worst purchase I have ever made . If any of the mobile users are using VoIP then just add a ton of issues to this . I am able to connect to my older LinkSys router with Linux , Mac , Windows ( all types )  
2	  I ordered these as a high pass filter for car speakers to protect them from excessive bass and bottoming out , they did what I needed . The parts were delivered quickly and at a reasonable price  
1	  The previous version Trendnet TEW card for wireless G worked really well for me . So I was hoping for same experience in upgrading to Trendnet wireless N. But unfortunately this card have stability problem and would often disconnect . Now I 've to constantly do a manual disconnect and reconnect to establish network connection . I think it 's better that I revert back to the previous Trendnet wireless G.  
1	  This radio has a nice design making it pleasing to the eye , and it does have a good sound . I also found the green backlit display comforting at first . However , it is difficult to see the numbers at night unless able to look level with the clock . As I have it set up on a stand and need to look slightly up to see it , the numbers appear fuzzy . I also found the lack of a battery backup disturbing , along with the fact that it is not mentioned . It 's an okay clock radio but not one I would spend the money on again .  
2	  Thank goodness Philips was one of the first companies to trim the fat on the older vcr chasis box size standard . Also , commendations for including large heat vents on the side of this and other various Philips vcr models . After all , a large percentage of vcr equipment failing within the first 2 years or so is due to poor heat and air ventilation ; heat kills , end of story . This particular model makes one wonder if it 's even worth spending another ( $ ) or so for the S-VHS version ( not offered currently on Amazon . com ) . I 've compared both and found little difference unless you 're a heavy recorder . The S-VHS quality closely resembles the original recorded source but don't expect dvd calibre . On this regular hi-fi model there is a tad-bit of red color bleed ( look at objects or letters in red and notice the artifcat known as dot-crawl ) . Color bleed is when the electronics of any video medium , to certain degree in error , allow reds , some blues and greens to seep out of the objects ' or images ' edges causing a sort of smeared-edgy look . The audio hi-fi portion is very clear and dialogue is also very articulate . The hi-fi audio level is quite exceptional . I once owned a hi-end , reputable brand name vcr where the hi-fi audio was horrendous . It suffered from low sound level . The highs were lows and the bass had no " punch " . Dialogue was nothing but babble and the video always had a muddled and streaked look ( regardless of cleaning the heads or not ) . As for price , it 's almost average or acceptable when you compare buying a low-end dvd player for about ( $ ) . I would not spend more than ( $ ) for this vcr model . Also , previous reviewers who mentioned their previous / serious problems with this model , I too believe you . While this Philips model I purchased does not suffer ( yet ) from any problems , I have owned more expensive brand named vcrs and were shocked they did not last past 3-5 years under normal usage ( then , again what 's normal ) . In total sum , nothing more irritable and inconveninent than purchasing from a reputable brand name and having the unit fail you .. So far for me this has not been this case with this model ( and yes , I 've had it for quite some time ) ..  
2	  Amazon has great deals on this product - we use it in our DVD camcorder and it works great .  
2	  By itself .. it 's a " meh " player . I bought it with Rockbox in mind , contacted the seller first to make sure it was a v1 . Installed Rockbox and an 8GB microSDHC card ( you can only use a 2GB non-HC card with the original firmware ) , and I 'm good to go ! Rockbox ftw .  
1	  My wife purchased this for me as a gift . I found this device difficult to use and the software that goes along with it even harder to use . It is not intuitive . Apple 's iPod will probably eat their lunch - I don't own an iPod , but I 'm sure they 've explored usability . I could not get the device to power up after charging it , after a while I found the reset button on the back and that did the trick . Fast forward a year , I still don't have all my music collection on the device -I get error messages using the PC software and haven't had time to call their tech support during work hours . Online help and their website don't come close to addressing the issue . Thanks to Amazon reviewers , I 'll try the firmware update - which seems like I should have heard about from Creative since I registered the product , no ? I went skiing with the MP3 player up to Tahoe and in the cold , my one battery lasted about 7 hours - better than I expected . I 'm going to try adding the second battery if I can get the firmware updated and hopefully that will take it through the day . Sound quality once you learn how to use it is great . I had to sit through the online tutorial to learn how to use it . I don't expect to need training on consumer products like these anymore - they should be much more intuitive . You also need to outlay additional $ for a car adapter if you want one , there isn't one included . * Update September 2007 * Apple did , in fact , eat their lunch . I now have a video iPod and use it 20x more than this device . The iTunes software is so much easier . Run , don't walk , to Apple , folks !  
1	  The problem with this item is that all the software referenced in the user manual DOES NOT EXIST ! There are two utilities for managing the card that are just not available on the packaged CD or on the D-Link web site . This makes it absolutely worthless for using WPA2-AES encryption . " Customer Service " does not care and has stopped responding to my e-mails . Avoid this one !  
1	  A total pile of junk ! When I got it working it cuts my speed by over 1/2 .. give me a break . The reviews were correct . Save your money and get a WAP54G . It works great and won't bring your network speeds down to nothing . The manufacture doesn't play fair in that they don't clearly tell you that speeds will be cut in 1/2 or more . Who needs to do that with a WYFI ?  
2	  I needed a desktop power strip to fit underneath a riser I 've mounted some equipment on , and this Belkin fit perfectly . I particularly like the placement of the outlets on both the top and front side . Not much else to say other than it works great and is very compact .  
2	  Great product for a Sat-Ready head unit ! Plug and play .. couldn't be easier . Works exactly as advertised and after 6 months , no problems to report .  
2	  Simple cable , works great with my iMac and external HDD ; it 's more reliable than adapter .  
2	  This product works just as I expected . Although I found out after I bought this item that there was Pocketwizards . I still enjoy pulling this out and using it for short wireless tethering ao all my flashes .  
2	  There might be better words to call the sound they produce but ill call it spatial sounding . Its really different from what im used to , more direct placement sounding speakers . But for my personal application where its located in a nook only 1 foot from the rear wall and 1 " away from the side walls its as good as it gets . Soundstage is huge for its placement and it fills the room nicely . Due to its lack of bass it suits my needs best as most speakers tend to get muddy in its location in a hurry . The speaker seems to be crafted really well and its coating is gorgeous and suits my kitchen well , it looks way more pricey than it is . Amplifier matching is not simple with this beauty , i have tried several amps on them in its current placement and what works best for me was a Naim Uniqute in 2 channel mode . If this was in a surround setting using all mirage omd range it would be great as well , i know i tried it was pretty fun for the movies . Ive been messing around with speakers and amps for nearly a year now trying to figure out what sounds best here and even though this might not be the best it suits my family needs perfectly . Amps that i have tried and replaced Primaluna 1 , peachtree audio idecco and Manley itube . Speakers that came and went B & W ; 683 , Martin Logan source and Sonus Faber Liuto bookshelf . WOuld i use this in a real 2 channel setup given i had the space probably not , but the fault would not lie in how it sounds is that i am not use to the sound it produces , as in everything its all very personal . I gave this a four star rating based on a 2 channel system , but if it was on a surround for the price its a definite 5 .  
1	  These batteries are the sole reason I will never buy another Canon camera . I love my camera , but these batteries are over-priced and have a short lifespan . I 've been through four of these in the last couple of years , and part of the reason why is because they 're Lithium Ion . For the longest life , Lithium Ion batteries need to be topped off as often as possible , and should never be allowed to discharge completely ( every deep discharge cycle lowers the life of the battery considerably , and after 100 cycles , the average Li-Ion is at 75-85 % of original capacity ) . So , generally speaking , Lithium Ion is a lousy choice for a camera . Who takes ten shots and then tops off the battery ? NiCad is a FAR better choice for a camera , since NiCads SHOULD be completely discharged on a regular basis . I spent a few hundred dollars on the camera , and I 'm well on my way to spending an equivalent amount on batteries . That 's absurd . I bought another brand of camera recently that uses standard AA batteries , and I 'm much happier with it . I use NiCads instead of the Li-Ions it came with , and they 're working great . Proprietary batteries s * ck .  
1	  I never got to install the connector into my PC . Since it was to be used to connect a second hard disk drive , space was going to be a factor . However , I ran into one unexpected difficulty . One end of the connector is at a right angle to the rest of the wire . It can only be installed one way into the hard drive . This would have the right angle positioning the cable up , and into the cover panel ; that is I could not put the cover back if I installed the cable 's right angle side into the hard drive . If I tried to install the right angle side on the motherboard connector , it was blocked by one of the small electronic parts on the motherboard , and would not connect . I purchased a cable with straight connectors on both ends and returned this connector to Amazon for a full refund . The new cable installed easily and works fine . I expect the original cable would have worked if it would have fit ; the difficulty was due to my mistake , or inexperience , in not being aware of the potential problem in the first place .  
1	  Purchased two separate units , both of which have failed in exactly the same way as detailed in the CNET discussion forms . Works for a few months , and then one day * poof * your data is no longer accessible . It 's not a coincidence - it 's a crappy , flawed product which is eventually going to have a class actions suit filed ( as evidenced by the Sklar lawfirm 's website and numerous discussion boards ) .  
2	  I bought this about 4 years ago , and have never had any real problem other than a paper jam occasionally . It was well worth the $ 80 I spent at Best Buy when it first was marketed . I 'm looking for an ink refill now , so I have faith it will last for some time .  
1	  There is no documentation of the fact that 64 bit Vista is not supported . This is my wife 's and I now have to run it over to my 32 bit Vista to synch it . Otherwise it 's a good machine ; but , of course , it 's obsolete now ..  
2	  The product I received was exactly as advertised online . The package also shipped quickly and arrived before I expected it .  
1	  This clock radio is actually a " Dream Machine " but it does not say that in the description . Dream Machine sounds very impressive but I think it is just something that was dreamed up by their marketing department . The reason that I bought this alarm clock was that it is advertized as having dual alarms . But you don't get two radio alarms you get a radio alarm and a buzzer alarm . I don't really like to be wakened to a buzzer and I use my clock radio to remind me about certain things going on around the house and I usually like just a radio to come on when that happens . And a lot of times I like to time more than one event at a time . So this radio is not as useful to me as it could be . A lot of the General Electric Clock Radios have dual alarms and for each one of the two you can choose if you want that alarm to be radio or buzzer . The time set feature is very good with a fast plus , a fast minus , and a slow plus . This is important because with some clock radios you can spend a lot of time setting the alarm time .  
1	  First , the quality of the image is horrible . It does support the S-Video , but the quality of output is even worse than the 8mm , not even close to Hi8 . I don't think my computer limits the performance . I am using P4 2.8G , with 512 MB ram . Second , the software provided has very limited function . It doesn't even has the split and combine function . Record audio track is impossible . With only a few effects to add on . Finally , the price is ok . DON'T EXPECT MUCH .  
2	  I use my IPOD to keep me company on my bike rides . I put the IPOD in my back shirt pocket , have this unit mounted to my handle bars and I can easily change volume , songs , etc . without having to fiddle with my IPOD . Highly recommended , especially for cyclists .  
1	  A nice system , very elegant design and performance .. no complaints there . A bit costly and the HD DVD Drive has seemingly buggy audio playback with HD Disks . For the price , as with most electronic devices , you expect some baked-in price for the customer service that comes with the package . On this piece ; you are throwing a fair percentage of that unit cost out the window . Have called TOSHIBA Customer Support 3 times on a single issue . System will not recognize the TV Tuner that is part of overall unit . Not a buy-up but ; sold as ' part of the package ' . I was transferred to " Level 2 " support 3 times , waited on hold for 20 minutes 3 times and was promised a " call-back " within 4 hours . That has taken place over five days since I received the computer one week back . To date ; nothing , no call back , no email . The last time I called , I mentioned that I was ready to return the system on a poor Customer Service basis alone . Same result ; no call back . It is a bit disheartening .  
1	  I have been using these strings for a while . I always went for them because they were the most expensive I could find and figured they were the best . Now I have been playing guitar for 8 years and I guess you could say why didn't you just stop buying them . Honestly , I would always just buy these guys and they last a long time but other than that they sound nothing like the D'Addario EXP16 that I just switched too . If you must buy these do not buy them at a medium gauge . They are way too rough and actually uncomfortable to play . There is a reason almost every guitar maker puts LIGHT d'addarios on their guitars . Trust me .  
2	  This case is very sturdy . Kinda big but sturdy enough to have confidence that your zune will be protected . Plenty of space for wires , cords , sleeves , etc .  
2	  I 've had my Visor Deluxe for only two weeks , and It 's already a vital part of how I keep my life organized . The graffiti writing was very easy to learn , there are only a few of the symbols that I am still trying to memorize . I tend to switch between graffiti writing and the keyboard , depending on how much writing . The HotSync does not work well when doing it between two visors . Sometimes it gets frozen when using two visor that are not compatible . For the Sync to work well , one should have both machines with the same amount of memory . The palm software was easy to load on to my Mac , and hotsyncing the information between Visor and Mac is a breeze .  
2	  The Vantec NexStar GX 3.5 USB External Hard Drive Enclosure is all that was advertised . Easy to install you hard drive and the built-in USB 2 . Hub is really a plus . Works really well and the internal fan helps to keep the Hard Drive cool .  
1	  The sound quality sucks even with the tweak ( that voids your warranty ) , Hissing , missing stereo . Come on CC Crane you guys should be able to do better than this ! Might be good for voice but poor sound even up close . Perhaps someone can tell us what the other screws do ( not the VR2 ) ? Save your money and look for something else unless CC crane can do a post and tell us how to get decent sound . I feel ripped off !  
1	  I must say that when it delivers the quality it is crystal clear and crisp but very frequently I see that its not able to keep up with the signal / reception and I see scrambled image .. sound goes and then comes back up and then the tv says weak or no signal .. and then I have to try again moving the antena .. try different combination and then may be if I am lucky it might work . In short if you are watching TV there is no peace of mind because every some minutes you will fear that the signal will be lost .  
2	  Apple 's iPod Nano is a great product , although not perfect : using its features is not always intuitive , but with some effort , one can master its functions . I especially like the automatic-update feature whenever it is connected to iTunes . I purchased a cheap MP3 player awhile ago and it is completely useless . It is gathering dust until I find the manufacturer and make him eat it . I recommend the iPod to any serious lover of music ( and audio books , photos , etc . ) .  
2	  I decided to get this 80GB iPod in order to store my CD collection . It seems that I will never run out of space in this iPod . The only problem I 've had so far is that sometimes it stops working for 3 up to 10 seconds , and then it starts working again . This only happens when turning the wheel around and when plugged into the monster cable in the car . I 'm pretty satisfied , though .  
2	  I have always bought Sony blank media and I have not had any problem with any products . All of these 50 DVD disc work great and none of these didn't work . Amazon offers the best price for these except other retail stores . I used all of these for data like photos and videos and I 've had no problem while burning or after . I was so satisfied I will buy more and I would recommend this to anyone who wants blank DVDs .  
1	  Totally not the same lens as the picture advertised ! Old version of mount can't even fit in my 2006 Nikon D300 . Original box unsealed . Dust and dirt found in the box . Instruction pocket opened . Good lens , but careless service messed up  
2	  This item works well . We were hoping each mailbox could have it 's own greeting but will work with just the two greetings  
2	  I just purchased this item and have not had any problems with it locking up . I loaded 55 pictures into the internal memory and it says that I can load 17 more . Each of my photos is 1.5m to 2m taken with a 4 mega pixal camera . When I purchased this I didn't realize that it had any internal memory and thought that it simply ran off a memory card . This does appear to be possible as well . Although the first time I inserted a memory card , it just started loading pictures into memory , the next time I put in the memory card ( with new pictures ) it started running the slide show directly from the card . I had to select and download the pictures from the card and then remove the card to run from the internal memory . Image quality is very good , maybe not as crisp as a 4x6 print by very close . As others have stated , the frame does stand very upright , I didn't think that this impacted the ability to view the image clearly .  
1	  There is a bug in this router that does not allow you to override the DNS servers provided by your ISP . The function is there in set up ; it just doesn't work . If you disable accepting the DNS from your ISP and enter your own primary backup DNS servers , it keeps the primary and secondary from your ISP and adds the primary you entered as a third , ignoring the secondary you entered . Tech support conceded that " this is the way the function works . " ' Doesn't work ' would be more accurate . If you like to use a DNS service like OpenDNS ( something everyone should consider ) , skip this router .  
2	  The machine is duable and photo printing is beyond my expectation . Fast print especially like the setting machanism which does not require a PC software . No USB cable is the negative . I cause me dig all my treasure box to find one to fit the system . I do not think average person can have such luck . You might spend another $ 8 and a trip to Best Buy .  
2	  OEM Epson inks are the right product for your inkjet Epson printer , as long as you care about things like color fidelity . Of course , that 's equally true if you use a different brand of printer . if you use lasers * and * dont care about color fidelity , you have more options . this seller provided current , legitimate Epson ink at a good price . thanks !  
2	  I 'm considering having my old ipod fixed . It was great for a few years .  
2	  a bit pricey - but it DOES work very well > Quality Video .. Great Features , Easy to follow software .. very rich color and sharp image . It is very easy to configure whether you want zooming or not etc  
2	  This is a great product but I really got ripped of in the shipping price .. a great idea to print pictures you take with your phone .  
1	  Well , where should I begin .. I needed to DIY my PC so I bought it . When I received the package ( together with my PC 's components ) , it seemed alright . There was only a small crack near the zipper , but who will pay real attention to such a small flaw on the outside , when you are in instant need of using the tools inside the bag ? Just before I fully opened the zipper , the tool kit bag popped open all of a sudden , and most of the tools fell down on the floor . It just seemed the designer did not give the tools enough space , and the they just hated to stay in the bag ! And I could hardly find a way to gracefully put everything back to the bag , because I even did not know where the tools originally were ! They fell out instantly when I opened the zipper before I could say Jack Robinson ! Now I found what the small crack was all about . The entire tool kit was made of POOR qualities . By saying POOR qualities I mean it REALLY sucks . Although the name of this tool kit indicates it is meant for computer assembly and repairing , but the screwdrivers in the tool kit are just RIDICULOUSLY LARGER THAN YOU NEED ! Even the screwdriver of the smallest size could not fit the largest screw on my PC ! Okay maybe you can still use the tool kit for repairing things other than a computer . Yes , maybe you can use the screwdrivers to help you assemble desk delivered from Walmart , and maybe you can install a doorbell on the wall for your apartment . But it is not convenient because the tips of the screwdrivers are NOT magnetic ! It may make sense that in order to protect your computer , especially the data on your hard drive , a computer tool kit being demagnetized is considerate . But it makes no sense in this case , because you CANNOT use this tool kit with a computer ! If you are making the screwdrivers too large for mending computers , PLEASE make the screwdrivers magnetized so that I can keep it for other purposes ! I just don't understand what this company is thinking .  
2	  Product quality is good .. is according to the price paid .. recommend this product is just what I needed .. all ok  
2	  I have gone through all types of transmitters from belkin to monster to bargaincell and crzondigital and thus far this coby transmitter has bn the best I have used thus far .. Not staticy , convinient to charge another device in my car and sound is clear .. couldnt have asked for more thank u ^ _ ^  
2	  I know others were saying they were having trouble crimping these , but with the correct tool , there is no problem . They are heavy duty when crimped on and will stay on much longer than the thinner brands  
1	  This product is very slow . It claims 30 + pages per minute , but first it needs to warm up for up to 2 minutes .. all while making loud noises as if its struggling . Color copies are not color-accurate .. even after tweaking the settings . Jams up-often .. atleast once a day . The only thing this is good for is a fancy paper-weight to make the office look impressive . Thats about it .  
1	  I purchases a product similar to this one and was involved in an accident where my head was whipped forward and I sustained serious injuries to my forehead and scalp when the CD 's sliced me like a knife along my forehead from ear to ear . My scalp was seperated from my skull all the way to the crown of my head . I was in surgery for several hours while they stitched my scalp back together . I also lost all feeling from the cut along my forehead to the crown of my skull due to the nerve endings being ripped from the scalp . It has been over a year since the accident and I still have no feeling on my head . I urge everyone to think twice before purchasing any type of CD holder that wraps around your car visor .  
1	  Bought this because I was lead to believe a ' linear ' polarizer was part of a multi-lens kit . You get ONE UV filter . Not a bad deal if you want a UV filter-but I wanted the ' linear ' polarizer . Not worth the effort to send back , will keep as a ' spare ' I ordered a ' linear polarizer ' directly from Adorama .  
2	  This is an amazing product , the sound is clear and with high quality . I 'm really impressed with that . It looks beautiful , its design is cool . The additional charging system allows you charge your phone and listen your music at the same time .. Excellent !  
1	  I bought this for FinePix S5PRO camera by Fujifilm . S5PRO has the same body as Nikon D-200 . This flash simply did not synchronize with the camera - that is , the flash did not even go off at all . I returned it and 47th Street camera store quickly refunded the money after 15 % restocking fee .  
1	  If you 're thinking this looks like a good buy for 14 gauge wire , be aware that this is copper-coated wire , not full braided copper ! I would much rather direct you to Monoprice where you can get pure copper 12 guage wire for roughly the same price . Do not buy this wire !  
2	  Once again , Amazon has done a great job to help me find a unique gift for my staff . I needed 6 of the same gift , suitable for men and women , in time for Christmas . The folks loved their binoculars and everything arrived promptly and safely . Thanks again .  
2	  There is little I can say . I recived it quickly in 2 days of ordering it . I am very happy with my magnifier . It is not Glass , and I wish it had a sleeve to keep it from getting any stray dust on it . However I just use a soft glass cloth that came with my Camera , and so it 's also easy to keep clean . The handle was a little light , so it is not heavy duty . Overall however it was a good buy , I can read again now .  
1	  Unlike thier sound cards , creative labs rests onl thier lawrals ( you can tell by the snotty customer service with faked forein accents when ordering replacement items ) on most other equipment , which is not more than peddled trash outside a " flee market " at best , this includes speakers , speaker stands and these " gameing " devices . Like Microsoft 's hardware what you get is an enormously expensive peice of trash that lasts six months at best . How can ANYONE except paying this much for ANYTHING and only expect it to last SIX MONTHS ! Customers should raise thier standards instead of thinking about " patronage " . The name printed on this is a gimmick , this guy does not indorse this pile ( or does so absently and uncaring of how good it is in a game ) . If you want good input devices I suggest Saitek all the way for everything . ( except maybe the throttle crap ) . Thier software sux but thier devices are solid as a rock and quite beautiful to boot !  
1	  I also recieved the wrong motherboard .. twice . Instead of fixing the problem and sending me the correct board ( as advertised ) they cancelled my order , gave me back my money and told me to go look someplace else for it . Not good sales practice  
2	  Got this to use with XBOX 360 so I could listen to the surround sound audio while playing games ( this was before I had an HDTV so HDMI wasn't an option at the time and I had the older XBOX 360 w / out HDMI out ) . The 12 ft length is great .. makes component placement a breeze because I know I will always have enough cable to easily reach my receiver . The cable feels well made but is still flexible enough to be practical but I wouldn't make 90 degree bends with it ( or with any cable for that matter ) though ! Just an FYI : this cable can transfer 6 channels of audio . 5 for the surround sound plus 1 for the subwoofer . The two main formats are DTS and Dolby Digital . Both of these formats are discrete ( separate ) 5.1 surround sound meaning that each speaker has its own audio channel . The newer Blu-ray lossless formats are higher quality version and cannot be transmitted through this cable . NOTE : A " Surround Sound " System isn't surround sound just because it comes with a lot of speakers ! You need the receiver to be getting audio digital audio ( encoded in a surround format ) for the receiver to play true surround sound .. The standard red and white RCA cables will not do it .. ( I know there are some analog fans out there that run 5.1 or even 7.1 with their SACD or DVD Audio or Blu-ray players via multi-channel RCA 's .. but you guys are about 1 % of the population .. AND if you are a die-hard analog fan , you probably aren't reading this review haha . You can also run discrete surround sound from a computer via analog cables and a nice sound card .. but most nice sound cards also offer digital output .. or an extra piece you can buy that adds digital output ! ) If for some reason you need to use this cable with your Blu-ray player / receiver it will work with Blu-ray discs .. it just uses the older DTS or Dolby Digital format rather than the DTS Master Audio or the Dolby True HD formats . It will still be surround sound and will still sound good .. just not as good as the loss-less formats . ANYWAY , if you need to hook up surround sound and don't need / don't have an HDMI cable , this will work ! There is no difference between the optical cables vs . the digital coax .. it just depends on what technology the equipment manufacturer chose to use . Some people will argue that the optical cable is better for longer runs ( 50 + ft ) but I doubt it / who has 50 ft cable runs ? Also , the protective covers for the ends are great when the cable is not in use .  
1	  I originally rated this as a good lens , but it just stopped focusing on auto after a year of using it . Really disappointed . It served me well until now but will never buy it again because it is obviously poorly made . I 've had my 24-70mm for several years without any problems .  
2	  I drive alot for work and pleasure and have used maps and map quest for years and thought I was pretty good at getting around . Not . This makes life much easier especially when in areas that I don't usually drive to very often . Works great and you can mute the voice that tells you that she is recalculating if you get off course . As much as I might hate to admit it this is a great time saving device .  
2	  the install depends of your hardware and s . o . i have win2k and motherboard intel so it was easy . you can use this card in many ways : i use for games and sounds very well . i download midi secuences and play midis using the soundfonts , i record it at wav format then i burn it at cd-audio and sounds very well . i play some times dvd-audio discs the output is analog no digital , ( all dvd-audio players are analog output ) ok , four stars because : Strengths : DVD-Audio , Dolby digital EX , many inputs and outputs , EAX , Remote control , support soundfonts last version . 2 games and music software , THX Certification . Weaknesses : no SACD , no DTS-ES or DTS , problems with some motherboards  
1	  I purchased a Palm TX in Nov 2008 and an extended warranty from N.E.W. Unfortunately , despite my hardcase , my screen cracked when I dropped it . I called N.E.W. , was told the cracked screen was covered under my policy , and was promised a return label would be emailed to me . The next day , I had not received it , and I emailed customer service ; however , I did not receive a response . On the third day , I called again . I was informed my file could not be accessed without my contract number , even when I not only told him it had been accessed two days prior without the contract number , but also gave the case number I had been assigned that day . At one point , he even asked me why my name field was blank on his screen . Of course , I had to point out I had no idea since I did not work for his organization . I finally asked to speak with a supervisor . His exact words to me were " She is going to tell you the same thing I am . " Despite this inane remark , I again asked to speak with a supervisor . Although this employee did at least appear to be competent , she informed me the first employee I spoke with who had told me the Palm would be repaired under the policy was incorrect . When I asked exactly what was covered by the policy , she responded only the electronics if it suddenly stopped working . I told her of my past few days of experience with N.E.W. When asked for the names of the people with whom I had talked , I told her I assumed an organization of the size of N.E.W. tracked that information on their computer system . In fact , she not only knew the names of the 2 people besides herself with whom I had spoken , but she saw the email correspondence which was never answered . Finally , I told the supervisor I could understand why N.E.W has such low ratings on Amazon . DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR MONEY . They are incompetent . Amazon needs to quit selling such a poor product .  
1	  I bought one of these cute little players because of the recommendations off another MP3 site . When it arrived , the first thing I found out was that it wasn't that little or that cute . it looked more like a pager from 1982 . After 6 attempt at installing the software on my desktop computer I gave up and managed to install it on the laptop instead . That didn't help much in downloading songs to the player , it hung on the second song download every time . I had to buy an adapter for the CF card so that I could download songs directly to the card . Once I did get a few songs on the player its sound was OK , but no better than he Genoa MP3 CD I bought laster year . The last straw happened a few days later . I had attached the eGo to my belt while out running errands . I tuned the player off while I picking up a few items in a drugstore . On leaving the store I went to start the eGo but it wouldn't play . Due to a moronic design flaw , the Ego 's card slot is open and on the bottom of the player so when it was attached to the belt clip the CF card had fallen out and was lost . I gave the player one last shot and tried 2 of the 128mb cards I use for my digital camera but neither would play in the eGo . Apparently , the devise only support a very limited number of cards on the market . The only help I got from the company in response to several email about the software problems was , " Did you read our web site ? " My advise to you is find a player with a little more thought behind it .  
1	  I purchased this exact model . Never again . I had problems from the beginning . It worked ok for a while , then started making noises . Eventually , it stopped working altogether . Total drive failure . Techsupport is impossible . Dead links for tech or customer service . Waiting on the phone for 40 minutes only to be disconnected . I finally got an RMA to retrun the product . I paid $ 30 for fedex shipment , only to recieve the product , unfixed a week and a half later . No explanation . No reply . No paperwork . And still no satisfaction or reply from the company . Stay away .. stay very far away  
2	  Worked fine to transfer all data from the hard drive before sending my laptop in for repairs . I didn't need to go through driver installation procedures on the enclosed disk , just plugged it in and it was ready to go .  
2	  Its getting real boring say the same thing over and over . First rate on service and first rate on quality .  
1	  Built better than some , but disappointed . This blows air UP under laptop , not suck hot air OUT from under and away in back . Not as effective as some less expensive .  
2	  The delivery was afst and the software is easy to use . I am very happy with this purchase .  
2	  I have to give the device 5 stars . I 've had palm hand-helds before and this one is very good , light weight and has an excellent display . However the software included is not compatible with Vista . It appeared to load , but nothing would sync . I e-mailed technical support back and forth for a long time . The tech never could figure out what the problem was , I even asked him if it could be a Vista problem and he didn't know . I finally googled " Palm desktop for Vista " and found out that the software has to be downloaded from the palm website . The download took over an hour , then the information was zipped and I had to buy Winzip in order to unpack it to send to my computer . I was almost ready to return the device for a refund , but I had spent so much time trying to get it to work that I didn't want to feel as though I had wasted my time and effort . So if you have a Vista operating system , you can still use this device with your computer , but don't waste your time with the software included in the package . Go directly to the internet and get the software from the website .  
1	  This was actually a pretty nice product . At the original price it was a real deal a few years ago . Unfortunately , there have been no upgrades to the drivers . This means no Vista or Windows 7 support . Also consider that special software needs to be installed on all computers that wish to access this device . Otherwise , it will NOT be accessible by that computer . So , unless you are an old-time hacker who will keep all his network in XP , stay away .  
2	  simply attach to key chain its always with you how much more convenient is this  
1	  I purchased this battery after triple checking that it was for my computer model . It wasn't and I was stuck with paying to have it replaced . It is better to eat the higher price and go through the vendor ( Toshiba 's ) website . It will save you money and aggravation in the end .  
2	  I recently bought this machine and to me it performs just fine . The digital sound quality is good and it 's very easy to program and use . I would certainly recommend this machine to anyone in the market for one . For the inexpensive price , mine works as well or better than some more expensive ones I 've had in the past .  
1	  One of the channels went out at the end of the boating season . In all , lasted 4 months and now is essentially junk . I may of gotten a bad one , but didn't do the job .  
2	  This Logitech keyboard / mouse combo is an excellent buy . In addition to all the regular keys , this keyboard also has enhanced ' F ' keys that are pre-programmed to do a number of different tasks like open Word , Excel , and Powerpoint . There are also ' Undo ' , ' Redo ' , ' Print ' and ' Save ' keys . there are also 4 user-programmable keys . To the left of the ' Caps Lock ' key are a ' Back ' and ' Close Window ' keys to control your browser . It took me a while to get used to these , but now I like them . The mouse is nothing fancy : your basic 3-button variety , with the middle button being a scroll wheel . The best thing about these devices is the lack of wires to clutter up the desk / restrain free motion of the mouse .  
2	  I 'm no audiophile , but I did a lot of research , and for the price Amazon is offering these speakers , they are hard to beat . The material quality is good ( again , especially considering the price point ) . Shipping was free and I had the speakers in four days . Set-up was easy ( they 're speakers , after all ) and they sound quite good . In the various reviews I have read , some complain that these speakers need a sub woofer , as they don't have enough bass . For normal listening , they strike me as just fine . The Monitor 60 and 70 add more drivers and thus more bass , and also more dollars to the price .  
2	  Nice addition for the DVD camera I purchased . Having the extra battery is a real plus .  
1	  After two months it just keeps overheating ! Filter is clean but constantly shuts off . I have very short thin hair and this hair dryer has to cool down at a minimum of three times before I can dry my hair . Not very powerful , a waist of money and another item sent to the land fill .  
1	  I bought a new card and it failed in just a couple of days . From literature review it appears that this card has known issues with Axim PDA 's and other devices . I contacted San Disk customer service and I am yet to hear from them . Stay away from this junk .  
1	  bought 2 of this kind one of another none of the 3 worked but on one side , tried to re-route wires but to no avail , I just wanta a splitter to work on both sides , Greywolfesc  
1	  I ordered this rewinder because the idea of it made sense . Why let my camera do the grunt-work ? The maxell wasn't the cheapest , but still pretty cheap , and even tho the reviews were not favorable , I tend to have good luck with stuff so I figured , why not me ? And I could save $ 30 over the more expensive rewinders . Upon attempting to use it , I experienced exactly what some other customers experienced : the " rewind " button stuck down , the thing tried to eat my tape , and it never did anything remotely electrical besides niftily remove about $ 17 from my wallet . If you think you need one of these , send me your $ 17 and I 'll send you a CD I don't like instead . Your chances of being pleased with your purchase is much higher .  
2	  At the current going prices where you can pick a unit up for around $ 825 from H / K refurb , or if you are very lucky even more cheaper from Fry 's electronics , this unit is amazing . I am one of the lucky few who got the display unit from Fry 's . The Display unit had the front door broken ( no biggie ) , and came with nothing but the unit . Before this unit , I had the Onkyo 605 which came with all the bells and whistles . Now , the 605 is a low mid range unit , so it is not a apples to apples comparison , but the 745 was * noticeably * better in audio . Sound quality can be subjective , but when playing the 745 , even not too loud , you can hear the various instruments distinctly . My wife ( professional musician ) , indicated that see could hear the 4 instruments being played softly on this unit , but not on the onkyo . I have it connected to HD-A3 , and it does a great job with movies also . It has a whole lot of inputs you can use in optical and coax and 2 HDMI . Now , this unit has a few nuances , but if SQ is what you seek , look no further .  
1	  I 've had this printer for about nine month , and have purchased ink three times . A few months ago I received a court letter regarding a class action lawsuit against epson . The plaitiffs alleged that inkjet printers and inkjet cartridges indicate that cartridges are " empty " and suspended printer function ' eventhough substantial ink remains . This case has now been setteled . After spending alot of money on ink . I decided to purchase another printer istead ( an 89.00 $ canon ) and , Im now printing my pictures at target . If you Buy this or any other epson be prepared to spend a few extra bucks on ink . Oh by the way , each color cartidge cost me 14 or 15 dollars , six colors in total .  
1	  This wasn't the monitor we registered for , but the one we wanted wasn't in stock . We thought this might be of similar quality but we were sorely mistaken . All we usually get is static . Second , it has a loud buzz sound it makes when it isn't picking up static . It does have a night light effect that lasts for a few minutes when you turn it on or just touch the button . It also picks up sound good , you just have to listen over the static or look at the red light indicator to tell if the baby is stirring . We are looking for another monitor because that annoying buzz keeps me up at night .  
2	  I bougth this laptop because I think Toshiba ia a brand to wokr hard in laptops and I 'm rigth with this laptop . If you want to work hard and have a high movility , this is a very good choice at a very good price .  
1	  above says it all , hours on the phone and on line . i think the radio part must be dead buthow do you tell or prove it ? too late to return . i won't buy any more ' netgear ' brand . as they say your milage may vary .  
2	  It is better now that it is smaller . Apple made a wise decision to include the USB cable instaed of having to buy a seperate one for twenty bucks . It is also very helpful because it charges the iPod way faster that through your computer .  
2	  I purchased this Acer monitor for my MacBook so I had to get a mini-DVI to DVI adaptor which was not a problem . The product description does not mention it comes with both a DVI and VGA cable . It is actually 1680 x 1050 though the title says 1600 . When I purchased a couple of days ago ( February 17 , 2008 ) it was sold through Amazon and had free shipping but for some reason I see now it is sold through another vendor that is charging shipping but the price is still good . I paid $ 199 total . When you look in the manuals that come with it there is about a page and a half of instructions , though the manuals are larger because of all the different languages . It it so easy to set up and use , nothing more is required . It is nice to open a product and just plug it in and have it work great right off the bat . The picture of the item on Amazon seems to make it look like it has a white or gray frame even though it is listed as black . It is all black . And with my white MacBook including white wireless keyboard and mouse , it is fine . The black front frame just make the image that more intense . I am happy with this purchase . It even has a 3 year warranty which is pretty impressive for any items and especially a computer item .  
2	  First used this product at a hotel in Vegas . Bought one for home and love it . Leaves hair smooth and retractable cord makes for easy storage .  
1	  After what I thought was careful comparison between the various models , I selected what I thought was the LITEON model with LIGHT SCRIBE labeling . Either myself or Amazon made the mistake - not sure - ( only $ 2 difference and very similar model numbers ) . Either way , I wound up without the LIGHT SCRIBE feature . I want to stress that there are reviews under THIS MODEL that talk about LIGHT SCRIBE . This model DOES NOT include that feature . Be very careful if you want that feature to get the model that includes it - and read your conformation email carefully !  
1	  as all above have stated , i am severely disappointed in this unit for one reason only .. the hiss . it is " not that bad " , but it is totally unacceptable for a product of this price . even $ 5 walmart clock radios don't have amplifier hiss . its completely unacceptable . i would give the product 4 stars without the hiss . the controls are silly and confusing . buttons have 2-3 different operations depending on audio source and they are not intuitive . the product is convienent as heck , yet i would not pay over $ 50 for it again . build quality is cheap and chincy . there 's not even a solid plastic handle ( the supplied nylon strap really doesn't get it done ) . the ipod integration is pretty cool , and this dock is one of the only to actually charge the ipod . sound quality is sub-par at best . again , for a product of this price , i expect much more . the mid and high range is muddy and tinny . not crisp or clean at all . the subwoofers clip and distort with a lot of volume . the sad thing is , you 're not going to find a product with these features for under $ 250 . amazing idea .. price is right .. but the execution was pathetic .  
1	  I got this mouse because the wire on the mouse that came w / my laptop was a little too short to reach throught the wire manager at the back of my desk & back up to the keyboard tray . Unfortuantely this mouse can't seem to get decent reception at this distanc . The straightline distance is 3 to 4 feet , with the desk surface in between . The performance is exceedingly choppy ( useless ) . The mouse works OK when I move it up onto the desk , but if I wanted it this close I wouldn't need a wireless mouse . I might use it when travelling , but it is worthless in my office .  
2	  Recently , I tried to save money by buying off-brand ink tanks . Never again ! One leaked and the other ran out in record time . I 've learned that paying a little more for the printer manufacturer 's ink is cheaper in the long run . After all , they design the printer to work best with their ink , so why take chances ?  
2	  I noticed these elevation feet are cheaper for mac version than pc version . Since they looked the same I went with the cheaper mac feet for my Alienware m17x . Here are the pros and cons : pros : 1 . Its straight forward to apply . Peel and stick2 . It does amazing job of keeping my laptop cool . My fans are working less because my laptop is venting very well . 3 . Very sleek and slim when folded down . For those that are not familiar with the Alienware m17x , its a beast of a computer in weight and size . I had to cut my laptop bag ( biggest laptop bag from bags . com ) with scissors to get my laptop to slide in . I was concerned adding these feet would make it worse . I was very pleasantly surprised when everything folded down and was able to fit in without a problem . Its elegant looking . 4 . Beefy . If this can survive 2years supporting the m17x , it will probably have no problem supporting any other laptop . cons : 1 . Matter of time until adhesive backing starts peeling off . But then again my laptop weighs like 15lbs . This can be fixed easily by using silicone . 2 . The rubber friction pad will eventually fall off . Again easy fix , just glue it back in . 3 . I should have paid extra for the black feet since white feet don't look good on the jet black alienware . How does one spend $ 5k on a laptop but cheaps out on little elevation feet ? .. I 'm shaking my head .  
1	  I had similar products of these FM transmitters from 5 years ago . It was filled with static back then . I thought the technology surely would have improved since 5 years ago but I was disappointed once again . My suggestion , spend your money on other accessories .  
2	  this mouse is very smooth with high rez of 800dpi , nice feel for a smaller mouse , which is what I like . the sides bowing inwards makes the mouse very pleasent to grip with your thumb . The cord is longer then most notebook mice which is great for me because I use it for a desktop , it is at least 3ft maybe more . The mouse 's build is very good . it feels nicly solid and has extra support around the cord so it is less likly to die of a problem with the cord , as I 've had other small mice and their cords have not lasted . I 'm very happy with this attractive , well built , & simple mouse . I guess the only thing I might add is another button but then it wouldn't be all that simple would it ?  
1	  I purchased two of these copiers at the same time . one works fine . The other has a paper jam sensor bad . Warranty work has to be brought in to the repair facility that is 39 miles away through heavy traffic . Or else I have to pay the freight to and from the facility . This seems wrong when it comes out of the box not working . Amazon 's warranty says it can be returned if the box is not opened . How can you check to see if it is working without opening the box ? I will most likley not buy from Amazon for any product that is a working piece of equipment . I will not recommend to anyone of my 1500 + clients to buy from Amazon .  
2	  The keyboard works well . The combined weight of the keyboard and my Palm Tungsten is much less than that of a netbook , a feature that was very important to me .  
2	  The Service speed . the Product both 10Stars . I love that the screen protector isent a sticker .  
2	  I 've run past my warrantee period for about two months now and the drive is still running . I was a bit bothered initially by too many people having problems . Maxtor obviously had a bad batch come out of the plant but mine wasn't one of the . Now that I trust the drive I can recommend it fully . As 500 gigabytes is still a pretty good capacity and the price has dropped , I 'll probably get this same drive . It has a solid and attractive case . The drive is almost silent , which is very important to me . It has both Firewire and USB connections . My old iBook needs Firewire for a bootable backup . My newer iMac needs USB . I partitioned the Maxtor so it can back up both of them . I have another drive the same size a Seagate that runs fine but looks decidedly cheap next to the Maxtor , which has a rubber or silicone coated metal enclosure . The case doesn't slide around , and doesn't need a cheesy clip on stand that won't stay attached . I switch drives every week between office and home so have two copies of everything . Maybe that 's why my drives don't break . They must know that one bad drive can't ruin my life . The Maxtor came both a USB and a Firewire cable . The Seagate only came with USB . The Maxtor cables were both 6 ft . long . The Seagate USB was 4 ft , not quite long enough to reach from my iMac to the shelf I want to put the backup drive on . The Maxtor cable ended up at the office replacing the shorter one . The Seagate works but when I get my next drive I 'll look to another brand . Another nice touch is the one touch backup . Install the software . Set the options and I could back up by just pushing the button on the front of the drive . It 's a nice extra . If I didn't already have a solution I like , that alone , would have recommended the Maxtor over its competitors .  
2	  I like the earbuds so much that I replace my previous original IPOD earbuds . Its pink color bright up my spirit easily . Sound quality is decent too . Two cons : 1 . the silcon parts sometimes fall off , tough to find them . 2 . after half a year since I used it , one earbud does not sound any more . :(  
2	  Having lived with this drive for about a month , my biggest impression is that I dont have one . That is good for a disk drive . The drive installed easily enough ( I got it for firewire but ended up using the USB 2.0 connections since I think my firewire network has some problems , based on errors I have gotten on my other drives . So the versatility of both connections is nice ) . It is quiet , and seems to be as fast as anything else I have . The only negative is it is thicker than my 250G drives , so it doesnt fit exactly in the same space as the drive it replaced . I will probably need to buy another large drive and I would not hesitate in getting another Maxtor Onetouch II .  
2	  I bought PDR-M25 and have been using it for the last 4 months . I am very happy that I made this purchase and it 's really proved it 's worth . It 's got no fancy features and so very decently priced . I wouldn't be using most of the features that are provided with the higher priced cameras anyways . A truly worthy deal ..  
2	  I wanted an MP3 player for the car to use cheap disposable discsin . I got that and more . Very nice . The only complaint is it doesnot recognise I turned off the engine and automatically power-off , but this is only a very minor thing . Excellent !  
1	  Most all iPods do not support fireWire transfers . It will only charge your iPod ; nothing else . You won't be able to transfer songs or use your iPod in disk mode . I just wasted about 10 bucks to be disappointed !  
2	  I bought these for outdoor use and paired them with the lepai 2020 amp . I was expecting just to get " sound " out of these and nothing special . I am amazed at how full the sound is that these produce . The only downfall is the tweeter material and terminals are a little cheap looking . but you had to cut cost somewhere . I would expect the tweeter to be the first thing to go on these . But if they last me a few years outdoors for the price I have no complaints . If your looking for inexpensive outdoor speakers these are the way to go .  
2	  i have few collapsible diffusers / backgrounds and by far this kit is the best quality wise . Its very handy on locations and in studio , and i couldnt even imagine how hard my life would be without it .  
2	  * Updated , since we 've gone another year of heavy usage with this TV , and it 's still as good as the day we bought it . We leave it on in the evenings , whether or not we 're watching it ( I like the background noise , and news ) , so we 're probably going on 5,000 hours . For those of you who have had the " popping " problem , it would help the rest of us owners ( whose TVs are still fine after well over 2 years ) to know :( a ) What was the manufacture date of your TV ? ( b ) When did you buy the TV ? ( c ) What time of year ( month / season ) did it " pop " ? ( d ) What is your setup ? Wall-mount ? Stand ? ( e ) Is the area behind the TV well ventilated ? * The previous few questions are only because plasma TVs use a lot of power , and of course will run hot ( just feel the back after a couple hours ) . One of the number 1 rules to owning a plasma is to use it in a VERY well ventilated area . ( f ) What were your TV settings most of the time ? Brightness / Contrast ? Low / Regular power ? Did you lower the settings for the first 200 hours as recommended for all plasmas ? ( g ) How many hours a day did you typically run the TV ? I only suggest that people update their reviews with more info , because it might make a difference as to how the owners of working sets continue with their current setup . If it turns out many of the " poppers " were hung on the wall in a room with no venilation behind it , or right up against a wall , or anywhere near a heater / vent , or left on for several hours at a time - that 's going to make a huge difference , and it might help others preserve their TVs , saving from the same outcome . The average owner might not be aware of the proper care and setup of their plasma , which could lead to some ( of course not all ) of the unhappy buyers of this TV . Just a thought . Even if it dies , we had some good times .  
2	  ` For most internet service providers , all you have to do is plug it between your cable or DSL modem and your PC and its ready . ` I currently have only one machine using a cable modem connection and chose this router as a hardware firewall - with a view to future networking . My service provider , however , is a bit more protective about potential sharing of a connection than most . Even so , one phone call to a very helpful member of Linksys tech support had the system running perfectly . ` Can't ask better of the router or the company . I recommend this product specifically and Linksys generally .  
1	  I bought this unit about a year ago using it as a home theater system . The sound is ok , but after a few month 's use the dvd cd door jammed rendering play back inoperable . I mainly use it now as a radio / receiver for another Phillips multi region dvd player connected to my hdtv . It functions ok for that . Another case of form over substance - it looks nice but was a waste of money . Now in the market for a decent reciever with out the extra dvd / cd included .  
2	  I purchased a couple of these and they seem to work fine even after while . The reason I replaced the other battery is that my sisters phones were making a strange noise and apparently it was not the batteries fault because these are working just fine  
2	  Overall this package is well worth it . The mouse and keyboard look great and are very well designed . I will never switch back to corded anything on my desktop . they work well from about 10 feet away . Negatives :* the keyboard doesn't react instantly . As another reviewer said , there is a slight but noticeable delay between the time you push a key and the time the letter appears onscreen . I got used to it . * the programmable buttons on the keyboard are useful , but often don't work . this * the mouse turns itself off after a few seconds of non-use to save battery . the problem is that rolling the scroll wheel does not wake wake the mouse back up . you have to move the mouse side to side to use the scroll wheel . annoying when you 're reading a long document .  
2	  If Archos , the company , had competent management , its products would be world class . Unfortunately , the company 's management is not overly competent , so it turns out near exellent to excellent products that take a clobbering in the marketplace . The Archos 605 160 GB is a superb product , but its introduction was marred by lack of availability which created a lot of ill will among people who very much wanted it . Wait times of three or more months were not uncommon - and the company remained silent . Truly a stupid thing to do . Even now , months after release , promised accessories are still not available - and Archos simply doesn't communicate with its customers . If you read the Archos support forums on the web , you also get the impression that Archos customer support stinks as well . Given all that , I am very pleased with the Archos 605 . The Archos 605 160 GB is everything you 'd want in a personal multimedia player . The 160 GB hard drive will hold up to 200 feature length movies at acceptable resolution or more hours of music than you could listen to . The screen is superb . 4.3 " at 800x480 resolution is large enough to display most movies that don't go overboard on dark , moody scenes . Almost all common formats are supported out of the box . Playback is flawlessly smooth . Navigating the touchscreen is simple . The side mounted buttons are very convenient for controlling most functions . A major improvement is the inclusion of a volume button . The front mounted speaker is surprisingly sufficient , especially compared to the Archos 504 . Headphone volume and fidelity is more than sufficient . I use the Archos 605 primarily for video playback and think it is faultless ; much better than the 5G iPod with video . Yes , it is physically larger , but it is far better suited to the purpose than the iPod . The screen is acres larger than the iPod - at least it seems that way when you are watching a video . The speaker is very nice and something the iPod doesn't have . A little kickstand lets you set the unit on a table to watch . Way cool . Music seems to work well , handling a number of formats and being accessible without the need for special software like iTunes . Just drag and drop . I haven't yet tried creating playlists . Some people have commented that it is a chore . As a photo viewer , it has some cool features . Just drag left or right to get to the next or previous picture . Drag up or down and the photo rotates . You can zoom the image from a sidebar and navigate with your finger . Cool . And , again , the screen is stunning . There 's also a file manager which comes in handy if you use the Archos as removable storage for your PC . It functions just like any other USB removable hard drive . One of the other unsavory aspects of Archos management is that they are as chintzy as Apple . For example , you don't get an AC adapter with this almost $ 400 device . You get a USB cable which you can use to charge the device - and which takes forever . A number of other features are add-ons as well . Though the Archos is WiFi enabled , they charge extra for the Opera browser , which is more than adequate for handling Flash videos . They also charge extra for plug-ins to access H. 264 and MPEG-2 formats . The argument is that Archos doesn't want to charge people for features they don't want . Uh , considering what it would cost Archos to bundle these features , I think the motive is pure greed . ( A PDF viewer comes standard . ) Then there are the docks . You can get one to make the Archos into a DVR . Actually you can get one for stationary use or another for travel . There 's another dock to that permits you to download pictures from your digital camera . And another that has a backup battery . Overall , the Archos has the potential of taking a bunch of bucks out of your pocket . But when it comes to a platform for viewing video or photos , browsing the web wirelessly and listening to music , the Archos 605 is in a league of its own . Jerry  
1	  This product has been a nightmare . I bought it a year ago when I got my Olympus C2100UZ digital camera . Since then , I 've had the following problems : 1 . When windows says it 's done copying files , i remove the card only to find a read-write error that it wasn't complete after all . 2 . Copy errors ( files not accessable ) when copying data to my CF card for use in my Pocket PC . 3 . EUSBMSD . SYS file ( used for this card reader ) would hard crash my system when playing games ( Dark age of camelot ) or using my cd-burning software ( NERO ) . 4 . Their " winXP certified drivers " don't do anything . It 's the same problems . 5 . Had two cards of holiday pictures . Inserted card A and copied all files off . Then deleted the pics off the card . Inserted card B , and found that there were no pictures ! Inserted Card A again , and the pictures that I DELETED were still there ! So now i 'm out 148 pictures thanks to this defective product . Avoid this at all costs , i 'm sure there are better , more reliable readers out there .  
2	  Got them on time and they work exactly as expected . Would order them again if I need more cables . :-)  
2	  The shuffle is a nifty little gadget all it 's own , but add this armband to the mix and you are ready for a workout ! It 's a perfect accessory to the shuffle , very lightweight , functional , you hardly know it 's there ! 5 stars !  
1	  After purchasing thier 4-port DSL router , which I really like , I thought I 'd give Linksys another try with the WAP11 . I wish now I hadn't . The product shipped with only 40 ( 64 ) bit WEP encryption , which was a surprise to me since most everything has moved to 128bit encryption . No problems , Linksys had a firmware upgrade which offered the 128 , so I downloaded it and installed it . Then my problems began . The firmware install utility reported it did not complete properly , and subsequent tries failed completely . When I tried to access the WAP11 with the SNMP tool , it failed . I then tried the USB interface tool , which worked , and the unit appeared to have upgraded properly despite the report from the utility . ( I have since discovered many other people had the same problem in upgrading the fw . Did Linksys even test this ? ) After waiting forever on Linksys ' tech support queue , I was greeted with a tech support person , who as I suspected , knows less about networking than I do , and appeared to know even less than me about Linksys products . He sent me begrudgingly down a few blind alleys , which I informed him were not the solution , only to find out I was right . Oh .. the reason I called tech support ? It was to get the SNMP utility to work , which is the only way to limit the MAC addresses . The solution ? Disable the password access to the WAP . Brilliant huh ! Anyways since then , the unit is working , however anytime I am transfering large amounts of data , the WAP will lock up , pretty consistently too . Then it must be power-cycled to work again . I think I 'll be returning this unit and try another brand .  
1	  Attached new monitor with this cable . Picture was ' snowy ' . Got cable because is was not ' long ' . Attached longer cable , picture perfect . Forget about considering this cable .  
1	  Indicator lights worked fine , but no sound . I 'm sending it back .  
2	  It works perfectly . I have had no problems with this product . I had bought 2 diffrent ones at Wal-mart and both of them broke .  
2	  Great piece of technology for an industry still groping for standards . Hard drive allows you to perform acrobatics with the DVD recorder . One of my favorite features - the commercial zapper . Improvements needed : the remote needs to be able to " learn " new functions . Big pain to transfer all of this machines functions onto another remote . Also , the machine does not control the cable box ( more the cable company 's fault ) . You need to program the cable box yourself to switch channels when you are away .  
2	  The ease of using the interface of this camera is beyond any other competitors . Almost all settings can be done with the dials , meaning to say that you don't have to sieve through tons of menus on the LCD to change a setting . The LCD is a big bonus as well . It really makes me wonder why Nikon and Canon can't do the same , it 's not technically challenging nor does it increase cost by much . Trust me , you 'll love the 7D once you compare it 's LCD to the puny ones that others offer . Battery life is adequate as well . Obviously the Anti-shake is an advantage , especially if you have shakey hands to begin with . But take note that it 's not a miracle cure , it REDUCES shake , but doesn't ALWAYS eliminate it . So at the end of the day , you still require rather steady hands . A few gripes . Firstly , there 's not much lens selection . You can't beat the likes of canon 's vast collection . But Minolta is rectifying that , so its not much of a problem . Second , focusing speed is not up to par with the canon 20D nor the nikon D70 . If you 're the kind who feels strongly about focusing speed , u might just get frustrated with this one . At the end of the day , minolta has designed one splendid camera , with a few shortcomings . But hey , nothing 's perfect .  
1	  I have a averatec 5110H model laptop . PLEASE DONT BUY anything from averatec . The laptops monitor had a problem only after a week i bought . The customer service is VERY VERY bad . They take 2 weeks time to repair / replace anything . This is during the warranty period ( 1 yr ) . Thereafter , if anything goes wrong you have to ship it back to them , as they dont sell any of their parts outside . Now , this time they took 4 weeks time to repair . Compare this with DELL / MAC . its a 3 days reponse time .  
1	  I was very satisfied with this printer until recently . I had a very important project to print and all the pages came out blank . New cartridge doesn't help .. cleaning heads was no good . Grr ..  
2	  the Case Logic 6 USB wallet is all I wanted and I 'm glad I bought 2 from my reliable Amazon . com online store .  
1	  I picked this up with a music order for my 350d - big mistake . The class came chipped , scratched and smuged ; Tiffen filters are of very poor quality . Do yourself a favor , like I did , and find your local camera supply store and pick up an optical grade filter for maybe , oh , 10 dollars more . This Tiffen one was so bad that the scratches made their way onto some shots and ruined an entire day of shooting .  
1	  Uncompatible software , very confused instruction , bad customer service ( it is said open on Sunday but the call has no answer )  
1	  I ordered this pair of headphones with microphone so I could talk to my teammates while playing multiplayer games online while using the Roger Wilco software . The set works alright for this purpose . The microphone picks up my voice fairly well . However , attaching the mic to the headset was somewhat difficult , and I thought I would break it in the process ( very tight fit & cheap plastic . ) As for the sound quality , it is adaquate for online gaming , however , they they don't put out very much bass at all . A cheap $ .. pair of headphones can be purchased at any electronics store which will produce a bit better sound quality ( but no microphone . )  
2	  The Garmin n & uuml ; vi 360 is an excellent product . I used to have a StreetPilot C330 and upgraded to this one , so i 'm not new when it comes to Garmin GPS navigator . Pros : Excellent software and features , usability and design . Cons : Low speaker volume on Text-to-speech voices .  
1	  YOU LOST THE FIRST ONE I TRIED TO BUY MIND YOU IT WAS THE LAST ONE SO I HAD TO BUY THE DOWNGRADE PUT IT IN FOR THE FIRST TIME AND GUESS WHAT IT WASNT EVEN IN FOR 24 HOURS AND IT STOPPED WORKING LOOKED IN MY TRUNK AND IT WAS SMOKING IN MY BOX .  
2	  The GoodI must say I love this DVD player . The first one I have owned and it playes great . I use the A / V jacks into a 28 inch Phillips Mag TV and it looks like a movie screen . I 'm so spoilled that I don't even rent VHS tapes anymore . I had one problem with a rented DVD ( Wag the Dog ) . But once I cleaned the disk like the manual says it played perfectly . The stero sound is great too . A quick tip though . If you don't have a receiver and just use your TV for sound , in the system setup choose PCM sound and high compression for the best sound . No compression makes you have to turn the TV up real high in order to hear clearly . Make sure the sound on your DVD player matches the one on your DVD when watching movies . I bought The Best Man for my lady and the player was set for Dolby while the disk was sending DTS . Result , no sound and 5 minutes of PANIC . Just match them up again and all is fine . The BadNot being able to burn your own Audio CDs is a bit of a moan . But once you play the Matrix for the first time you get over it . I am mad that I can't play burned Video CDs . Wanted to archive my collection of Kung-Fu movies and tapped Saturday morning Cartoons . But in a year I should be able to upgrade my pc and get a second DVD player for the bedroom so I could do that then . The UglyAll the reports I have heard about the DVD player had made me kinda scared about my future with the RC5220P . The review seem to be about 65 % to 35 % in favor . I am almost past the 2 month mark so I will do a follow up if anything happens . But so far I am on happy camper .  
2	  I 've made about 75 DVD + RW and DVD + R recordings so far with this deck . Not a single bad result . I have successfully tried about 10 different off-the-shelf DVD playback decks and results have been fully compatible . I 've also used a half dozen different brands of media ( all of them fine ) . Both the deck and the user interface exude a well-designed and constructed quality . The user interface is perfect in the sense that it is uncomplicated for making quick recordings , but there is a lot behind the scenes if you dig into it . I agree with another review that a keyboard would be a big improvement ( even a USB port to plug in your own ) . Beyond that , there 's nothing else I 'd want changed .  
1	  This case is minimalistic - yes , size is a nice fit , but it 's a lot softer case than you 'd expect - and bullet-proof nylon is better protection given the sensitive touch screen . This also gets weaker over time - and gets more and more flimsy - there 's just not much to it , other than size . I recommend " The Sherpa " Swissgear , Medium Camera Case by WENGER - didn't see it on Amazon 's site ( and they carry a bunch of WENGER products ) , but they should get it - it 's great for cameras as well , but is perfect for my Tom Tom ONE 3rd Gen - and isn't flush against the inside edges on the sides , like most - and doesn't shift at all . I paid $ 13.99 locally for it and tested about 20 bags / cases in the store until settling on that one . The best case for these is one with hard case and soft , cushion for face - even one where the face never touched a surface would be perfect - and for $ 25 ( list price for this unit ) , you 'd think TomTom would do it right . If they put time and effort into this design , I 'd spend $ 30 or more . Also , the Sherpa has a nice belt strap that some people mentioned was a plus . Hope that 's helpful . I think I 've spent about 10 hours or more testing Garmin , TomTom 's , etc . - and definitely don't want to risk damage to your unit . Please note that my goal for the case is to take it with me on trips - not carry it day to day , from car to car , so that may influence your decision .  
1	  I should have returned it . It barely works better than the simple rabbit ears I was using . I am 20 miles from nearest transmitter .  
2	  This item is small but gives great sound quality and holds plenty of songs . I have seen this same item in other catalogs and a much higher price . For someone just starting out with the digital music scene I would recommend this MP3 player .  
1	  This is probably the fifth cartridge I have replaced and the only one not to work perfectly . This one would produce good quality single pages but incomplete printing of multi-page documents . Amazon was quick to send a replacement after I contacted them but , sent the wrong cartridge .  
2	  I just received my Black V-Moda earbuds . These are awesome , I just threw away my ipod factory buds . V-Moda buds are 100 % better than factory buds . They fit great , look stylish and OH yes .. have great sound . Several of my mp3s have jazz hitting bass , and you can actually feel it . Like have having a mini-subwoofer . Get these earbuds , you won't be sorry .  
1	  Personally , I think these sound terrible ( weak bass , distorted high end , midrange bias ) and tried every combination of all of the ear sleeves . Only with a lot of cramming could I ever get the bass to work and then it would mess up the highs . Very likely its just the specific shape of my particular ear canal . Who 's to say that even 6 different sleeve types are enough ? For travel , I do have some non-earplug type earbuds that came with an inexpensive mp3 player I actually prefer - found them by accident after trying both Sony and the Shure earbuds and not liking either . Did not try the high $ ones though . I would suspect many people might have a problem with the ear plug type headphones . If high quality , accurate sound is important and you can put up dragging around a full sized over the ear headphone the Sony MDR 7502 is one I would recommend that sounds great and is inexpensive and works well with low output devices like portable mp3 players .  
1	  My wife and I received this as a gift and it played records well , but the port where the power cord plugs into the unit started to fall apart after a couple of weeks of intermittent use . At first I could get it to work if I was careful about how I plugged it in , but eventually it just popped out altogether and stopped working . It appeared that it was only held in place with friction and a little glue which , for a product whose company boasts its portability , seemed awfully lacking . Maybe they 've fixed this flaw since . The recessed knobs and speaker were good built-in durability measures but clearly the power cord port was not designed for even the most basic wear and tear . It looked really cool and the sound quality seemed fine , especially on my 78s , but none if it mattered when it stopped working . My guess is that this flaw might not have surfaced had I left it on the table permanently and babied it , but I used it as advertised ( it is called the " Traveler " after all ) and when not in use I stored it suitcase-style as the design suggests . Also the tan material that covers the unit seemed to be applied with a very low grade adhesive and started to peel almost immediately . It was fun while it lasted , I suppose . We have since bought a vintage portable player whose components have stood up better over forty years than Crosley 's Traveler did over two weeks . A classic case of they don't make em like they used to .  
2	  Product is great , but supplier is a cheat . Charged $ 5.40 each for 4 headphone sets but then added $ 23.90 S + H making order total $ 45.86even though supplier stated they charge only $ 2.50 per order which means the total should have been $ 24.46 . Good luck trying emailing supplier to get resolution . Good luck .  
1	  Bought the battery , the shipping and delivery was fast , but the battery did not work with my Toshiba Satellite M35X-S149 laptop - could not be charged and the laptop power utility could not recognize it . Don't know if it was particular battery defect or some general problem with vendor . ( The battery type and shape matches the original one ) . I 'm returning it . 1/17/2008 : update : Got another one - comp did recognize it and charges it . Alex .  
2	  great product . keeps pc cool once the bonding is completed . overclock i5 ivy bridge 38 degrees going steady . I have kept my pc running guild wars 2 for 8 hours straight , no dedicated video card , my temp increase by 2 degrees . this is some real type sh ! t .  
1	  I had this machine for about four months , then it would not recognize any of the DVDs we inserted . I had to ship it off to Mintek for repair . It took about two weeks to get it back . Also , the door that is supposed to pop up with a spring is very weak and takes some coaxing to open . The image is good when it is working ( like most all of these players ) but the quality in manufacturing it is fairly poor .  
2	  A good quality cable at an affordable price . It has worked well for me and I would purchase additional cables of this brand .  
1	  I bought this thermal paste and theCooler Master Hyper 212 Plus 120mm Sleeve CPU Cooler , RR-B10-212P-G1to cool my AMD 8-core FX-8120 , they arrived a few days later , so when i installed my new heatsink i used theStarTech . com 1.5g Metal Oxide Thermal CPU Paste Compound Tube for Heatsink Cooling SILVGREASE1 ( Silver ) instead of the stock one that came with the cpu cooler and the result was a mess , temp went over 86 C while running stress test on Prime95 , i tried everything i imagine , played with the speed of the fans , undervolt the cpu and nothing , until i decided to remove that silver waste in order to apply the stock thermal paste from Cool Master , check again the temps with Prime95 and i got an amazing 43 C while overclocked ! , so my advice to you , if you have a gear similar than mine , do not waste your money on this thermal paste .  
1	  I excitedly bought 4 of these cameras to go snorkeling in Belize . It looks very cool and I love the little lever to snap the photos . However , the proof is in the pictures . They came out horribly grainy , plain and simple . The few that were salvageable required a great deal of retouching . Many years ago I used Kodak 's version of waterproof 35mm cameras and the picture quality was 10 times better . So that 's what I plan to go back to next time and I highly recommend others do the same to avoid disappointment .  
1	  This is NOT 18 Gauge wire its 12 gauge at best , And it is NOT 50ft More like 25ft . I surly got ripped off again at Amazon .  
2	  I have purchased several items on amazon . com and have received excellent service from all . However , the service and responsiveness from this vendor was absolutely superb ! I highly recommend them to anyone who requires their services .  
1	  On first appearance the Tungsten E is great value for money . As time progresses the flaws emerge .. If anything fails after the first three months one might as well throw it away - the warranty is worthless ( $ 129 or more to repair a $ 155 machine ) . The power button may fail - mine failed ten days outside the warranty . The battery has a very limited lifespan , and it cannot be replaced when it fails . Caveat emptor  
1	  I got this device for a road trip from Boston , MA to Vermont and was able to observe its performance in a very populated spectrum in a big city , as well as in an area where there 's barely any radio recpetion . The TuneCase II just falls on its face . Despite having the cool feature ( you pay for it , of course ) of multiple FM frequencies you can use to tune to its broadcast , I was unable to find a clean frequency in Boston , despite spending about 30 minutes on scanning the range . There was always static , and worse , stations suddenly came on the radio and overrode the TuneCast 's transmission . In the backwoods of Vermont , the other shortcoming of the device appeared : no matter where you place the TuneCast , its signal was very weak , the sound was hissy with white noise and unless you turn the volume way up on your car stereo and mp3 player , you could barely hear the music come through . Trying all sorts of angles , holding it by hand , did nothing to help . I am going to look for a way to ' hardwire ' a connection to my car stereo . The TuneCast went back to the store .  
1	  The only issue I had until about a week ago is that the cables they sell to go with this switch do not support DVI-D connections directly . You have to use a DVI-I to DVI-D adapter to plug them into the computer side ( DVI-D ports are very common on built in video , but much less common on stand alone video cards ) . It is not ideal but the converters are available pretty cheaply here and elsewhere so it is not a major issue . Then all the sudden it just broke one day while it wasn't in use . The USB just stopped working after about 2 years . So now I am back to moving cables between computers or having multiple mice . Given the high price of this switch , having to replace it every couple years is not acceptable . If it didn't break it would probably be 4 stars . Not perfect , but a decent option . But I can't recommend it as is .  
2	  A PREVIOUS LISTED REVIEW STATED THAT IT DID NOT WORK FOR THEIR CAMERA , THE Z740 . YOU DO NEED THE 45.5mm-55mm ADAPTER THAT COMES WITH YOUR CAMERA . I HAVE THE Z650 AND IT WORKS FINE WITH THE ADAPTER . GREAT PRICE FOR THE PRODUCT ALSO .  
1	  I purchased this item because my other adapters tend to " click " when in use . Not only did this product click , but the auto reverse would not stop flipping , and my car eventually just popped out the cassette . This happened in two different cars I tried it in . I guess I 'll go back to my " clicking but working great " Phillips adapter .  
1	  I have bought this DVD player in April 2004 and it wasn't playing right from the next day . I figured out that the tray wasn't closing right , so I had fixed the problem myself . Then the remote stopped working . I have replaced the battery , but still didn't help . So , I contacted the customer service and they informed me that a replacement will be sent to me in couple of day . One week , no response at all . I contacted three times and never had a response and they keep telling me it will be sent on priority . They have never sent the remote replacement even after 5 months . I WILL NEVER BUY POLAROID products . DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM .  
2	  I like it . It does occupy more desk space than the Pen Partner that it replaced . It matches the wide screen monitor I 'm using .  
2	  Crucial is the best memory stick maker until now for me . You feel free to use without worries . See all the reviews from people who uses Crucial , even with another sellers . all tests you can make it , the results will be OK . Really . And the price is unbeatable , My Machine works 200 % fast when I change the sticks to this modules . Amazon is the best electronic marketplace of the world .  
1	  Absolute crap - far and away the worst review I 've given a ' product ' on Amazon . Sony should realize just how damaging to their entire product line things like this are . Is it worth it to trash whatever reputation you have on throwaway products ? Wise up . Since CD-Rs are really not very expensive do yourself a big favor and pay a little more for a good one .  
1	  I bought this Expander to increase the range of my Linksys WAP54G Access Point , which has worked flawlessly for me ! So why not buy from the same manufacturer ! ? Here 's why .. Since I was running a secured wifi network with the WAP54G Access Point , I tried to use the Extender 's CD to configure the Extender . The CD software was NEVER able to find the Extender . All I ever got was a message that said " site survey failed . please try again . " So , I decided to use the web-based configuration software . Again , the Extender couldn't be found . ( Meanwhile the software for the WAP54G Access Point could find the Access Point . ) Even after shutting down the security on the Access Point , I got the same results . Next I tried the Extender 's auto configuration button . That didn't work . After spending most of the day working through many technical scenarios ( most found here ) I finally decided to reset my trusty WAP54G Access Point to factory specs ( pressing the reset button for 5 seconds and unplugging it for 30 ) . After that I tried the Extender 's auto config button . SUCCESS ! Or at least thats what I thought . The Extender DOES NOT boost the wifi signal , just " repeats " an already weak signal into a far corner of my house . After I repositioned the Extender several times I finally did get a decent signal . Now that everything was working , it was time to crank up the security on the wifi network again to keep all you nasty hackers and snoopers off my system . Supposedly the Extender can only handle WEP not WAP security . So now it was time to kick up WEP on the Extender . But alas , I didn't have a way to configure the Expander 's security settings and it wouldn't auto config the security settings from my WAP54G Access Point . If I changed the security settings on my WAP54G Access Point , the Expander dropped off the network . I won't run a wifi network without security . The last straw was calling Linksys customer service to figure out the " security " issue . If you can understand English with a heavy Indian accent , you are one step ahead of me . I gave up on the first customer service person . Mostly because I was too frustrated to be reasonable with the thick accented customer service person . So , I called back the next day and customer service person # 2 had less of an accent but left me on hold for over 20 minutes . I finally had enough . I hung up and packed up the Extender and sent it back . I spent two days trying to get that thing to work . I 'd bash Linksys , but I that wouldn't be fair . They make some great products , but this isn't one of them . Conclusion - if you live out in the quiet country side somewhere , with no one else around , this might be the " unsecured wifi " product for you . ( don't forget you need to have a Linksys Access Point and reset everything to factory specs before trying to auto config ) . If you live anywhere else , I 'd say pass on this hopelessly flawed product .  
1	  I bought this player as a gift for my son , who is crazy for LPs . The first use demonstrated a slow and uneven play speed . After about 10 minutes , the turntable ground to a halt . We can hear the motor straining , but nothing is happening . The company forces the customer to pay shipping , even when the product is under warranty . Amazon needs to stop using this supplier . The Crosley company is well below their standards .  
2	  I used these to connect my router to my modem and router to BD / Xbox360 worked great . My wireless connection actually doubled because of the cable from modem to router . I 'm sure the rest of my connections got better , but my wireless was the only one I was monitoring .  
2	  If you find one in good shape - BUY IT ! I bought one locally off Craigslist very cheap , with intention to listen to SACD . I was extremely impressed of sound quality and soon after , I bought a second H / K DVD48 off eBay .. I never found one here .. This is the best SACD played for on budget listeners , without compromising sound quality !  
1	  The reviews for this product are excellent and I was so excited to upgrade to HDMI switching . The first unit received had a loud hum in the audio and HDMI from my new Sony player through this unit created an extreme blue cast on the video . I returned the unit and another was sent to me . This unit had no hum in the audio but the blue cast was still there when using HDMI from the Sony DVD player . It was not the DVD player because when I hooked the HDMI from the DVD player directly to my TV everything was perfect . I am very disappointed in this unit . As for Amazon , they have been great in responding to my problems , getting a replacement unit to me and then refunding my purchase . I give Amazon 5 stars .  
1	  Sounds repetitive , but it 's true : worked for one month , then even with a new bulb , it didn't . I know it 's getting power , because the power light is on , but no zap-o-matic . I agree with all the other reviews-this is recycling material that should have been canned at the engineering stage , not mass-produced and pushed in fancy packaging to big-box retailers . What in the world causes companies to produce garbage like this and expect the word won't get out ?  
2	  Excellent SLR digital camera . Initial shipping report was in fact delayed a few days as camera was not in stock .  
2	  I was a little concerned about purchasing this item , due to some of the reviews about too much static . I have to admit , I live right outside of St . Louis , MO and I don't have any problems with static whatsoever . While driving around residential areas I may get a little static but nothing that changing the station can't solve . I recently went on a 3.5 hour car ride and the thing worked flawlessly ; no static , no changing stations , and crisp music as if it were coming from a CD . It also charges your iPod / iPhone , which is just icing on the cake . I had seen a similar product at Target for $ 67 and it did not even charge the device .. needless to say , very happy I made the purchase .  
1	  1 . Drivers provided with mouse do not work with Windows XP . Updating with drivers on website does not help . Defuault XP mouse driver works ( sort of - see below ) . 2 . Mouse locks up several times a day , requiring a hard system reboot to resume operation . 3 . mouse occasionally goes into continuous-scroll mode in Microsoft Word and Excel . I would not recommend this product to anyone .  
1	  The battery I received does not last at all . I don't know if it is a problem with my notebook , but I 've bought batteries before and this one seems to be a battery way past the end of its useful life .  
2	  When I moved up to a gigabit network I had a lot of problems with my networks cat5e wires . Every thing worked OK at 10/100 speeds but when I installed a gigabit router some of the cables wouldn't work at all . With this tester you can test the wires while they are still in the wall . I found a number of bad Modular Plugs and crossed wires with this tester and replaced them with cat6 plugs . Now my network is great . For those of you that are considering building your own cables for your network this tool will do the job . It comes with very clear instructions on how to make good cables and you can save a lot of money by making your own cables .  
2	  Vact 7mm 100-pack Single Slim DVD movie casesOrdered and received these cases . Quality not as good as previously purchased elsewhere ; but worth the price and are sufficient for my needs .  
1	  I have taken many pictures , one using this diffuser and the same picture without the diffuser . The pictures without the diffuser looked natural , the ones with the diffuser had a brownish tinge to it . Pictures of faces using this diffuser look too tanned and I have to correct the color in my photo processing program . I also find my pictures come out darker with it then without it so it does lose some flash from your 430EX . I find it a nice idea but it also has its problems . I prefer to not use it and bounce the flash whenever possible .  
1	  It took me over an hour to set up because there wasn't any specific direction to help me set up . I use Vista and over 3 year old manual doesn't mention anything . ( though , the box says it supports ) When I finally figured out and set up . It didn't really work better than my integrated laptop WLAN . It shows connections with more bars but i had hard time connecting and even after the successful connection , speed was slower than before . I 'm returning the item tomorrow .  
2	  Sure , it 's over-priced , but so are most of Apple 's toys . This nifty little device fits snugly into the bottom of your iPod and transmits to most non-music stations on your car radio , boat radio or home radio . There can be some static , so it takes a bit of moving around to find the perfect reception . Mine works fine in the glove compartment of my car or sitting on top of my home receiver . It sure beats having an adapter to deal with and you can carry it out of your car for safe keeping .  
2	  These are good floppies and they work well . I don't need floppies that often but on the occasional need these work fine .  
1	  I understood the af would be an issue but it doesn't produce clear pictures . used with d40x with a 70-300 , d40x & 18-55 . no autofocus at all on these pictures fuzzy on tripod . used with d200x and 200-400 af worked fine but fuzzy pictures . used with d2x and 300mm 2.8 on tripod . af worked but pictures still fuzzy . not worth the 15 % restock fee and shipping to return it .  
2	  This is a wonderful lens with great features for Macro photography . The image quality probably rivals that of any " brand name " lens . As with most any lens , the fixed focal length provides greater quality than the multipurpose zoom lenses with macro facility . However , the focal length multiplier factor of 1.6 should be remembered when using this lens on most consumer / prosumer DIGITAL cameras . This makes the lens an effective 168mm focal length . Shorter , fixed focal length lenses are available both for traditional SLR cameras and also for digital SLRs . As stated on the Sigma site : " The 70mm focal length gives an equivalent field of view as our popular 105mm macro lens when used on digital SLR cameras with an APS-C size image sensor . "  
2	  Am not a pro , but it works for a person that likes to have all the family members on the digital pictures or who gets tired of holding the video camera for long period of time . Great level of quality from this product ; I had this for more than 4 years and still works like new ! Very Happy customer  
1	  The external covering is made of very cheap plastic . I tried to insert a key chain into the end square-loop - which broke with a moderate amount of pressure . I recommend any Kingston 1GB which you can find here for half !  
1	  The outside of the case is fine but I was disappointed to find no padding of any kind inside the case to protect my computer . Consequently , I would not recommend purchasing this product .  
1	  Cheaper option is not the best some time and here you have one . It can't support my mobile phone or my portable hard drive , some time I need to unplug and plug again in order to use . If you have money go to a better one .  
2	  First off I wanted to say to the people complaining about the smell , I smell it too but what is causing the smell is the " lamp bulb . " Reason is because it is new and needs to I guess what you would call it is " get warmed up " and then it should go away after a while when it has been used . Right now I do smell it and I have been using it for a few hours since I just got it Monday evening . The smell will be noticable every time you get a new " lamp bulb " so get used to it . Now back to this wonderful product , I love it and I have not even put up my 106 " screen yet . I am projecting images on a white wall right now and still looks great . It was very easy to set up and movies , video games , even digital cable looked pretty good , not that great , but decent enough . This product made me feel like I was in a movie theater and I have to say that the built in speakers are not that bad at all .. I still would recommend getting a 5.1 surround sound to go with it . I don't know what else I can say about this product , it is a all in one product that just fit what I was looking for and love it . Be warned though that the " lamp bulb " will die on you after about 2,000-3,000 hours and it will cost you roughly $ 300 + . It will give you a warning as to when the bulb is going to go out so you have time to get a new one to replace the old one . So in my opinion that is the only thing I don't like about projectors but this product as given me my moneys worth so far and would highly recommend it to anyone that can afford it .  
2	  I got this DVD player and I 'm very pleased with it ! The quality of the sound and video is great as Toshiba players usally are . Also with the added Dolby Digital Decoder onboard makes it even better for people who have a capable receiver / stereo w / out decoder . Also features both Digital audio coax & optical outputs for someone who has one or the other . Like the review above said the jog style is a little funny to work but it 's not to bad . I really like this player and it 's perfect and has all you need if your looking for a decent quality player that sounds and makes video look great .  
2	  My laptop 's screen had been cracked , so I needed an HDMI cable to connect it to my TV . My roommate has a 6 foot cable , but it didn't allow for me to comfortably work on my laptop . I needed a longer cable , but at Best Buy a 10 foot cable is $ 150 ! When I was told about this product , I didn't believe that it would work since $ 6 for a 25-footer seems like I 'm almost cheating . But it works . It actually looks sharper and more colorful than a Dynex , whose 6 foot cable cost $ 25 . I can't recommend this product enough , and I 'm so glad that I looked at this rather than going to Best Buy .  
1	  We originally received this product as a holiday gift in 2007 . After a couple of months , this first version started to lock-up the dvds we would play in the last half-hour of the movie , without fail . We thought it was the dvds that we were getting from Netflix , but it also locked-up on the few dvds that we own . So after a year of dealing with this , we were able to finagle a brand-new system , the same model , sent to us from Philips , but I specifically requested a different manufacture date in order to avoid the same problem . This unit also started to lock-up our dvds after about a year or so . So finally , in the last half hour of Avatar ( which we never saw in the theater ) , I couldn't take it and my fist went through the player unit repeatedly . I would not trust another Philips brand product again after this . Pros : great sound , slim design , easy to use . Cons : dvd lock-up ( always in the final moments of a movie ) , loud ( high-pitch whizzing or low-pitch grumbling when dvd is in play ) , unresponsive with controls , just an overall poorly executed product .  
1	  The LCD screen broke shortly after purchase and on a radio this user un-friendly , it was almost unusable . A few months later , the volume got stuck at the highest level than it just stopped playing . Avoid this piece of junk .  
2	  This camera is the best value in this class hands down . It 's so easy to operate , I love all the features , and it takes the best pictures , pictures as good as cameras costing much more . All I can say is you can't go wrong with this camera , price , quality of photos , and I have owned simalar cameras that just can't match this one . Buy this camera .  
2	  When I first plugged this item in I couldn't find a frequency that it would work properly on . However , on the second try when I had a few more minutes to fiddle with it and try more frequencies , I found one that came in perfectly clearly . I love this thing ! I used to use one that only had 4 possible frequency settings and ran on batteries through the earphone jack of the iPod . This way is much better ( full band of frequencies available , including even tenths ie 88.2 , runs on vehicle 's power through the charging jack of the iPod ) .  
1	  The projector does in fact have many nice qualities , but if you see it up for sale you should definitely pass on it , as it has a major defect that affects all of this line of Sony projectors , as well as many other older LCD projectors . Though it will vary with each individual unit , with normal use , the blue polarizer will start to get damaged , leaving a permanent blue streak in the video that will only grow over time . There 's no setting or bulb replacement that will fix it . From what I 've found from research , it seems like these polarizers were made with an organic compound that breaks down over time ( supposedly newer LCD projectors have polarizers that are made with inorganic compounds that won't break down like this ) , and there 's no simple solution to fix it . Sony support claims that to fix it will cost around $ 2,000 , so it doesn't make much sense to send it back . It 's ridiculous that even though it is inherently defective , Sony won't stand by and support their customers . If you do pick up one of these , you should be aware that they could go bad at any time , and aren't build to last at all . If you 're curious to learn more , just google " VPL-HS51 blue smear " .  
2	  This is a fast router with a very reliable connection . Don't miss this one ! It 's the deal of a lifetime ! I love it !  
1	  once again I thought cheap would win and it didnt - ate the very first CD and never spit it out - fm reception not good - if it didnt have the aux in and the usb in , it would be on display up on hiway 280  
2	  I purchased this battery for my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ20 and it fits perfectly in the battery compartment , just like the original battery . Same level of performance as the original battery .  
1	  The picture is a power supply , the item is a power cord for a laptop .  
2	  I bought Monster Cables from Best Buy for $ 40.00 . When I saw these online , I immediately returned the Best Buy cables and ordered these . Great investment as there is no difference except more money in my pocket .  
2	  This flash drive was just as advertised . Simple , working , and easy to use . I really liked that the cap fit on the back , as in the past I have had flash drives where the cap wouldn't fit on the back and they became very easy to loose . I would definitely buy from this seller again .  
1	  I use it with a vaio laptop . The cursor jumps around all over . Very hard to use sometimes . I am typing and I tend to look at my hands and I find when I look up , the cursor has jumped to some other location and I am not at the end of the document . Then I have to move the text . Bad !  
1	  Okay , I bought this camera back in June and I only played with it a couple times . In August I went to Austria and visited a couple of landmarks and by the end of the day is was buggy . We were down in some mines and I guess it got moist because it said Dew Damage . Luckly for me I have a Panasonic dealer who sent it in for repair and I just got it back and now it eats tapes , you have to pry open the mini dv tape holder , and the record but is sticky .  
2	  This rest is a tad on the firm side , so don't be expecting something really soft or squishy . The seam along the outside of the pad looks like it might come apart after a while - as some reviewers have said . It looks like the pad is just pressure stamped + glued together .  
1	  If you have decided to read these comments you may have seen that 15 out of 17 readers found this review helpful . Honesty dictates I reveal that that statistic pertained to the old review . This review of the AT-PL120 has been extensively rewritten ( Aug . , 2009 ) . I have owned and used this turntable for over a year which has translated into experience with this unit , and a few other direct drive turntables . The AT-PL120 tries really hard to pass itself off as a virtual Technics 1200 series turntable . Do not be fooled by pictures on a web page . It 's only similarity is in appearance . The AT-PL120 comes with a quartz controlled pitch lock which does a good job of keeping platter speeds constant . The platter 's drive motor has abundant torque to keep the platter rotating for record cleaning before playing . The AT-PL120 starts up with the quartz lock disengaged leaving the pitch control slider in control of your platter . If you want the quartz lock in control you must press it 's button every time you turn on the turntable . And , a heads up to any budget minded prospective DJs attracted by this turntable 's " Professional " designation , any messing around you do with popping the platter light up and down , pressing speed control buttons , or moving the slider through it 's center detent will result in ' thumps ' that will be efficiently transmitted to the phono cartridge and mixed with the music . The aluminum platter comes with a felt slip mat which has an enviable capacity to attract static . Often when removing a played record from the platter I found the slip mat clinging for dear life to the underside of the record . As for the platter itself , if you tap it 's outer rim with your fingernail you get a bell-like ringing sound for your effort which the felt slip mat does very little toward dampening . I discovered that a home made cork platter mat made from a 12 " x 12 " cork square available from a local crafts store brought the ringing down to a dull thud . The homemade cork mat does not try to cling to the bottom of the record either . Of course , if you want to keep using the included felt mat , a light application of Gruv-Glide to records as per it 's directions does a nice job of controlling static . The included ATP-2 cartridge is intended for heavy duty DJ use as it needs to track at 3 to 5 grams . That was a bit heavy for my taste so I put the ATP-2 aside until I read a suggestion in another review to try a 205-DET stylus in the cartridge . Since the ATP-2 cartridge is factory aligned in it 's included headshell this was simply a matter or removing the DJ stylus assembly and replacing it with the 205-DET assembly ( Audio Technica ATXN5 stylus ) which can track at a much more acceptable and lighter 1.5 grams . This setup has no glaring sonic vices and is very good at finding high frequency sounds that the Shure M97xE pulls back on . It is one I choose often for rock music listening . Going back for a moment to the fact that the ATP-2 cartridge is factory installed - I checked the Technics 230mm overhang gauge against the factory install and found that the ATP-2 stylus was positioned exactly at the point it would have ended up at had it been installed with the Technics gauge . If you plan to buy extra headshells for extra cartridges for this turntable or if you want to install another cartridge on the included headshell the Technics gauge makes the cartridge alignment process very much easier . It is available online and it is not that expensive . This turntable can produce a hum . Higher output cartridges can be played at lower volume settings which will keep the hum from being heard . Records recorded at higher volume levels also help . Certain discount hit compilation albums recorded at lower volume levels to squeeze an extra song or two onto a side may require higher receiver volume levels for listening and may bring the hum to a level where is audible . We move now to the tonearm which has an adjustable counterweight at the rear . Other reviewers have commented that the counterweight rotates too freely . If you look closely you will find a small slotted set screw on the body of the counterweight . If you tighten this screw just to the point where you feel resistance you will have it set where the counterweight can turn if needed yet remain where you position it . Reviewers have also commented that the rotating gauge on the front of the counterweight also rotates too freely and loses all association it had with the most recent determination of tracking force . Mine had this problem . I eventually resorted to forcing a bit of petroleum jelly into the crack between the gauge and the counterweight which let me move the gauge if needed and yet kept it coupled to the counterweight when I needed to set the tracking force . The next subject has to do with the tonearm 's antiskate feature . With the turntable level and the antiskate setting adjusted to zero the tonearm counterweight is adjusted so the tonearm is floating , balanced and horizontal , and away from the tonearm rest . On my AT-PL120 the tonearm will drift to a position just a bit outward from the edge of the platter and stay there . On my new Technics 1200 the tonearm will stay were originally positioned . On my AT-PL120 moving the antiskate setting to 1 hardly causes any tonearm movement at all . Further increasing the AT-PL120 's tonearm setting to it 's maximum setting 7 causes the tonearm to move only an inch toward the tonearm rest before stopping . On my new Technics 1200 moving the tonearm 's antiskate setting to only 1 will start it on a smooth , easy , yet determined migration toward the tonearm rest where it will not stop until it has met the upright arm of the rest . Recently the AT-PL120 's cueing mechanism lost all it 's dampening fluid leaving a tonearm that descended too rapidly onto the surface of the record . I was directed to an online source which sold me a tube of silicone dampening fluid , a viscous , sticky substance which was applied to the post attached to the tonearm lift . It worked it 's way in and tonearm lift control is again active . To the list of tonearm related woes add a broken tonearm latch , which is the black plastic hook that keeps the tonearm secured to the tonearm rest when the turntable is not being used . I was just routinely easing it off the tonearm to play a record and it just snapped off . The latch is held on by a small Philips head screw on the back side of the tonearm rest post , and is easy enough to replace once you figure out how to get a screwdriver tip into it 's slots . Instead of sending away to Audio-Technica for a replacement latch of similar quality I fashioned a workable latch from a section of a rubber coated paper clip and screwed that on instead . I anticipate it will last much longer than the stock latch . My original magnetic cartridge turntable ( a Technics ) is 28 years old and still has it 's original tonearm latch . Go figure . The last subject relates to setting tonearm assembly height . My factory AT-PL120 manual tells me this feature " .. allows for the tonearm to be positioned parallel to the record surface , when using extra-tall cartridge bodies , thick slip mats , or thick records ( i.e. old 78s ) . " Apparently I can raise the pivot of the tonearm if the cited factors force my headshell higher than the pivot to make the tonearm again level with the record . Unfortunately , out here in the real world , my situation was exactly the opposite . With every cartridge and headshell combination I tried on the AT-PL120 the tonearm pivot was higher than the headshell . I could not lower the pivot from it 's lowest physically possible position to level the tonearm as signs of stressing plastic tonearm assembly parts became evident if I tried to urge it any lower . ( And , yes , the Lock was disengaged . ) In fact , my tonearm could never be lowered to it 's indicated zero setting . It always showed firm resistance at a point between Zero and One best described as 1/4 . It is evident that extra-tall cartridge bodies and thick slip mats and records would actually help in making my AT-PL120 tonearm parallel to the record . On my new Technics 1200 series turntable , using the same cartridges and headshells , I can actually lower the pivot to make the tonearm parallel , and there are subtle yet noticeable sound benefits to be gained from this capability . As for the important question of how did it sound , it could actually sound decent . But I wonder how much of that was due to what the cartridge could do for the turntable . The AT-PL120 is better than the lesser turntables hovering around $ 100 ( I have one of those too in a box somewhere .. ) . The lingering question in my mind is how much better would it sound with a higher quality tone arm that a turntable with an MSRP of $ 399.00 should have ?  
1	  I bought the Speck iPod armband because of the sleek design . I didn't want a huge armband . However , the two times I used it , my iPod froze up after about 20 minutes . I contacted the company and she told me that the iPod is guaranteed not to skip for 20 minutes , but after that it 's possible for it to skip or lock up . I guess my arm moves too much for the iPod in the armband to continue functioning . In theory , it 's a great product , but unfortunately it didn't work for me . My guess is the iPod isn't designed to be worn / carried this way .  
2	  Pros : Installation was easy , no jamming , always recovers itself after energy blackouts . Cons : Poor signal across concrete homes . In such conditions you may need to get a repeter .  
2	  I bought this product for my 2nd gen 80GB zune . As others have written , it definitely is snug when in the dock . That said , it certainly still fits even without taking the cover off of the dock ( which , should you still want to , is EXTREMELY easy ) . And personally , I don't see why one would be bothered by it being firmly in place .. For the ~ $ 20 I spent for it , it is definitely worth the money and I 'm VERY glad I didn't shell out the extra money for the newer home av pack . For me , the fact that I can now control my zune with the remote and that I can leave it charging in the dock continually makes this a must have .  
1	  I purchased the camcorder for family events etc . The video quality is good , get what you pay for , but the still picture quality is / was horrible ( @ . 39 ) ! I took the camcorder back to Best Buy and will continue to look for a good zoom , high quality still & video CCD .  
2	  I bought this player because it could play MP3 Cd 's and hold 5 disks . I was very surprised with the versatility of the product . All of the features are useful and well planned out . I especially enjoy the onscreen menu of MP3 files . When I invite people over for drinks , I put the T.V. on and it opens up a whole realm of discussion . The chicks really dig the selection . Yet , you must close all of your MP3 Cd 's before the machine will play them , and it 's really embarassing when a disk fails in the machine and you have to turn it off to get anything working . But , as with any first-generation product , the concept is worth paying for . I 'd buy it again .  
2	  since I bought this pressure cooker , I use a few times , it is very good , I like it , it is worth to buy it .  
2	  First off , I am NOT your average buyer . Meaning , that I research prices and items for great value . I consider a value the amount of money that I am spending , for the material and / or workmanship that I am receiving . That being said , this receiver marks an EXCELLENT value for the price in what you are getting . The touch screen is amazing , and the gps is near flawless . I highly suggest adding the Bluetooth and Ipod adapter as well as the Sat . Radio option . This adds to the total value of the unit . Did I mention that this thing also plays MOVIES strait out of the box ? Amazing . I have had it for over 3 months now and have not had a singular problem . If you want to spend thousands on another unit , be my guest , but there is no challenging the value of this buy , and its a Pioneer .  
1	  My husband and I received this monitor for our baby shower . We selected this model because it had the two monitors and the price was resonable . Well I firmly believe you get what you pay for because this monitor does not hold a charge . We have to have the monitors plugged in at all times for it to work . The batteries just dont hold a charge . The reception is good but we can't unplug it and use it around the house . We wound up throwing it out and purchasing a new one . Don't waste you money on this monitor .  
2	  I was really looking forward to receiving this digital picture frame in the mail . I was like a little kid ( and still am ) when I opened the Amazon . com shipping box , to reveal the colorful Kodak packaging with the long awaited digital picture frame in it . The digital frame was well packaged , protected with its own wrapping within the box , and a thin transparent sheet protecting the screen . Nothing the postman could have done could have damaged the product during shipping . The digital frame comes with a CD , for both Windows and Macintosh , and allows you to install in ten different languages : English , French , German , Italian , Spanish , Portuguese , Polish , Czech , and Turkish . During installation , you will be prompted on whether you would like to check the internet for a newer version of the software . I found that a newer version was available , and that was automatically downloaded and then seamlessly installed . The software is very easy to use and will automatically search your computer for all stored pictures . Within seconds ( depending on how many pictures you have ) you will have all your pictures neatly organized in one folder . A remote control , with battery included , is also in the package . It has a separate stand that attaches to the back of the frame , making it convenient to store your remote control . The remote control is a must , and turns the digital frame into a user friendly product . In fact , I didn't even have to read the owner 's manual . It is really very easy navigating the frame 's menus and settings . It is much easier setting this digital frame than your DVD player or microwave ! A few tips though : The remote buttons must be pressed hard and kept pressed for a good second ; you must be within a straight line and not too far away from the frame . If you are experiencing problems , change the battery . USB cables are also included to allow you to connect to your computer or directly to your digital camera . The USB cable will also allow you to upgrade the firmware on your digital frame . In order to upgrade your firmware , go to ww . kodak . com / digitalframesupport , choose your product , and then click on downloads and drivers . Once you download the new firmware , you must first unzip it on your computer , then connect your computer with your digital frame with the included USB cable , and transfer the unzipped ` img ' file by dragging and dropping it on your memory card ( which is not included ) inserted in your digital frame . Then it is a simple three step method of going to your frame 's menu , then to ` settings ' , and clicking on ` upgrading the firmware ' . Once the firmware is upgraded , you need to switch off your digital frame , wait 5 seconds , and then turn it back on . You should check every month for a new firmware for your frame and EasyShare software updates for your computer . I noticed a few important improvements once the new firmware was installed . The pictures were clearer ; there were no more any error messages while displaying the pictures , and more of the pictures were displayed when ` fit to screen ' was selected . I highly recommend you check for a firmware upgrade as soon as you receive your digital frame . A unique feature is that you can also communicate wirelessly with your digital frame , allowing you to share your pictures with your home network . This is really a neat feature that is fun , convenient , and just simply cool ! Your digital frame can also access the internet wirelessly and keep its internal clock set to the correct time . This is useful when you set your frame to switch on only at certain times . For example , you can schedule your frame to display pictures only during the day , and automatically turn off at night , only to resume displaying pictures again in the morning at a specific time you determine . This is a unique feature that is energy saving , and will give your frame a longer life than simply keeping it on all the time . As mentioned above , no memory cards are included on which to record your pictures . The digital frame will accept the following memory cards : SD , MS , xD , MMC , CF , and MD . The frame has an internal 128 MB of storage , hardly enough for the savvy photographer . The memory cards need to be formatted first before you record your images on them . I first formatted my Sony SD memory card using NTFS , but my digital frame was unable to read it . This was before I did the firmware upgrade . When I formatted the memory card using FAT32 , the digital frame read my memory card and displayed the pictures . I am not sure whether future firmware upgrades would allow NTFS formatting , but this is not needed . Make sure you format using FAT32 ! Some additional nice features of this digital frame : the possibility of choosing different picture wipes and duration during the slideshow ; brightness control ; ability to print pictures directly from your digital frame ; audio background during picture display ; video display ; and fit to screen feature . This is really a great and very easy to use digital picture frame . It is so nice to watch all my travels , adventures , celebrations , parties , and gatherings that span a period of many years on one digital frame . Time really does fly ! And as your pictures will testify , life is beautiful . Peace and love to everyone , God bless you all , and may you have a long and healthy life preserved in pictures for generations to come to enjoy !  
1	  I don't think I 've ever been as disappointed with any electronics component as I have been with the Pinnacle TV tuner card . Here 's what you 're SUPPOSED to get : the Pinnacle TV tuner card accepts incoming video signals through an included S-video in , composite in , or conventional cable / Antenna input . Software supplied allows you to switch between those three inputs ; in the case of the cable / antenna input , a built in tuner allows tuning in VHF / UHF channels 2 to 83 , or cable channels from 2 to 160 ( or therabouts ) . The video signal is displayed on a resizable screen , which operates much like a conventional window ; or as a full screen display . Audio handling is sparse at best ; the card has an audio out jack ( no audio in ) and you are supplied with a small external jumper cable , which you are expected to run from the audio out jack to the external input jack on your sound card . ( Lets hope you 're not already using it for something else . ) The card also has an internal audio out jack , but no cord is supplied ; and the unconventional plug is difficult to find . The card offers you the opportunity to watch TV in a variable sized screen ; to record TV ; and to pause live broadcasts , giving you the rough equivalent of a Tivo or Personal Video Recorder . When you hit pause , the screen freezes , and the video signal is diverted to your hard drive as a digital datastream . Hit pause again , and the data comes off your hard drive and is displayed on your screen , while new data continues to be recorded to your hard drive . In this fashion you can jump forward and back through the program , playing the same section over again , skipping past commercials , and generally having a merry old time . At least , that 's the sales pitch . The difference between the Pinnacle PCTV and the Pinnacle PCTV Pro , is that the pro includes a stereo TV decoder ( the non-pro version is mono only ) . If you read the enclosed advertisng material , you will be told that the Pro also includes a stereo FM tuner ; and indeed , the Pinnacle PCTV Pro website states , " Watch TV or listen to the radio on your PC . " However , when you purchase the Pinnacle Pro card , you will find that there is NO radio tuner , there is NO FM antenna input ( even though one is clearly illustrated in the enclosed advertising ) , and indeed there is virtually no hardware difference between the two cards . But the lies and deceit don't stop there . Let 's go back to the claims made for the card on the Pinnacle website . " Create your own movies from video captured from TV , VCR or Camcorder with the easy to use Studio software . " Well , true enough .. but they fail to mention that the Studio software supplied is a 30 DAY TRIAL . After that point , the software locks up , and you are expected to purchase it , at great additional cost . Without this software , you can still record TV shows ; but you cannot edit out commercials , string multiple shows into one presentation , or any other commonly done VCR-type tasks . You can start recording , stop recording , and that 's it . No pause , no nothing . Let 's talk about the hardware for a moment .. or lack thereof . You see , there 's not much hardware here , and that 's a problem . That conventional NTSC or PAL TV signal is analog , and it needs to be converted to a digital format FAST . The digital conversion takes a lot of processing power , and the conversion from raw digital video to MPEG format takes an awful lot more . Most TV cards that permit recording and PVR functionality - such as the Hauppage 350 , available through Amazon - accomplish this with built in hardware MPEG encoders / decorders . Not so the Pinnacle card ; it makes use of your computer horsepower , substituting a software program for a hardware chip . This is fine , at least in theory ; but to make it work , you need to have well written software , and enough computing horsepower to dim the lights in the neighborhood whenever you boot up the machine . I was using an Athlon XP 1800 + with 768 megs of 333 Mhz RAM , two 40 GB Maxtor Diamondmax 7200 RPM Hard drives in a RAID 0 configuration , and Windows XP home .. and it wasn't enough . Even with all nonessential programs and services shut down , the performance was still unsatisfactory . A minimum 2.5 GHz processor and 1 GB of FAST RAM - and a state of the art video card , like a high end Geforce FX or equivalent Radeon - would be a minimum requirement . But even then , the software is so glitchy , buggy , unreliable and undependable as to make the whole procedure an exercise in frustration . Oh , I could go on . I could talk about the audio drifting out of sync with the video every time you change channels , making it impossible to channel surf . I could talk about the included remote that turns the software off , but won't start it again . I could tell you about the amazingly unhelpful technical support , the fiendishly confusing driver downloads section , the dozens of bugs .. but you must get the picture by now . This is a lousy product . It was implemented by a rank amateur with no concept of quality , and a keen desire to save money on manufacturing . The software was written by an individual or group without the faintest concept of the procedures necessary to write quality software - and it shows , all over the place . There 's a lot of amateur freeware that is better written than is the software packaged with this product . This software has more bugs than a cheap , inner city flophouse . The lack of ethics in marketing , production , and execution all speak volumes in describing Pinnacle Corporation as a company desperate to sell a fundamentally defective product in any way possible , including lies , treachery and deceit . However , all the glitzy packaging , the loud promises and enthralling hype can do nothing to change this product from what it really is : a sad little electronics disaster . If , after all I 've said , you 're still contemplating buying this card , let me offer you one last word of advice : buy the card from a retailer with a very generous returns policy . Because you 're going to be taking advantage of it .  
2	  I had to replace my old eight port router because of a power incident at my home ( it got fried ) . I bought this to get a few more ports and noticed that I can get a link quicker . It doesn't take up much room on my desk , and I like that too . I 've had it a couple of months now and it has worked flawlessly .  
2	  This antenna works great . I live in Los Angeles and I have this just sitting in my living room . I get more channels than with my previous antenna that was powered . I am going to mount this on the roof of my building to see if I get better reception but so far it is working great .  
2	  No complaints at all . Origionally bought this to bring to parent teacher conferences , however , my wife used this at the toy store she manages for some EVP work due to suspicion of a new haunting by a recently deceased co worker . anyways , the thing picks up every pop , bazng , scratch , and voice . Excellent product , works great for meetings as well , the software is intuitive and flexable .  
1	  I recently bought one of these - It was to be my third digital camera from Olympus . it seemed a perfect fit for me , since my last camera died from me getting it wet . To start with the positive : The form factor is great , and it really feels solid . But the negative list is a bit longer : The controls are VERY basic , with only some static modes - moreover it doesn't have a hardware switch for modes like the d-40 or 740uz . You have to use the LCD interface to do it . But the real problem with this camera was the indoor photo quality . I actually returned this camera , as I was VERY disappointed with the quality of the indoor pictures . Even self timer shots from a tripod were blurry ! I got the 740UZ instead . it is WAY bigger , but at least it takes decent pictures . If you are going to buy this camera , make sure you buy it from amazon or another place with a good returns policy !  
1	  Bought this system as way to protect my garage . Cold weather renders the Infrared detector useless and the door sensor goes through a battery every month . Outdoor siren is difficult to sync with control unit and mine went off for no reason and did not sound when it should have .  
1	  This is a cheap version of something better . It took hours to recharge the battery even a little . We went back to using the chord that came with the iPod that plugged into the computer ( via USB ) . I believe this to be a cheap foreign imitation . Spend the extra littel bit of money and buy the proper chord .  
2	  I bought this camera right after it came out . It was recommended to me by my dealer , because I was looking for a digital camera with at least 4 mega pixels , that I could use on land and underwater , in a [ certain ] price range .. This camera has fulfilled all those requirements beautifully . Things I like about the camera : it 's compact , easy to use , has a lot of features that you don't even need to know in the beginning to get started . I started taking pictures right away by setting it to Auto . But as you want to learn more , the camera can do more . It 's very easy to use underwater . You turn it on , set it so that the it will power down after a minute of disuse , turn off the display to conserve the battery , pop it into its housing , run some silicon around the o-ring , and off you go . On a recent dive trip , I was able to take photos for two dives on a single battery . Then I 'd go back to my room for a bit of rest , change the battery , put some more silicon onj the seal and close it up again . I couldn't believe how easy it was . At the end of the day , I 'd go through my shots and delete the ones I didn't like . You can also zoom in on your photos in the display mode to take a close up look without having to hook your camera up to a computer . On land , I recently hooked the camera up to my tripod and took a family portrait with the timer setting . It takes action shots , low light shots , panoramic shots ( through stitching ) , hi resolution shots , low resolutions shots , you name it , this camera does it .  
2	  I 'm very pleased with the Quicklink Pen . My mother , who is not a " gadget " person , was even more amazed with it . We 've done several scanners . We have a 4 inch hand scanner , a flatbed , even one that takes 81/2x11 sheets and scans them . They all work great for what they do , but the biggest pain is scanning in books , especially when all you want is a couple of paragraphs . Enter the Quickpen . It takes a few tries to get the right angle for scanning , but that 's like anything - there 's a small learning curve . The best is being able to lay down in my hammock with a book in hand , and the scanner in the other . When I find a quote that I like , I scoop it up with the pen . Something I greatly look forward to is the memory expansion pak . I ordered it today , and have been longing for years for the ability to translate text on the fly , as I 'm interested in other languages . I 'll tell you how it goes !  
1	  The product I received is defective . When a plug is inserted into the outlet it is so tight it pushed the contacts down into the unit so they do not work . Can it be exchanged ? Thxdave stroble  
2	  Have had the TV for a month now and all is well . Great price , fast delivery and great picture . Anything HD looks amazing , other shows look marginal at best but that can be said about any HD TV . No shows are broadcast in 1080p yet anyways so 720p is just fine . If you 're looking for the best value out there get this TV !  
1	  Want a frustrating part time job with no pay ? Buy a Zune . I bought mine back in October . Plays music just fine . The nightmare is managing the music files and updates . I use a trusted software program - Media Monkey - to manage all my music files on my PC . When I did the initial setup the Zune grabbed all of the music files from Media Monkey . When I went into my Zune Library , most of the CD 's were broken into 2 pieces , with some songs in one file and some in another . So I spent a lot of time in my Zune library trying to put the files back together . Some changes were accepted , some would not stick . I spent a lot of time making changes , syncing to my Zune device , and then finding new problems in the library . Then I tried to update to a new version and the updates fail with no real explanation other than to " close all programs and try again " . When I went to the support site I read way to many horror stories about the update , so I guess I 'm lucky it failed . And don't even think you 're going to get real support for this thing . Microsoft 's idea of support is user self service . They want us to read through pages and pages of user suggestions to find our fix . So I 'm not going to update , I 'll work with what I have . And when my Zune dies I 'll buy an iPod . And then I 'll replace my PC with a Mac . Then I will be free from the crappy software from Microsoft .  
1	  The camera was nice for the month it worked .. I got it for my graduation right before college and it never even made it to school . I went to an outdoor concert and was taking pictures when it started to drizzle . I put it in my purse immediately . It could not have gotten that wet , yet it began to act funky later that evening , the buttons were all doing different things than they were supposed to . For a while it only tuned on when it was plugged in and you hit the on button about five times , eventually it wouldn't turn on anymore . Because it was considered water damage the warranty wouldn't cover it and I 'm out a camera . The screen was great and the pictures it did manage to take were ok , but sometimes turned out pixely , not what I would have expected even from a 5.1 megapixel camera . Unless you are planning to have this camera encased in magical protective gear forever , I would avoid it .  
2	  I received these in the mail yesterday and took them out for a run on my Harley Road King last night . After a couple of practice runs putting them in I found they were exactly as described . They removed all of the wind noise I had found in other buds . The note they include in the package which says IMPORTANT is . I really needed to get them all the way into the canal to receive the required results . I ride without a windshield and the wind noise is really loud . These buds took the majority of it away . I had only had to use half of the volume I had used in the past and heard every note perfectly . WOW ! I would strongly recommend these to anyone one who desires to have the outside noise removed while listening to music . I found them a little uncomfortable when I inserted them the first time . I am not used to having something go that far into the ear canal . Also , it does help if you moisten them prior to inserting . But , the sound was worth the discomfort . After removing them when I stopped for coffee , the reinsertion was easier and the discomfort was milder . They take getting used to . Again , let me say if you ride and use buds , these are the ones for you .  
2	  I am in the process of installing this in a 1996 Honda Accord EX . Still waiting on a radio install kit . However , I hooked it up to make sure I had the right connections first . It was a very noticeable improvement over the stock player , even with the original speakers . It played CD 's very cleanly , and the radio reception was no problem . It has a " loud " button which accentuates the treble and bass , and the music was much better with this feature on . It 's a little " bassy " for a pure talk program , but all you have to do of course is press the " loud " button off . It also comes with a wafer-thin remote control , with mute button , if you feel you need it . CD 's go right into the front , with no flip-down face . It does of course have a detachable faceplate , with a case that came with it . It also comes with its own mounting bracket and removal key . It doesn't have an equalizer , but the music sounded very good anyway . If you want a basic cd / radio at a reasonable price , I would recommend this unit . A word about installation : very straight-forward for the do it your selfer . It is a single-din unit . I would recommend that you do get a wiring harness from Circuit City , etc . that fits your particular vehicle . That way you do not have to cut the original vehicle harness which could come in handy if you wish to replace the new unit or put the old one back in later . You may or may not want to get another harness which plugs into the new harness and then to your Panasonic . However , that 's another expense ( that you are going to be charged with at Circuit City , etc . which advertise " free installation , " but charge in the fine print for parts ) . I am going to hard-wire ( solder ) the new harness to the player 's harness with came with the unit . You can just use electrical tape of course for the connections , but I prefer to solder since electrical tape can become stiff , fall off , etc . on down the road . Using the harness adapter , the wires matched up by color code perfectly to the player 's harness . Depending on your vehicle , you may need to get a radio kit . Overall though , not hard at all .  
1	  At first I thought that this camera was wonderful BUT it has a lot of things wrong with it .. 1 . It is NOT for fast picture taking , it takes a lot of time for the shutter to close ! 2 . If you don't have an arm made of stone then you will get extremely blurry night shots . 3 . Goes through battery EXTREMELY quickly4 . There is a very slow rebooting time between shots5 . Zoom is choppy and hard to use6 . Only some of the photos come out when uploaded7 . Without the flash the pictures are very , very blurryBut this camera is extremely easy to use just take it out of the box and use it .  
1	  My DVD Player died after 4 months . It used to play everything . But one day suddenly it stopped playing and gave a message " Wrong Disc " . I faced the problem with remote functions . It always interfered with my Harman Kardon remote . When I operated my Harman Kardon remote , it used to behave funny . Very unreliable . I tried contacting customer support . But the email bounced back .  
1	  I bought one of these exactly a year ago . It was perfect for my needs . I loved it . Then one night I attempted to turn it on , and pfftthhtthht . The lights would come on , the fan would start , but it wouldn't boot up . I had tried everything recommended on the HP site , plus additional swearing and prayer . I checked for a solution online - surely , there must be something , right ? And there were hundreds , thousands of people who had bought the same computer , and about a year , 15 , 18 months in , were having the same thing happen . Turns out this is due to the defective GPU soldered right in the middle of the motherboard . Now , there was a BIOS update that caused the fan to run constantly , which postpones the inevitable until juusst after your warranty expires . I took mine to my main nerd to make a backup of my hard drive ( which I couldn't very well do after it died ) and he confirmed that " yeah , your motherboard is toasted . " But since this is a known defect in the NVIDIA chipset , HP will take care of you , right ? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH not really . Some people have had luck with case managers or appealing directly to the CEO , but most of us are SOL . They still won't acknowledge that this is a problem with this model . They will deny it to you directly , and claim to have never heard of such a thing . But , as you can see from the other reviews , there are a bunch of us sitting here with $ 1000 + paperweights , wondering whether HP still wants customers at all or not . So , if you want your heart broken , this is the machine for you !  
2	  I love it . I got it for my Mac Book Pro and It fits great like a well made glove . I really like all of low pro 's products and gear . I have many bags so I decided to keep the Low pro line from my camera bags to my Laptop bag . I highly recommend this bag / briefcase . built well and loos great and plenty of room for the charger and small book and 3 flash drives 5 business cards and a Droid cell phone :) !  
2	  I am very please with , you dont need to expend so much money on another cable this does the job .  
1	  Although this camera has outstanding features , such as the ability to edit and crop photo 's within the camera itself , I am very disapointed and plan on returning it after just 2 days . Having much experience with digital camera 's , indoor shots are much too dark on auto mode . Keep away if you expect good pictures with the auto mode . Also , delay too great in between shots , and very prone to blury exposures . Not too certain why it got such " good " evaluation , perhaps because the outdoor shots were much better . I will try the Canon next .  
2	  As the title states , I 'm not a massive audiophile . I love my music , sure , but I 'm not a purist . What I purchased this card to do , it does . See , I had a bit of a hardware issue when my 5 year old nephew decided to kick my printer off my computer desk , bringing it down on the audio plug on the back of my computer . It made the onboard audio out stop functioning . So , I replaced the onboard with a cheap , secondhand card given to me by a friend , but that card made it impossible to use my front audio ports . Then , I bought this card . It functions as my audio for both rear and front ports , so it does EXACTLY what I bought it to do . The setup process was easy , and the update process is a little tedious , if not time consuming , but the headphone jack on the front of my PC works again , so I 'm happy .  
1	  I bought this for my daughter for Christmas . It wasn't until I downloaded the software and it didn't work that I realized it is not compatable with Vista . I still don't see any mention of this on Amazon 's site . I sent an email to the manufacturer and they still have not replied . Basically it doesn't work at all for my daughter since all of my photos are on my Vista computer . I hope CTA enjoys the money I sent them more than I do the product they sent me .  
1	  It seemed to work great for one charge cycle and then never would fully recharge and supply power for more than a few seconds . A dismal failure , in my opinion . I would not recommend this or any similar Black & Decker product .  
1	  The screen is the exact size of my display area but the little sticky tabs they give with it are all but useless . You 'd do better with scotch tape to hold it in place . In my opinion a waste of money .  
2	  I don't know why so many people bash this product . If you have small ear canals , simply do not purchase these earphones , as they are not for you . However , if they do fit , I highly recommend you purchase these . The sound quality and clarity is very sharp and crisp . I have no idea why so many people complain of a " tinny " sound . These are the best sounding earphones I have used . The bass isn't amazing , but it 's reasonable . When I adjust my equalizer to " bass booster " it fixes the problem . All in all , a great product , very worth the money .  
2	  I have an Orion SkyQuest 6 , and this is the solar filter the company recommends . The fit is EXTREMELY snug . You 'll have to unscrew the mounts almost completely and kind of muscle the thing on . Taking it off is also tricky , as the foam rubber padding grabs a lot . I put my the filter between me and my body and pull with both hands . Anyway , about the image quality : Yes , you can see the sun in great detail ! I used my 25mm and 17mm Sirius Plossl eyepieces and saw about 5 or 6 sun spots . Each spot had a shape to it , but granular structures weren't very apparent ( which is expected from a scope this small . ) The Detroit area suffers from a fair amount of cloud cover , as well as heavy light pollution . Clear nights with little turbulence in the atmosphere are rare around here . Since the sun is large and bright in the sky , it 's less bothered by poorer viewing conditions . This filter was a great addition , as it allows me to get a lot more use out of my scope !  
2	  The saying has never been truer . As ugly as these headphones may look in their picture , they make up for it all in their sound . I see no point in detailing my experience , as there are already more than enough reviews here and elsewhere for you to read . Just know that , as a Sennheiser HD515 owner for three years now , these PortaPros sound scary-close in quality to those gigantic Sennheisers . As an added bonus , sound does not leak out nearly as much with these as with the HD515s . It really is remarkable . If you 're in the market for portable headphones , get these . If you 're in the market for headphones in this price-range , get these . The only thing that is a question mark right now for me is durability , but seeing that these headphones have been on the market unchanged for well over a decade ( not to mention the no-questions-asked warranty ) , I 'm not the slightest bit concerned about durability . Two thumbs up , five stars , grade A. This is one of those few products that you can't go wrong with .  
1	  yes , for 99 bucks the ipod shuffles does seem like a steal , but apple needs to stop portraying their products as simply ' disposable ' . E-waste is a serious issue and the fact that apple continues to produce and create new ipods that have irreplaceble batteries is not helping . it is not ok that if your ipod dies , u can simply throw it away and purchase a new one " for only $ 99 . " it does not make sense that apple charges you to replace the battery , nor does it make sense that they charge you if you want your ipod ' properly disposed of ' . please visit this site and learn how you can help : ww . badapple . bizi agree , apple is producing some of the coolest products ever , but why cant they do so while taking the problem of e-waste into consideration ?  
2	  Obviously this is an older product , and newer products have more and better features , nicer picture , and are cheaper . That being said , props to Samsung for delivering a product that has gotten used every day in my kitchen since I bought it 4 years ago , and is still working like the day I bought it . The newer TV 's will outshine this old girl , but she runs strong and really has a great picture . We watch this TV more than any other in the house , and the picture is bright even in the sunniest room !  
1	  I bought my Mitsubishi Widescreen TV in 1999 . I had a regular Sony dvd player for the next 2 years . I decided to go progressive in 2001 and purchased this unit . It was great and had the best picture ever . The full screens were adjusted to be full screen with black bars on the side which didnt bother me , and it kept it progressive . One drawback was the sound button , I believe its the VFP or Audio or something like that . Sometimes you get the movie with no sound or just music , so you have to go and manually set it to Theatre , Action or Cinema sound setting . That is a little annoying , since you figured you last set it so it should stay . The biggest problem is after a couple of years , with hardly any use at all , it stops playing after about 30 minutes like a previous reviewer mentioned . It starts garbaging and locking up , until it finally just freezes still and theres nothing you can do but shut it off . It looks to me like some kind of overheating problem . I really would like to get this fixed , but Im sure it might not even be worth the price . I paid $ 299 at the time for this in 2001 . It is probably worth $ 80 nowadays if that . But I have a new Pioneer DVD player now and it is great with all the latest DVDs , except the older ones . The fullscreen ones end up getting ' stretched ' and you cant change the settings to correct that . Even some widescreen ones in 2.35:1 get stretched , so you can imagine how ugly it looks , but new DVDs do look awesome . On the JVC , it would do all the adjusting for you perfectly . So Im stuck on whether I should get it fixed , and I also hear about the bad JVC customer service .  
2	  This " book holder " is a perfect stand for the Apple Ipad . It could have been designed for it . Sturdy , very adjustable , will hold the Ipad at various angles in either the vertical or landscape positions .  
2	  You can't beat the quality for the price . I 'm sure there is a difference between this cable and the $ 100 ones , but I can't see it .  
1	  I bought this card for my new Canon digital camera because SanDisk claimed it would reduce the wait time between pictures . Since I have two small children who rarely sit still for long , this was my highest priority in choosing a camera and memory card . However , this memory card actually made my camera have about twice the wait time between photos as it had with the small 16 MB card that was shipped with the camera ! Very disappointed and I plan to return it tomorrow .  
1	  Not a bad headset but as far as noise reduction .. nada . But as the old saying goes , you get what you pay for .  
2	  This product is solid , and it gave me no difficulty . It was perfect for hooking up to my roommate 's old tube tv . That being said , if you have an HDMI input on your TV , or whatever you 're linking up to , just get a DVI to HDMI converter . They 're about 10 to 20 bucks on NewEgg and will give you a much better picture than this will . ( Plus , most HDTV sets will talk to your computer and automatically set the display size when you use HDMI ; this product will not ) .  
2	  This is a freat multifunction printer but it is too expensive , I found the same product locally for $ 88 .  
2	  This is the best thing I have purchased in years ! I get to control what oil is used and how much of it ! It can also be used without oil at all . Its tastes great , batch after batch . The little inserts lasts a long time too . I use one for oil and one for without oil . I 'm on my 8th bowl of the oiled one and its still working fine though the user guide state I should change it around the 9th time . You will be happy with this one .  
2	  The product was useful to me and less expensive . Both cartridges worked properly . I 'll look forward to buy this type of combo always .  
1	  Obviously after paying to have a professional install for a new head unit , 60x4 amp , 4 door speakers and XM .. this unit did not compliment the other items very well at all . It will probably suffice standing alone with factory equipment but with any amount of volume above 50 % levels it distorts and was not worth the money spent for me . I was disappointed and am trying to return it .  
1	  I purchased this boombox for my daughter 's room . Basically , we put in a CD at bedtime , and set the sleep timer for 30 minutes . NOT heavy or detailed use .. I bought this unit because of the timer . After 3 months , when you push the play button ( either remote or manually ) the machine would sporadically play the CD . Usually after 2 or 3 ' no disc ' errors , and a power shutoff , it would eventually play . Now it 's completely a ' no disc ' error message . Of course , Sony 's warranty person explained that it 's a 90 day warranty .. imagine that ! A COMPLETE waste of my money . If I 'd have wanted a cheap machine to last a few months , I would have bought one . I paid extra for this one so it would last ! I 'll be hard pressed to buy Sony again !  
2	  Got this case for my mother after getting her a different one for her Nikon S8100 . I searched all the reviews and couldn't find any that people said were a good fit for the S8100 . Ended up getting this case at Target for ~ $ 16.50 ! .. would have been nice to get at Amazon 's nice price , but I WAS able to try it out live at Target AND get it to her that same day ( Special kudos to the sales guy who undid all the security attachments so we could completely try out the case ! ) . The case fits nice .. has the pocket outside for her spare battery .. and TWO zippers so that the camera strap can extend out of the case .. through the two zippers . The two zippers also make it easier to get the camera in and out .. the one I got first only had a small opening that you were supposed to squeeze the camera in and out through . Even though my mother won't use the belt strap .. that 's nice since it has a snap to connect around your belt .. without having to undo you belt to attach it .  
1	  I thought I was ordering a cable from Cables To Go but what I received was a cable from Cable Master . There are no markings on the cable telling me that it is CAT6 . If your going to buy this cable do not buy from Amamax .  
2	  I use the tape for cable labels mostly . Or other small parts or items . It sticks great and lasts in all temperatures , mostly . But is still easy to remove . Price could be a third less . :-)  
1	  This is the most profoundly flawed maching Apple has ever produced . If you look on CraigsList in any major city , you will find unfortunate " early adopters " putting them up for sale . Apart from the " gee whiz " factor of new technology , bright screen and cool styling , it is virtually useless as a modern computer . 1 . HEAT : my MBP was so hot I could not keep my hands on the laptop or keypads . In fact the underside MELTED PLASTIC . That means it can coaglulate protein ( i.e. burn flesh ) before long . This is well documented by unhappy users all over the web and hundreds of powerbooks have been replaced . Supposedly there are " cool " machines out there , or maybe only people with very cold hands . The machine should have never been released with this unresolved heat issue . 2 . NOISE : there are 3 or 4 intolerable noise issues on these computers . I have had all of them , and all are , again , well documented on discussion groups . There is a high-pitched whine on the right side of the computer when the powercord is not plugged in ( supposedly the screen inverter ) . There is the " mooing " or " distant buzz saw " sound , either of fans or processers happening at various times . And when the heat gets high enough , very irritating buzzing fans can be heard in any quiet room-across the room ! 3 . SLEEP ISSUES : screen black on coming out of sleep , refuses to wake up , complete crash ( automatic restart ) on coming out of sleep . 4 . USB ; various incompatibilities ( as reported on discussion groups ) . For example , on all my printers , I now have to go into sleep mode , or even restart the computer completely , in order to have my printer be recongized by the computer . 5 . SLOW : this is MUCH SLOWER than previous powerbooks , because of non-native applications .. i.e. ALL THE IMPORTANT ONES . If you use InDesign , Photoshop , etc . be prepared for spinning beach balls .. as much as THREE TIMES longer for certain actions , including opening a document ! Adobe Support told me directly : " We do not support ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS that are running on a MacBookPro . We did not hear about them until you guys did .. we had no prior warning . " But also even finder activites , lke ejecting a connected firewire drive , are slower and sluggish . Changing applications takes forever . INSTABILITY.Many more crashes , hangs and forced quits than the same software and OS software running on my old G4 . SERVICEApple has done everything to deny all the above and make it difficult for users to get any kind of satisfaction , relief or resolution . In short , the once user friendly Apple has finally matched the arrogance and diffidence of Microsoft and Quark . Save yourself a lot of grief friends , and stay away from the MacBookPro debacle !  
2	  I was having problems reading SDHC Cards on my SD readers , but no problem using my camera . So I scoured all the sites for a good deal on SDHC readers . I was dumbfounded about the inexpensive price that included the Extreme II cards . I have purchased two 2GB Extreme II cards that are great . I can take 3 shots / second with this card . Incredible stop action pics for tennis and football . The card reader is smaller than my old one I loved , what a plus . It takes the SDHC without a hitch . It comes with a groovy holder that protects the reader and card . This one is definitely a photographer 's friend . I wholeheartedly recommend this combo and I would like to thank everyone that has written reviews on Amazon because I come here first .  
1	  It was offered as an accessory to the Panasonic phone that I had purchased , but on receiving the items the phone and the headset were not compatible . So make sure you check clearly before you buy , just because it is offered as an accessory does not necessarily mean it is compatible .  
1	  What a nightmare . I 'm going to declare it a national holiday when I return this item . Do a Google search online before you buy this item . You will see endless calls for help over missing drivers , challenges with installing software using XP , etc . I have considerable computer experience . Yet after I bought this All-in-One unit last weekend I spent 14 hours on the phone w / HP tech support and endless hours trying fixes of my own . They all gave me a different story . Then turned me over to the laptop division of HP saying it must be a problem w / my laptop . The laptop division , SURPRISE , sent me back to the printer division . I 've tried all the ' fixes ' , ordered a new installation disk , reintalled software many times , new USB cable . Nadda . Still junk . Save yourself the frustration . I am keeping my old ' print only ' printer . It 's plug and play . If you have Windows XP Professional , this unit will NOT necessarily be ' Plug and Play . ' Time to go give my old reliable printer a hug . The software , by the way , is a complete memory hog and takes forever to install .  
1	  I am the fourth review and the third to complain that the tray bezel won't fit my computer case . The tray won't even open because the idiots at Pioneer decided to make the front of the tray be as big as the entire drive ! Very poor engineering . I wish that I could tell you how it performs but I have to take it back without even getting a chance to see the tray open . And the worst part of it is that there was absolutely no need for the drive to be designed this way . They were simply trying to make it look " pretty " . Fools .. they are going to be getting a lot of drives returned .  
1	  Not sure how many people who have vista got this thing to work ; but count one more who didn't . Pretty annoying such a simple piece of hardware can't work on a widely popular OS .  
2	  Since I have multiple sets of headphones and a phone headset with a cord , buying three cord managers in one made sense . Because this product is not in the shape of something silly like a rabbit or fish , the cord manager doesn't look tacky . It 's simple , keeps my headphones from getting tangled or catching on things , and the price is inexpensive .  
1	  I recently purchased a Harmony 670 remote to control a Denon AVR 2308CI Audio Visual receiver and a Sony KDL 52W3000 LCD TV . The remote replaces a MX500 programmable remote which was clunky and not well received by my family . The physical remote is appealing . The initial online setup was simple . The big flaw is in the implementation . The remote never properly changed the input on my audiovisual receiver despite the fact that the receiver was listed on the Harmony setup pull down list . The receiver has a " DVR " output which is not readily visible on the remote . The database is NOT flawless . Tech support is pleasent but useless . Three hours later .. still no success . Potential buyers should be aware that the browser setup is NOT , at least in my experience , a panacea ! Be prepared for hassles and judge value accordingly . I have easily spent more of my time trying to make the remote work than my time is worth for other things . I continue to spend the time because there are few alternatives . If you have little time to spend .. hire a home AV person to " give you a remote " Amazon may just get this one back ! I will try a little more .  
1	  This scanner and software is fine if you only use XP , but I bought this 2 years ago , about the time Vista was coming out so I thought HP would make it compatible with Vista . No such luck , HP wrote the software for XP and then dumped support . They half attempted to write a driver for Vista but it is slow and you can't use HP software , so now I have to stay with XP . This will probably be my last HP purchase .  
1	  I got this product because it seemed that the industry was moving away from CD 's and toward these MP3 / ipod / WMA players , and I didn't want to wake up one morning and find that all my painstakingly collected music was unplayable . But was I ever in for a shock ! This product is nowhere NEAR ready for prime time , and is unacceptable on almost every conceivable level . Without going into detail on any of my complaints about the device itself ( it doesn't even have an on-off switch , let alone an equalizer ) , the most infuriating problem is the software . You can't just load tracks from your computer and be done with it - not by a long shot . You have to KEEP those tracks where the device found them the first time they were " synced , " otherwise every one of those tracks will be deleted from the device the next time the device is connected to your computer - and you have no option about this ! Many people have posted online complaints about this bug , and Microsoft has apparently sent out a squad of cybergoons to defend the indefensible , calling users " stupid " if they want to delete those tracks from their hard drives . ( Or if they happen to accidentally erase the tracks . Or if they want to connect the Zune device to a different computer that doesn't have those tracks . Or if they want to keep the same tracks in a different folder and / or in a different format Or if they want to offload the files to a DVD or other storage device . All those are really stupid ideas , aren't they ? ) That " feature " alone makes the Zune system unacceptable , but that 's just the tip of the iceberg . While trying to " sync " tracks from my hard drive to the Zune device , many of the tracks were rejected . And , in keeping with the total incompetence of the Zune software , there was no error message generated at the time telling me that the attempt to load the tracks had failed . I only found out about it when I went to a screen that listed the tracks that had been loaded , and found that many were missing . So then I went to still a THIRD screen ( The Zune software is nearly impossible to navigate , BTW ) and found a list of tracks that had been " skipped " in my attempt to load them . I right-clicked on one of the tracks and discovered that there was an error code associated with the problem . However the software had no idea what the error code meant and directed me to the " Zune Help " website . What was the website 's solution ? " Unfortunately , there is no specific Web Help message for this error yet . " It then directed me to a forum to see whether anyone there had a suggestion . This forum was a real eye-opener . I posted my problem on the forum only two days ago , and since that time there have been SEVEN PAGES of new postings , every one of them complaining of some new Zune software problem . Furthermore , the forum apparently has space enough for only seven pages of postings - which means only two days ' worth - and anything beyond that just rolls off into outer space . And since Microsoft itself has no solution to offer , this device for which I paid $ 200 is essentially useless . I should add that there is no user 's manual , and that the Zune software has no help function or help file . There is a website that calls itself a Zune user 's manual , but it is as difficult to navigate as the Zune software itself - and that 's saying something . It has no systematic explanation of how to accomplish even the most basic tasks , and makes constant references to menus and links that don't exist on the current version of the software . Stay away ! This product is as unprofessional and unacceptable as any product could possibly be .  
1	  I was very excited after I ordered and received the My Book Pro II . I set it up to use RAID mirroring . Unfortunately , within two months , one of the hard drives inside failed on me . I was hoping that Western Digital drives had become more reliable in the years since I last used them and wrote them off , but I have been disappointed on that front . I am going back to Seagate , as their drives have performed much more reliably for me .  
1	  with only 600 sheets printed and [ a decent amount of money ] per cartridge , that 's . 05 cents per sheet . Too expensive . Funny , because my Lexmark printer only cost [ a little bit more ] and came with both a b / w and color cartridge .  
1	  I don't blame Amazon for carrying this item but have already communicated directly to Kodak . This kit is misrepresented ! We needed to replace an older model dock station that no longer transferred pictures . This is the correct replacement but no where on the box or in the description does it tell you that the CABLE , a necessity , is not included ! The kit contains a camera bag ( NOT NEEDED and didn't want it .. I have one and I was not ordering a camera ! ) Kit also includes lens cleaning solution and a cleaning cloth , plus rechargeable batteries .. ALSO NOT NEEDED ! ) The box makes mention that perhaps one can use their former cable .. OUR former cable was not compatible with this new kit ! Had to order a separate cable , which in itself was rather inexpensive but could have easily been included in the kit if they had eliminated the useless camera bag , cleaning supplies + batteries !  
2	  Sony KDL-40V2500 40 " Bravia V-Series 1080p LCD HDTVI am very pleased with the product and the price . I did have to track the shipment and call when it was late and apparently stuck in an intermediate city but that was resolved quickly and the service was very good .  
1	  After receiving the item i immediately tested them . the sound quality was horrible . its as if you were in an underwater cave and all u hear is the bass . Also , they are quite difficult to get into your ears , like honestly who thought of these things .  
1	  The part I received does not work but but to get it replaced I have to pay to ship it back and include a check for shipping of a replacement . After paying shipping 2 more times I will have had to pay for this thing twice , and there 's still no guarantee the 2nd part will function properly . I 've decided to cut my losses and throw the remote away . Don't waste your money . They obviously don't have very good quality control and an even worse warranty policy .  
1	  I agree with another comment that the button on the side of the handle is to easy to accidentally press and change the mode unknowingly . When using with the Canon PowerShot S3 IS , I found it doesn't work with the manual settings I prefer . You have to still use the pop-up flash to trigger the slave . Maybe a diffuser to eliminate the effects of the pop-up will impove the results . While it does what it said it would do , in order to do what I want to do , I need to upgrade my whole system . If I want to be professional , I need a professional system . This is okay for now while I 'm getting my studio business back up and running .  
1	  I have a Belkin Pre-N network at my house and liked the specs on the new Linksys product ( WMP300N PCI adapter and the WRVS4400n router and access point ) for my office . Out of the box nothing worked . An upgrade to . 13 firmware in the router at least got it working . Speeds are impressive , but as many others have noted , the system hangs up at random times driving users to distraction . I returned the product and reinstalled my Cat 6 cables . Once Linksys gets the bugs out I 'll try them again , but they released this product without enough testing , in my opinion . This is a classic example of buyer beware .  
1	  I bought this player at Target because it was the cheapest one . Next time price won't be my first priority . Its only been two weeks and it skips frequently and freezes up often . I can't believe this company gets away with it .  
1	  it worked once then that was it , never to be recharged again went back to original battery that still worked but only for a half hour . took much hassel to return .  
2	  This product arrived in a timely manner , contained treats , and is a great bargain . Thanks !  
1	  I got to the Amazon . com site through a direct link from SimpleTech 's website . The Amazon . com site does not provide any technical info on the module-and the great price is due to the fact that it is not the RAMBUS module you think you 're getting , but an SDRAM module that is NOT compatible with the Gateway 700se / 1.8-2.0mhz . I have just sent the module back to Amazon . com , requesting a refund . Their top-notch customer service usually comes through with snafus like this ..  
2	  Unlike the typical kit lens , this lens has a fixed focal length . It also has the possible drawback in that it works best when manually focused . That being said , you won't find a sharper , faster macro or portrait lens for any camera let alone anything in the Olympus line . If you have a four thirds system camera ( Olympus , Leica , etc . ) and want to work close , this is well worth the trouble to learn how to use it .  
2	  I have purchased one of these and I got really very well impressed with the overall image quality . I bought one but I end up returning and changing to a 52247 model . This spotting scope is somehow bigger than it appears in the picture . I had an idea of the size based on the ocular but this oculuar is bigger that the average . But it is not heavy though and its size is comparable to a tripoid size . So this shouldn't be such problem in terms of portability in many cases . The ocular can be unscrewed to prevent damages during transportation and it has an o-ring for waterproofing . The lens shade is not extensible and it has an 80mm thread for filters .  
2	  Panasonic has reached perfection to put in your pocket with this DMC-LZ5 camera . This small , yet easy-to-hold 6 MP , 6X-optical zoom digital camera takes excellent quality photos of especially good color reproduction . The zoom is very powerful . The camera starts up in less than 5 seconds . It has the least amount of shutter-lag , about 1-2 seconds , that I 've experienced . It takes sequential photos with such speed that you can keep on clicking and get moving objects with clarity . It has anti-shake technology . It exhausts my rechargeable batteries within about 10-15 photos . It takes two AA batteries . So one needs to maintain a supply of charged batteries . It holds the settings when changing batteries and when turned off ( when you select the no-reset option ) . The camera does not have a viewfinder , but its 2.5-inch screen is quite satisfactory and shows the selected view clearly and accurately . Its size diagonally is 2 7/8 inches . I am very impressed with the fine detail and the so-realistic reproduction of scenes that you may think you are looking at the real object , and the color reproduction . The blues and greens , as well as the reds and yellows , are stunning . It takes photos close-up to about 6 to 8 inches in focus and with wonderful clarity . It has a superb fold-over lens cover to protect the lens while the camera is turned off . So you don't have to worry about lens damage or losing the lens cover . I found the camera very easy to acquire a working knowledge of without the manual , which was not much help . With a 128 MB secure digital memory card I can take about 600 photos at a 640X480 setting . The only downfall ( s ) are : The manual with it , like most electronics / camera manuals , fails to give complete instructions . The sections do not start at the beginning by telling you which settings or mode to be in when following the instructions . The manual I have seems to be geared to another model of camera . For instance , when I tried to find the 640 X 480 setting , the camera did not select pixels that way , but rather by 3M , 2M , 1M , . 3M , and the chart did not convert to that means of measuring pixels . The Panasonic " simple viewer " software is not simple . It apparently has a special driver necessary to view or upload photos , which did not transfer to my PC . However , there are three different software programs on the accompanying CD , one of which is an excellent ArcSoft program that I found easy to use and very complete . Also there is an Adobe software program on the CD . All-in-all , I recommend this camera to the Amazon . com readers . The price is reasonable for all that it packs into it . You will be very happy with this camera whether you are a weekend birdviewing fan , a parent wanting to memorialize a baby or a child in play , or are using the camera for commercial or professional reasons . Just be prepared with a plentiful supply of charged batteries . May 6 , 2007 , UPDATE : After over a year of use , this camera has become my favorite and most used camera . My comments above , first written last year , remain my opinion of this perfect camera . I found that Radio Shack rechargeable AA batteries hold charges longest . I discovered this camera 's excellent " motion picture mode " , which you use by turning a dial on top of the camera and then clicking the picture-takng button to activate and clicking again to stop . It takes SD media cards . With a 1G or 2G card , you have plenty of SD storage for both stills and motion pictures . I like to take motion pictures of surfers , pelicans diving for dinner in Santa Monica Bay , and wrapearound views of my rose and blue-lavender bearded irises . The colors are vibrant . My one difficulty is viewing images on the LCD screen in bright daylight . At under $ 200 now , this camera is a great bargain with all its features .  
1	  I picked up one of these units for work . I checked it out thouroughy and it seemed OK . I am a techie and have long work and personal issues with D-Link products . If they work , they work OK . If they do not work , you are on your own . Turns out that this unit is listed as " compatible " with all versions of Windows , including Vista . In reality , this is not true and it will not work with Windows 64 bit . I contacted D-Link tech support 3 times in early february via e-mail and phone ( not in the manual , had to dig on the net ) and they still have not responded . pay a little more $ and buy a slightly more expensive unit that has support .  
2	  I purchased two pair of headphones for my 3- and 4-year-old children . We have wireless headphones for the dvd player in our van , but my son pulled off the ear padding on both sets . I love the padding on the Kidz Gear b / c they won't come off . Also , the kids have Leapsters , which come with earbuds . However , they have a hard time keeping them in their ears . The Kidz Gear headphones are perfect for this . The only downside is that the headphones have cords . But , that is how they are advertised . The cords are plenty long enough to use in the van , but they do hang down from the dvd player . We just have to remind the kids to be careful with them . Overall , this is a great product , especially for the price .  
1	  I initially gave this product a great 5-star review . Now it 's been 3 months since I started using it and it stopped working and the water didn't turn off like it should have . What a mess and what a piece of junk !  
1	  This product is exactly what it is . While a nice addition to use , in my estimation to sensative to the slightest sound . keybord stokes , my touching even the desk it sat on tranmitted that sound . also even adjusting the stand it sits on was noisy . If you want just something to talk with or have fun , this product is ok . If you want more serious voice transmision , I 'd pass on this one !  
2	  This is a top quality printer that makes excellent prints that have an expected life of 100 years using separate ink cartiridges so that only individual inks need to be replaced instead of all the inks when one runs out as found in some of the cheaper printers . The cheaper printers such as the Epson 820 will give similar lookingprints that will not last as long . I like the printer better than some of the other more expensive printers like the Hewlett-Packard 7960 ( which I also own ) . This printer only makes prints that are 8.5 inches wide although it can make panoramic prints that are 8.5 by 23.3 inches in the standard size included with the printer . If you want wider prints , Epson has now introduced the R1800 printer using the same cartridges as the R800 printer ( a minor miracle ) .  
2	  I purchased the Motorola Surfboard SB5101 Cable Modem along with a Linksys WRT54G2 Wireless Router to replace a Linksys Cable Modem / Wireless Router that was constantly dropping out . Since installing this new equipment , I have not had a single loss of network conductivity - what a pleasure not have to reset and restart everything 2-3 times per day . This combination of 2 devices is obviously not as convenient as having an all in one unit , but what really counts is performance .  
2	  I purchased two more of these to go with a black pair that I already had when my Apple earbuds gave out on one side . My previous pair I usually keep in my personal laptop bag for when I travel , as I 'm notorious for forgetting mine when I travel . I can't begin to tell you how many really cheap earbuds I have purchased over the years . I liked the JVC Gumys because the rubbery covering helps keep it in my ear , which is the biggest grip I had with the original Apple earbuds . However , as I only used them on travel I didn't get all of the ends and outs of this product . The thing that I like about them , the gummy coating , is also the same reason why I curse them . I 've found that the gummy material causes the cord to catch on anything that it comes in contact with and thus pulls them out of my ear . Argh ! I noticed one person on the subway that had a pair and he wore his under his shirt . I guess that 's one way to keep it from catching on stuff . As for the sound , they sound OK . Not great , but not bad either . All in all it 's hard to go wrong with these given the low price . I 've had more expensive stuff that hasn't worked nearly as well .  
1	  I was really excited about this product and thought I had finally bought the perfect gift for my husband . This was supposed to be his father 's day gift , however , when he loaded the pictures onto the keychain , the pictures were so dark that you couldn't even see them . I 'm not sure if this is typical or if I got a defective keychain , but either way , we were both really disappointed . I would not recommend or buy this product again .  
2	  To start , I am very familiar with high-end home theater systems , as I 've spec 'd and installed systems from modest-budget systems to $ 16K systems . I personally own a fairly nice home theater / music system . I bought the Koss based on other customer reviews for a friend who just recently moved into a studio apartment . For approx . $ .. , I am truly astounded by the decent quality of the audio and video . The vocals are clear and intelligible . It performs acceptably well for those Hollywood " WOW " action scenes . Stereo playback of CD 's sound far better than anything else in its price range . Can it compare to systems costing thousands more ? No . But it certainly holds it 's own to systems costing hundreds more . Installation was simple . After breaking open the box , I had the whole system connected and placed in 10 minutes . The connections are all well-labeled and color coded . The satellite speakers even come with threads to accept placement using any off-the-shelf universal wall-mount , which is how I setup the surrounds . Remember , this whole audio system , including integrated amp and tuner , costs less than many DVD players alone ! So what are my nitpicks ? Well , system setup of the speakers is buried in the on-unit menu system , and setting the clock is a pain because I had to dig through the manual to find the directions , which ended up being slightly confusing . As with all systems , to make the most out of its capabilities , speaker / sub placement needs to be carefully done , especially with the limited capability of the " sub " to ensure that it doesn't sound too boomy . When compared to a class higher in quality , the sound is too accentuated in the midrange , while the bass could do with considerably more articulation and the highs could be more detailed . Though overall , especially considering the price , I can't imagine a better home-theater / music system value for $ .. A very surprising 5 stars !  
2	  I installed this kit in my 1996 Chrysler Cirrus . No problems with the install and the product worked as designed . Only complaint is the crimp connector ends were too big for the gauge of wire used .  
1	  Thought this was going to be a great deal for the price .. it has very limited volume control . Lowest setting is too quiet , next setting up is too loud . Also , no radio presets . Not worth the money spent , will be returning to store ..  
2	  Didn't have a problem with these cables . I made one run of about 30-50 feet , and as soon as I crimped everything , the connection worked with no problems . I did a lot of twisting and bending of the cable for my run too , so I think it 's safe to say that it withstood the rough treatment .  
2	  While I have been very impressed with this unit 's features , I think it can't be stated enough for prospective buyers , this unit comes with an essentially worthless basemap that does NOT offer street routing . Expect to spend an additional 130 $ to make the unit useful in your car for routing . Otherwise , I highly recommend the 60CSx . My first GPS and it 's packed full of easily learned features .  
1	  I was so happy when I purchased the Kensington 33199 Digital FM transmitter and Auto Charger . Within two days after I received it , I became sick to my stomach . The darned thing fried my IPOD Nano . I read the reviews before I purchased and it seemed to be exactly what I wanted . I had returned two earlier purchased products that I got from Walmart , because there was too much noise , and while in the city I could not even find a good FM channel with no drift and fade . This product certainly delivered there . But I did not see any warning that I could not leave the product plugged in with my IPOD attached . The third time that I turned it on , it played for about a minute and then stopped . I looked down just in time to see the battery ICON in the IPOD disappear and I knew that my IPOD was fried . I was so happy after purchasing the tuner that I had thrown out all the shipping material . Foolishly . Now I can't even return the product , I am sure that they won't take it back . I learned a hard lesson . But you don't have to make that mistake .  
1	  Don't waste your time with this product . It isn't that the device is bad , it 's actually pretty good , but the software is the worst and keeps getting worse with every new release and update . To show you how bad this software is , Microsoft has an entire web site devoted to trouble shooting problems ! Instead of developing the web site , maybe they should should 've made a better effort on the software . If you don't mind headaches , wasted hours , and never getting the program to work correctly , then by all means buy this . Otherwise I suggest the iPod . The higher price is worth it .  
2	  Excellent sound ( for all but the audiophile who writes a review below ) . Most people consider the sound better than the Onkyo CS210 . The one problem is with the reliability of the CD changer , whose door sometimes gets stuck and requires service . Thus if you 're going to buy this machine , you might want to consider a warranty extension . Despite this problem , no one has suggested to me an equally good machine in this price range for rich sounding music in a small room . This machine also has a hidden use : as a headphone-only system . Many rather expensive stereos have mediocre headphone output . Here , however , the headphone output is outstanding even with demanding headphones . I use headphones a lot and simply can't justify buying a headphone amplifier when this is so good .  
2	  Got this in conjunction with a Boss R1100 250W rms amp and an 8 & # 34 ; pyle subwoofer tube . I recommend all these for cheapskates who want to add some nice bass . The only issue I had was with my ground connection , but that was just because I picked a bad spot to put it the first time . Turns out a good ground is kind of important , who knew ? :) For a non-superpowered amp this kit should be totally fine . Why pay more ?  
1	  Purchased from Amazon on February 12 , 2007 . I used it for 3 years with some minor problems . When there were problems , I had to unplug this device and plug the USB device directly to the back fo the computer . However , recently it stopped working completely . Whenever I plug a USB device , it gives me a message saying the device hub is overloaded . When I plug the device directly to the computer , there is no problem . This happens when used with the power adapter ( obviously ) and with only ONE USB device being connected . I am not certain if 3 years is an acceptable life for electronic components ; it is not acceptable to me personally . I expect all my electronic purchases to survive a minimum of ten years . An expensive SONY MP3 CD player I purchased died after 17 months . So I completely stopped buying SONY products due to unreliable product life . I have had other problems with other LINKSYS devices , so I am begining to form a low opinion of this company 's products as well , and its product documentation tends to be very user unfriendly in general .  
2	  I have given up my mouse . This is an extremely satisfying interface of ergonomic functionality and intuitive thinking . I have only one question .. why did I wait so long ? If you are making a living in the digital graphics world this is about as useful as it gets . The learning curve is brief and the rewards many , pressure sensitive , natural hand movements etc . I recommend this product highly .  
1	  If you think you are going to be able to use the Jornada to pick up email from your company server while out of the office , think again . Although the manual says you can set it up to do this , the techs at HP don't have a clue about how to make it work . After paying the best technical guy I know for a full day 's time , he also couldn't make it work . If you remember to leave your desktop computer on , you can pick up email in the Active Sync mode . But if you forget , you 're out of luck . This seems to be due to the fact that Windows CE , like many Microsoft products , just has too many bugs . The Jornada is NOT ready for prime time . Save your money and get a ligthweight laptop that runs Windows 95 if you want to be in touch while on the road .  
2	  I had one of these where I worked and it 's now great to have one for play . I love the size of the body and the quality of the images . I recommend this to any amateur looking to step it up .  
1	  I agree totally with the above review - it simply does not " play " in a Sony 8mm camcorder . I tried it in both of mine , and all it did was pull the " tape " out of the shell and jam , requiring a manual removal as it did for the other reviewer . I don't know how we are going to clean these heads , now that the Sony dry cleaner is no longer available .  
1	  quick shipment . Useless product . Needed a ps / 2 to usb " signal " converter not a plain ps / 2 to usb adapter . was cheaper to just buy a new keyboard for 6 bucks .  
2	  Recommendation : I 'd buy this if you want this particular combination of features . But to get the features there are large compromises in performance . In this review , I will mention the Gecko 201 , Quest , and Vista C. These are other units made by Garmin . I own a 201 and a Quest ( early version ) but have not yet used the other unit or the later Quest 's . Driving : When placing it on the dash I am forced to compromise between seeing the display and aiming the antenna outside of the car for reception , since the antenna is in the body of the unit . The effect depends on the design of the car ( how big the windows are , I would guess . ) On the Quest , the antenna flips up and it does not have this problem . Sunlight reflecting off the front face of the unit into the driver 's eyes is sometimes a problem , and aiming to unit to fix this can compromise reception and / or readability . The battery life is short enough that I find a car plug necessary ( at additional cost ) . However , the battery life can be extended by disabling features . It is not able to find automobile routes , such as the Vista C or Quest can do . I find that when I compare the cost of a Vista ( plus maps and plug ) with , say , a Quest ( where these are included ) , they are pretty much the same . So I would not get a Vista if the only planned use was extensive route finding while driving . The Quest is a much better solution . Hiking : I live in California . Here there are grassy hills to tree covered hills . I find that my main area of concern is finding my location when in the trees since in other areas I can navigate with a map ( the GPS does not rule out needing a map , even with the topo map CDs ) and my eyes . I have been comparing the reception of the Vista with my Gecko 201 , and find that the 201 gets noticably stronger signals . This results in the 201 getting faster , better positions , and getting positions where the Vista will not , such as in moderate tree cover , which is where I 'd really want a position . I find that e-compass and e-altimeter do not outweigh the fact I cannot get a position lock . So if your only planned use is hiking , I 'd get something with better reception , and a Silva " Ranger " style compass . I am finding that when I switch on / off the compass feature ( to save battery life , the compass is a noticable drain ) the software in the unit crashes and it shuts off . A pain , but not a fatal one . However , all the preceeding being said , if you want a single unit that can get you to a park , then navigate around the park , and back to the car , this unit is cheaper that two separate GPS units for each aplication . And it nicely fits into a pocket for hiking . I also hear that geocachers like them since they need to get close to the cache in the car , and then take the unit out of the car to find the cache . I could see this unit being nice in that application .  
2	  Great product . The big CON is the Garmin policies about their databases and their _ very _ poor support . I bought a microSD City Navigator and I can't register it ( the site doesn't allow it ) and I can't backup it ( copying the files doesn't work ) . The Garmin support gave me at least 10 different answers about this but no solution for the problem . If I lose the chip or it gets damaged ( as happened a few months ago with another chip ) I will have nothing . Also _ very _ bad is the fact that you can not update any info in the card . And there are many small errors ( things are constantly changing ! ) . - The compass and altimeter have to be calibrated to be reliable . - The unit is not water proof and doesn't floatIf you 're not considering using Garmin maps / cityNavigators , it 's a very good choice . If you need Garmin 's maps / cityNavigators , prepare youself to be frustated with very bad support and many small errors that you can not fix .  
1	  I received this item in a state of disrepair . It does not work . Thank you .  
2	  hey , let me tell you that these speakers are a real deal , big soundfrom a small box , i wasn't sure about getting these babys or the polks for 70 bucks more , so i risked it and got the sony 's i 've read reviews saying that they dont have bass ! thats a lie ! im using them as my main speakerswith a sony receiver and a technis equalizer and they hit loud and clear with planty of bass ( people be realistic please they are not 15 " subwoofers , don't spect them to tear down the house . that 's why you use a subwoofer ) why spend alot of money on just a brand name ( like bose ) if you are short on cash like me get these speakers , im sure you 'll love them . my  
1	  This is one of the worst monitors I 've ever encountered . It is very blurry . It turned itself off then reappeared with the most horrible blurry screen I 've ever seen ! I rebooted my machine and it returned to normal .. only to do it again 20 minutes later ! STAY AWAY FROM THIS MONITOR ! I am a computer professional .. I have seen many monitors .. this is by far the WORST . ALSO take not its not flat at all .. Viewsonice put a flat piece of glass in front of the CURVED tube to FOOL you !  
1	  latch case broke within 2 weeks , when opened the palm starts sliding out if you 're not careful . don't buy it .  
1	  I can never leave this printer alone when faxing with the feeder , or printing . Jams on both ends , so much I wanted to pitch this thing out of the window ! Has suddenly decided not to scan anymore manually . I have to set it up to scan now from the computer for it to work . I have seen some great print quality from hp , and am considering a move today !  
1	  The Panasonic SLSX289V portable CD player is the poorest machinery I 've ever experienced using . It easily malfunctions when you put in a CD recordable disc , and there is no anti-shock button on the CD player , to prevent it from skipping . When I had to get this product fixed , Panasonic didn't do anything about it . Basically all that I got from this CD player , was a [ $ ] AM / FM radio . What a waste of good money . If you 're looking for a good portable CD player with a radio , get the Aiwa XP-R220 .  
2	  I am brand new to the world of iPods . My wife bought me one . I wanted to be able to hook it up to my home stereo and to charge it without plugging it into the computer . This solved both problems and was affordable .  
2	  As many of reviewers have noted here , usual brick and mortar stores sell these cables on the borderline of " rip-off " states . For the price I 've paid for these cables , it 's well worth the money . I primarily used the cable for connecting my laptop to my printer . It functions as well , no problems as well . The connector head on both the laptop side and the printer side are of higher quality .  
2	  Purchased cables to extend our security camera system 's reach . Works great ! Great value for the money !  
2	  So far I have really enjoyed using this lens . I 'm still playing around with it and have a lot to learn but I 've been super happy with it so far  
1	  I purchased the CyberHome 1500 and their player 300 at the same time expecting that I could use the recorder in the family room and the player in the kids ' bedroom . The recorder DOES NOT WORK . I have had difficulty playing purchased DVDs , recording DVDs and playing back the couple of DVDs that I was able to record . It turns itself off during recording , it freezes up while playing a recorded or a store bought DVD . CyberHome will not respond to their customer service either on line or via phone . SAVE YOUR MONEY DON'T BUY THIS . Mine is going back today .  
1	  We are also victims of this faulty TV scenario . Purchased the Zenith Z50PX2D 50 in . HDTV Plasma Television almost 3.5 years ago . Paid over $ 3000 + was told this type of tv ( at Best Buy ) has a life 10 + years . Experienced a loud pop 2x ( almost equal to the sound of car backfiring ) and the picture goes blank . Was told by a tech that it \ 's possibly the Y or Z sus . board . This is a common reoccuring prob . with this particular model . These are all faulty parts that NEED TO BE RECALLED ! The manufacture should at the VERY least send us replacement parts at no charge and we will pay the labor ! Was turned down after numerous calls to customer service . IF THIS TELLS YOU ANYTHING-THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON THIS PARTICULAR MODEL ON THE [ .. ] SITE !  
1	  I had a Hewlett Packard 540 printer from 1994 and that works better than the 1300 . I have put 20 year old pieces of paper , used , recycled , and I never had a problem with the 540 that I do with a 1300 . I work in a school office and I have had nothing but problems with removing jammed paper . If it 's stuck somewhere and you need to remove it , but it is impossible without damaging the rollers to prevent the paper jam in the machine . Somehow I think Hewlett Packard lost its way in making printers . Since I work in an office , it is impossible to really depend on the 1300 printer for assurance . Once there is a jam and a crackling sound , get ready to buy a new printer . It is very important for people who design printers to place emphasis on using recycable paper and the printer 's longevity . For now , I have a 540 at home which has lasted over 10 years without needing service . There tells me something is wrong with this picture when an old printer like 540 is better than a 1300 ten years later . Something is wrong with the price . I would not spend so much money on a printer that will break after a few months . If you need a dependable productive printer , this is thenot one .  
2	  This skin fits the 30GB or newer small profile 60GB Zen Vision W. Won't be much use if you drop the unit , but works great to protect it from scratches . Improves the grip on the unit which I 've found a little slippery at times . If you want a nice inexpensive case for the Zen , most cases designed for the PSP work great .  
1	  I have an after market handle that serves as a lift for my computer to allow the bottom of it to breath , but it still doesn't cool it enough , and the fans still come on . So , I thought the Notebook Cooler might do the trick . One of the features that I was excited about were the really quiet fans that are supposed to blow away the heat from the bottom of the computer . Well , the fans aren't quiet , and it doesn't cool off my computer . In fact , the fans were as loud , or louder than my notebook 's fans . It also isn't very smart . You have to turn it on and off manually , instead of having a sensor that detects heat . The fans are loud , the internal design is lacking , and it really doesn't cool off the computer that much . In fact , it just blows warm air towards you if you 're sitting next to it . About the only thing that 's good about this is the aesthetic design . It 's cool looking , but not worth your money or your time .  
1	  Do not buy this item if you plan to use it continuously . It fell apart after about 2 months of use ( 50 plug-in plug-out cycles ) . It worked well originally , but soon the HDMI part of the adapter started bending and eventually fell out .  
2	  I have had mine for 8 years now , and I LOVE it . I bought it when I worked at a computer store . I am a photographer and I have used it ESPECIALLY for restoring OLD photographs . I would scan them into Photoshop ( 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and now 9 or aka CS2 ) using a Canon flatbed scanner ( see below ) , and then I would restore the photos . I NOW have a problem with my " PHOTOGRAPHERS PRINTER , the " Epson Stylus PHOTO PRINTER 1280 " - NO 64-BIT DRIVERS ! It is a $ 600.00 printer , with a WIDE 11 " carrier , great for printing photos , 11 " x 17 " brochures , or LARGE PHOTOS , etc . I used it A LOT but it still works GREAT but NOW they are FORCING us to upgrade upgrade , UPGRADE.I used a great little Canon flatbed scanner with it to scan the OLD PHOTOS into Photoshop , it had a software plugin that made it work right inside of Photoshop . It was pretty easy to install and easy to use . Over the years that I have had it I installed both the printer and the scanner on THREE different computer builds , over eight years .. FIVE STARS for SURE , for BOTH of them . ( DID a review on the Canon Flatbed Scanner 1220U USB , as well ) Since I only used this for special work I only used it 12-15 times a year but at 8 years that is 100-150 scans , it is still like new and STILL has the clear protector on it . The scanner is small and thin , easy to store anywhere . It is also high resolution , they still do not have many scanners , that are affordable , with this resolution . See also my reviews on the Canon Flatbed 1220U and on ' WINDOWS 7 ' titled " Leaves a LOT to BE DESIRED ! " However , now I have to sell them BOTH NOW ! I built a NEW computer , with Windows 7 64-bit and they BOTH quit supporting their products , with drivers a few years ago so they have NO 64-bit drivers . THIS new computer build is costing me A LOT MORE THAN I EXPECTED - besides these two items I have a few more items that WILL NOT WORK either ( 2 hardware and 3 software ) with a 64-bit operating system ! SO BEWARE IF YOU DECIDE TO GO TO 64-bit in the near future . Guess I will have to figure out HOW TO sell these things though Amazon 's Partner Program or whatever they call it ? airs ( dot ) us ( at ) frys ( dot ) com  
2	  I bought this camera for two purposes : 1 ) to replace an older VHS camera and 2 ) to use for converting my VHS tapes to DVD 's . I give it 4-1/2 stars for # 1 and 0 stars for # 2 . ( In my research before buying the camera , I managed to miss the fact that the GS320 does not have AV input , so can't be used to convert analog to digital . Rats ! ) However , for everything else I wanted , I was very satisfied . Other reviewers have pretty well expounded on the pros and cons . I 'll just say that the quality of pictures ( both video and still ) that we get with this camera is really great . When I first got the camera , I handed it our son who is studying Film Production and works with professional camcorders . After fiddling with the controls and looking over its features , he expressed great delight with my purchase . ( Yess ! ) It took me a while to figure out the menus and I haven't enough experience to handle the manual control options well , but overall , I would highly recommend this camera .  
1	  This mouse worked well for the first couple of weeks . Then , I unable to bring up Windows on my computer ( I have XP-Pro ) . Found out it was due to the mouse . IntelliPoint 4.1 software was uninstalled and reinstalled . Worked fine , for about 2 days . Now , everytime it locks me out of Windows , I have to shut down , unplug the mouse , start up , then plug mouse back in . Sometimes right button won't work . Not worth your money , trust me .  
1	  I was attracted by its slim design and the canon name . What I got was a very cheaply manufactured and highly defective product with massive software problems . The moving arm is noisy and constantly gets jammed making scanning photographs a nightmare . The software for the Mac is of the bundled nature and crashes constantly . There is a jumble of five different titles which look and operate poorly and cheaply . They are poorly integrated and guaranteed to crash even the best maintained system . They are not supported by the software companies who refuse to provide updates for " bundled " versions . None of these applications works well - if at all - in System X or in Classic and updates are not available , despite Canon 's assurances . The thing completely fell apart after 90 days , after which it was too late for me to return the product . It 's not even deep enough to make into a cat litter box , its only real suitable purpose . Avoid it and all other Canon scanners like the plague  
1	  After hooking the cord up to an additional monitor , the color on the monitor would change to a different shade , almost a pastel color . I tried it on other monitors just to make sure that the monitor wasn't faulty . The fortunate thing is , that it was cheap . Don't buy .  
1	  this case does not fit a hp ipacq 1935 .. its too big  
2	  I recently purchased the Microsoft wireless mouse and have been very pleased with its performance . It is an especially good value for the money .  
1	  This is a very nice camera in terms of the photos it takes , but I have had technical problems . The problem is that the camera displays a message " please remove lens cap " even though the lens cap has been removed . This is an intermittent problem which sometimes prevents me from taking pictures . Annoying . I have no idea how common this problem is and am prepared to give Nikon the benefit of the doubt that this is unusual and should not be taken as indicative of the quality of their digital cameras as a whole , however I do have a problem with the quality of service offered , which is certainly more broadly applicable . The product is under warranty so I sent this back to be repaired . Nikon would not cover the cost of shipping , although I asked them to do so . The camera was serviced and returned ( 2 weeks later ) , however the problem persisted . I requested that Nikon send me a new unit since they had failed to fix the problem and I did not have time to send it to them for another two weeks before I visited family for Christmas . Their service policy prevented them from doing this , but since it was a return service they would pay for shipping this time around . No good to me . The implication is that they take ownership of the problem if they fail to fix it with the first visit , however I would suggest that they ought to take full ownership of the faulty product from the start . They tell me that their policy is that they will consider replacing the product if I have to send it in for repair for the same problem a THIRD time . ( I think I will be shopping for Canon camera by that stage ) They are one step behind where a company of their standing should be . Sloppy .  
2	  I took my Canon sd800 in the waterproof case WP-DC9 thru the rapids in the Grand Canyon in May of last year . The camera worked flawlessly in spite of banging around in the rapids and camping 6 nights on sand bars . It is still working flawlessly ! Jo  
1	  I tested the Advent AW770 , Advent AW720 and the RCA WHP160 headphones . The audio quality was comparable on all 3 .. but the Advent phones each had drawbacks . The Advent phones had to be manually tuned to the right frequency . That was just too big a pain in the xx for me . These , the AW770 , had the tuning knob and the volume knob right next to each other ( and of course you can't see them unless you take off the phones ) , so you could accidentally detune when you meant to adjust the volume . I recommend the RCA WHP160 phones in this price range .  
2	  I 'm a hi-tech gadget guy who is hard to please , but this far exceeded my expectations ! I have it connected from a bedroom Directv Receiver ( 6 " from a 2.4GHZ wireless PC lan ) to a kitchen 15 " Magnanox LCD TV sitting 12 " below a micrwave oven without interference from microwave or lan ! I 'm even transmitting through 6 walls and a 5 gal . metal potato chip bucket and people walking in the kitchen without affecting the picture ! I was getting a super picture w / o even having 1 antenna directly facing the other antenna . I thought I was going to have to run between floors for hours until everything was aligned perfectly - it only took 15 seconds because alignment is very forgiving . Picture quality is 5 star crystal clear with no lines , static , etc . All TV channels are 5 star and the HDTV stations blew me away even though I know its not sending true HDTV though the avs-5811 . What surprised me most was that I could use my bedroom Directv remote ( down in the kitchen ) to change channels ( up in the bedroom ) by simply pointing at the ( kitchen ) avs-5811 receiver . It sends the remote control signal upstairs to a " mouse " that you place in front of your TV receiver , cable box , etc , IR sensor . I had a spare remote so I keep 1 in kitchen and 1 in bedroom for convenience . The owners manual iS POOR and doesn't tell you all this , but basically I can point the remote at the avs-5811 receiver in kitchen requesting a Directv channel change ( or any other remote control function ) in the upstairs bedroom . The avs-5811 transmitter in the bedroom receives the request and sends it through the " mouse " to the Directv Receiver which changes the channel as requested and the new channel video and sound is return to the kitchen ! Pure magic and ingenious ! It is a very cost effective way , without losing picture quality and convenience , to avoid running cables and drill holes through my tiled walls or granite counters .  
1	  My 550 lasted 12 weeks and then froze up completely . There was no trauma whatsoever . After 5 weeks I found out that it cannot be repaired . The red eye with indoor flash makes the photos useless unless you want to use software to correct each photo . I bought this camera because of the good reviews on Amazon but after researching online , I find that many have had similar problems . While it was working , the outdoor photos were very good .  
1	  I feel that this lens seems a lot slower then my others . Since this is not a lens that I must use since I have a better lens at the same focal length I rarely use it . I don't recommend it but others might like it .  
1	  1 . Setup was a pain . It 's connected to my router , but , got a wrong IP address which seemed to have been known for a while per the website of the manufacturer . ( why don't they do something about it ! ) . 2 . Technical support is useless . I talked to a couple of folks in Philipines ( nothing personal to the country ) , but , they 're just interested in log in collecting my personal information without providing any value-added technical solutions . Typical cheap call center . I felt like talking to a wall and listened to a recorded information . 3 . The range and the speed are not good at all ! 4 . I don't recommend at all .  
1	  I ordered this product to listen to my ipod in the car . I followed the instructions and tried it for a week , but was never able to listen to my music with out the static . I felt like I was listening to records . I wouldn't recomed this .  
1	  I called Go Video customer service to ask a question and could not get a person . I e-mailed and got a reply from Jorge Arroyo who told me to call the phone number . When I replied to his message saying that I could not get a person , the reply came back so I was left with no options at all . I am very disappointed in Go Video because my brother and I have sung their praises in the past to find out their customer service means nothing .  
2	  I had bought this camera as a replacement for my " old " 2MP Olympus , and I must say that Olympus have done a great job . The pre-set dial on the back makes selecting shooting modes much easier , with choices of Auto-shoot , programmed auto-shoot ( where you can create your settings ) Manual , movie mode ( Quick Time movies with sound ) self-portrait , landscape / portrait , sport , night scene , and landscape . The viewfinder ( an rarity with point and shoot digital cameras these days ) , is a little small , but does the job . The screen is incredibly sharp and gives you a real sense of how the shot will turn out . It is very nice in the hand , and very stable to use ( no more camera shake ! ) In short , a crisp , clean , sweet camera , and well-recommended .  
2	  Samsung HLT6187SAX 61 " Slim LED Engine 1080p DLP HDTVWe are very happy with the T.V. and the White Glove Service for setup . There are 4 reasons for buying this T.V. , 1st is the DLP picture which is very clean , crisp and just amazing ( that 's why Movie Theaters us them ) . 2ed is the LED Engine , I know that LED 's will last forever ( it was very important not to have to worry about bulb replacement ) . 3rd is the price I got from Amazon . com , I 've purchased several items from them and have always been completely satisfied ( I tell everyone who will listen to shop Amazon first and then look at the other guys price ) . 4th is the delivery and setup , it all went by the book , they set it up and even turned it on to make sure it worked . We couldn't be happier .  
1	  Price looked good , and the unit looks good to . However operation is a different story . I have had 3 other NAS devices . I needed another one , I placed it on the LAN and was able to find it with no problems . However , once I searched for it in network neighborhood and opened the public folder and threw some files at it then deleted the files it locked up . I reset it and again did the same thing , seems ever time I delete files it stops working . I then brought it home and tried it on my LAN , same problem . I went to the company site to get the latest firmware for it , which of course has a broken link for the download . save your money and buy something with a better name !  
1	  The prints I got with this from my Picturemate charm looked great , but the ink is a joke . It only lasted for about 60 of my 150 sheets of paper . I was printing sepia toned images , so I suspect that has something to do with it . Don't rely on the ink that comes with this product , always have at least two back up ink cartridges .  
2	  This item lasted me seven months before the wire for the microphone shorted out from positioning it up and down too many times . Although i did it 2-5 times a day to eat and game and not have to worry about getting food on the microphone . I 've also dropped the thing off of my mouse level desk MANY times . When i first got it looked kinda cheaply made but the thing is surprisingly durable . The specs for the mic arent as good as newer mics but it is EXCELLENT quality . Sound and bass have been superb . Ordering another after i write this . Just becareful how often you move the microphone glider up and down and how quickly you do it . Treat it carefuly and it will last a long time .  
2	  This product is definately worth the money . Cleaner power reduces visible noise in television screen images , as well as the hiss you hear coming from your speakers when you have them turned up . Also , every thing connected to this surge protector is insured to over $ 350,000 , an amount likely to cover almost any home entertainment system that any of us non-millionaires can afford . With that said I do have to criticisms : Firstly , although the bright blue power light is attractive and makes the HTS850 look expensive , it can be a tad on the bright side , lighting up the space behind your t . v . cabinet when you have the lights dimmed . Secondly , other than the plugs on the top and bottom , all of the plugs are located on the right side of the unit , making plugging in all of your devices a bit of a hassle , epsecially if they have large plugs . Over all it is an excellent product which I would recommend to anyone looking to protect the entertainment investment .  
1	  I bought the 50 pack definitely for the price and the specs seemed to be ok . I got them and had them on reserve for when my current supply of a different brand runs out . Finally I went to use a disk out of the 50 pack in this years model of the Panaonic Home DVD Recorder . Not one single disk out of the top five was detected by the recorder . Now I am stuck with useless disks since my return date is passed with Amazon and I can't get a refund . Now I am glad I paid so little for them .  
1	  This ink worked the first day and then it would not work anymore . Not the best way to spend $ 5.00 but I thought it would be worth a shot seeing if the cheaper product works . I guess sometimes it is better to spend more to get a product that works .  
2	  Excellent quality ; high grade construction ; unbeatable for the $ . I bought 3 and wished I bought 2 more . This is my best buy of the year so far and would recommend it to anyone needing HDMI cables .  
2	  This battery really extends the usability of my iPaq ( 5550 ) . The downside , for me , was I thought this battery was the exact dimensions of the original . It 's not . It 's about 6mm thinker . Meaning it sticks out the back . So if the unit is sitting flat on a bench and you press the power-on button the whole thing rocks backs , unless you hold the thing down . Also with this battery fitted you cannot slip on a compact flash sleeve or any other for that matter ( unless the sleeve you have accepts an additional battery on it 's back ) . So weigh up what you want to do - have long battery life or be able to slip on accessories . It 's one or the other . And remember when you change the battery you loose everything stored internally on the iPaq - a real pain .  
1	  This player is WAY too prone to static electricity . It crashed / rebooted EVERY TIME I touched it . I returned it for a refund .  
2	  Great product I would give it a 4.5 . The only problem is what every one has said about the bleeding other than that great for the price .  
1	  Am upset with this one because the suction cup does not grib on that vechile sucaion topll how is that am sold the wrong item and the mount wont lock inside the mount .  
1	  I bought this player about a year and a half ago . It worked great ( for about 3 months ) . It played all the DVDs and CDs . Unfortunately , it cannot read VCDs or CD-R / RWs . For most people that doesn't matter , I guess . However , only after about 3 months of light usage , the player started to act-up . Sometimes , it won't read the DVDs-the player indicated " no disc " in player . I unplugged it and it worked . Then , it doesn't work again , and I repeated the same procedure of unplugging . Finally , I sent the player back to RCA . Since it was still under warranty , all I had to do was pay for shipping . It came back after about a month . It worked , and then I started to see the problem again within a couple of days . I was confused . Why does it work sometimes but sometimes it fails to work ? So , I tested it out to see the prob . myself . It appeared that the disc tray motor sounded weak , and being unable to read the disc , I thought , could be due to the fact that RCA had provided a weak motor part . I was half right . I removed the plug from the UPS / power supply and plugged it directly into the wall . So far , I have no problem . I think I may have found a solution ( for now ) - the difficulty in reading the disc , I concluded , was due to lack of power [ believe it or not ] . Well , if you have the same problem , try unplugging it and have a dedicated power supply for this player . It might work . Beside this , the machine is good . It played every single DVDs I 've ever rented or bought . I have this hooked up to my reciever through TosLink ( optical cable ) . The sound is excellent-good proportion of sound from center , satellite , rear and subwoofer . It plays CD but it takes a second or 2 to skip to songs . Basically , don't expect it to play it like a real cd player . It sounded just as good though . I 'm getting rid of it now because I want a new and better player that also plays VCDs .  
2	  Very pleased with this Canon product . However I don't think I should have been charged sales tax seeing how this item came from New Jersey .  
2	  Let 's face it , all you 're going to do with an HDMI cable it plug it behind your TV and never see it again , right ? Well this is extremely affordable and gets the job done so I 'd say it 's a winner .  
1	  I have had this unit for 4 months and was a little bit worried about buying a ' TIVO ' brand unit rather than a name brand . The 90 day labor warranty should have been a tip off . Anyway , here I am , 4 months in , and anything recorded or passed through the recorder has an intense tinny overtone . I verified the problem was coming from the recorder by hooking my TV directly up to my cable box - the cable box sound is functioning just fine without the TIVO . Although news programs are comprehensible , movies and music are just plain painful to listen to . And now I face a mind boggling customer support experience from a startup company that is clearly not set up to support stereo components in the same way as a name brand . Next time I will buy a Sony ; my last Sony DVR is still going strong after 2 years .  
2	  I used to have Three Lacie drives as my backup ( two FW400 drives , one USB2 drive ) . After having the two FW400 drives die on me while they were still under warranty ( and the company would not repair or replace my failing drives ) , I knew I needed to try another brand . After hearing from a roommate that the external hard drive she 's carried around in her backpack was a G-Tech , I decided to give them a chance . 2 G-Tech drives later , I 'm a convert . I ended up getting this particular model as a gift last year . So far , I 've had no problems with it . They never overheat , are fast , super quiet , and easy to daisy chain ( even if it 's to a different model G-Tech ) . The best part about them is I never have to install software on my macs like I had to do with my Maxtor Drive ! They run just as well on my MacBook Pro as they do when hooked up to my iMac . The only con is all the cords .  
2	  I buyed the Reader because my Minolta Dimage S414 camera currently does not have Linux support . :-( I use the reader with Linux Fedora Core 1 and it is fast and very easy to connect . The USB cable included is good because allow to connect the reader in the vertical USB port of my notebook .  
1	  Despite the reviews I decided to try it ( my luck ) out . The one I got had orange sticker with null modem printed on top . Guess what , it is just a mislabeled gender changer . I even checked with a multimeter . Do not waste your time on this unless you want a gender changer .  
2	  I purchased my HL-1250 printer in the summer of 2001 , and it has been chugging along faithfully ever since . The only problem I have had was when some cat hair ( I had three long-haired cats at the time ) got wound around the roller of the toner cartridge . I bought a new drum at the time ( still have it stored in brand-new condition ) , thinking that might be the problem . As it turned out , a new toner cartridge made everything " right " once again . I believe I 've gone through four high-capacity ( TN460 ) toner cartridges , so that should be well over 30,000 copies , and it 's still functioning flawlessly . An occasional ( very rare ) cheap envelope may cause a minor printing glitch , but that is soon rectified . I realize this machine is almost ten years old and nothing lasts forever , so when the time comes to replace it I will definitely opt for another Brother .  
1	  I bought this camera . At 5 meters was full of water .. BE CAREFULL ! DO NOT BUY ! - message to amazon : you must have no star rating option -  
2	  I got the iPod about 3 months ago , and it has held up to the most important of my standards - it hasn't broken . I drop it on the sidewalk every few days , but it never even skips . I really appreciate the durability .  
2	  Works very nisely . I use it with a M3 DS Simply . I don't notice any speed slowdown playing my bought games with it .  
2	  I had 3 digital cameras , that was the first one . I had also casio z40 and kodak ls743 . I would never get rid of 4330 , but I could not stand battery life .. I had 4 2000mah and I had to charge them all the time .. the other thing was size of this camera , kinda big , and that cover / cap .. But the pictures was incerdibly good , colors were natural , super pix in low light .. I hope I find similar quality camera with diferent kind of battery .  
2	  I think these mail in rebates are the worst things in the world . Why would you buy from a manufacturer and then have to wait for a rebate . These rebates turn me off to the product .  
1	  Logitech really missed the mark here . What a bunch of knuckle draggers they must have had working on this . Just about anything that could be badly done when designing a remote was done here . The little screen uses fonts which are blurry at the resolution the screen displays . The icons on the screen interfere with readability of the text to make it almost illegible . The numeric buttons are too tightly packed to be able to effectively use them in the dark . The layout of the buttons requires that you shift your grip up and down the remote for related functions , such as displaying a channel guide , paging through it , viewing info on an item , and making a selection . The charging station requires that the remote sit so precisely in position that it seems just a gentle breeze could cause a shift and stop the charging . And the build quality-at least that of my remote-is very bad . The rocker button in the center of the remote requires much more force pushing on the right side of it than the left . The numeric keys down the left side of the remote take so much pressure to work them that it is difficult to not press more than one at a time . Finally , although the software is very intelligent about a great many devices and their interactions in a systematic way , it requires that you create a user account on Logitech 's web site to program the remote . It was no trouble to enter fake credentials and a junk email address but still , come on , a user account ? All in all , Logitech did a horrible job with this remote . There 's not much else about it that could have been poorer .  
2	  I 'm able to level the camera both vertical and horizontally . I 'm able to lock it in place . I have no concerns with this head .  
1	  I ordered this radio and was very disappointed . The outlet store that shipped it , did not send it well . The box was torn , some parts were in a ziploc bag . The cover of the cassette player was not attached , and I could not get it on . The CD player did not work . I returned the item and still have not seen a credit to my account . If you can help , please let me know . Again , I was not satisfied .  
2	  I got this to put on my motorcycle , I have talked over 8 miles with it so I think it is doing good  
1	  The trackpad seems to work fine , a little bit of lag here and there . The keyboard was absolutely UNUSABLE . Key entries would take 3-10 seconds to appear on the screen and would often repeat 10 + times with one key-punch input . Initially thought it was interference with WIFI as bluetooth and WIFI both use the 2.4ghz band , but after shutting down the router , the problem persisted . This review pertains to : Apple Bluetooth Wireless Keyboard ( purchased on amazon ) Apple Bluetooth Magic Trackpad ( purchased on amazon ) Update ( 5/17/12 ) : Bought a Rocketfish MRBTAD usb bluetooth adaptor . Works out of the box with both the keyboard and the trackpad . No software install necessary .  
2	  The assembly instructions for my recently purchased DB8 Multi-directional HDTV antenna was lacking in clarity . Pictures were inadequate , needed line drawings showing parts and alignment more clearly . Joe S  
2	  These headphones cover the ears wonderfully . You can still hear other noises around you , but maybe that 's because I don't blast sounds in my ears . In my opinion these were a great price point pair of headphones .  
2	  For $ 100 list price , this camera just performed phenomenally . The image quality was quite passable , better than expected , amazing for such an inexpensive camera . It is VERY user-friendly : in fact , I didn't even need the instructions at all for most applications , was able to figure it out . Uses a standard SD memory card and gets surprisingly good battery life out of 2 batteries : as long as another camera I had that used 4 batteries . But I strongly recommend using rechargeable batteries , nonetheless , as with any reasonably powerful camera . A camera at this price range would be expected to have some shortcomings . Here are what I liked least : 1 ) Flash a bit strong in macro mode . This is undoubtedly why the camera defaults to suppressed flash in macro mode . The macro range is not bad for its price , but you have to be careful with the shooting angle if a close-up flash is needed so the pic doesn't come out as just a big bright blur . 2 ) Pics tend to be a bit high in contrast . Some may like this vivid enhancement , but the detail " in the shadows " suffers . Colors appear somewhat unnaturally bright . This is easy to balance out when editing . 3 ) Need a card reader . No big deal . SD card readers that connect to a USB port run about $ 10-15 . I never really used the movie mode , so can't very well comment on that . It 's also quite rugged . I 've been less careful in handling it than with more expensive cameras , and it survived being dropped on hard surfaces several times . All in all , a superb camera for the price . Digital cameras have come a long way !  
1	  This product is terrible . I cannot get the thing to stay on a station , it jumps all over the place . For some reason the FM doesn't work at all and it is built really cheap . I expected alot more for my Thirty bucks .  
1	  I bought this ink at a good price , too good as it turns out . When I received the printer ink , it was not in the original box . It was still sealed in the plastic , just not in the original box . The packing slip stated that " This ink is expired but should still work in your device . " Well , it didn't work . The expiration date on the ink is from 2004 and the printer recognizes that and won't use it . If I had known that this is what they were going to send , I would have bought more expensive ink that actually works .  
1	  I bought one and have regretted that purchase over and over . IMHO the Pentax Optio W30 sucks big time . I sent the first camera back for repair because of the loud clicking sound the camera made while trying to focus in movie mode . It made so much noise that it would drown out any audio you were recording at the time . I asked if this was a problem they had heard of before and the tech on the phone said " No , you will have to send the camera back so we can check it out " . Spent $ 34.17 sending the camera back overnight shipping because I was heading for the Grand Canyon in about 2 weeks and I bought this camera specifically for the trip . I found out later that this is a problem that goes back to the W10 , continued through the W20 and is still a problem with the W30 . A different tech I talked to later said " That was supposed to be fixed with the W30 " . They WILL lie to you . They will not reimburse you for shipping even though the problem is with their camera design . None of the techs would let me talk to a supervisor or anybody else in their food chain . There were many other issues I had trying to get the camera shipped back before I left on vacation . Made a bunch of phone calls and sent a bunch of emails trying to get my questions answered . Pentax has the worst customer service I have ever encountered in my life - period . The camera ingested a large amount of water about halfway down the Grand Canyon run and quit working altogether thereby depriving me of the pictures I would have taken had I bought another camera . After leaving the Grand Canyon , I was heading to northern Colorado to do some paddling so I called Pentax and told them that I was on the way to their headquarters in Golden and I wanted my money back . They could keep this water filled hunk of junk and use it for a fish sinker . I called them again while I was in their parking lot to let them know that I was there . I sat in their reception area for nearly an hour before anybody , besides the receptionist , would talk to me . I thought about getting arrested while I was there , then decided against it . Finally , two guys came out with a new W30 and after a half hour of talking I finally figured out that there was no way I was ever going to get my money out of these jerks - so - like a moron I took the new camera . It has the same problem as the first camera with the video . As to the ability to see the screen , nothing you can do will make it were you can see the screen in bright sunlight . You will be reduced to pointing the camera in the general direction of what you want to photograph and pushing the shutter button . If you own a Pentax , I wish you the best of luck . If you don't , I would recommend that you keep it that way . I don't like the camera and I really don't like the people that work for Pentax . There is a lot more to the story but I don't need to sit here and type up another couple of pages , just let me reemphasize - the worst customer service I have ever encountered . As a matter of fact - I think I 'll take another stab at getting my money back today . I 'll let you know how it works out . As it turns out - the second W30 was as big a hunk-O-junk as the first one . After three months of trying I finally got my money back from Pentax . Lousy camera and a lousy company to do business with . One more time ; The worst customer service I have ever encountered in my life and that 's saying something .  
1	  This set is garbage . One of the speakers died on me within a week , and the ' sub ' seemed to be nothing more than a hollow tube . Bass ? I think they meant bass like the fish , because the sounds coming out of this thing were similiar to the sounds a gutted fish makes . I thought it would be a nice addition to my ipod , but it was nothing more than a paper weight .  
2	  I choose this player because of the CNET review and other sources . They were spot-on . Amazing sound quality , easy to use controls , good battery life . If you don't need huge amounts of storage , I highly recommend this player .  
1	  don't waste ur money get a technic 1200 or a numark ttx or the stanton 150 .  
1	  .. because the lifespan of this unit is amazingly short . Plays DVDs and VHS tapes fine and recording ( and copying ) is fairly easy . Still , it was less than a year before I got an error code on the front panel . I had to send the unit to Panasonic for a $ 130 flat-rate repair ( they replaced the DVD drive , which I found was a pretty common issue with this model ) . It worked fine for another few months , and now I have an F03 code . Don't know what it is * and don't care ; I 've had it with this thing . I really need to get my VHS tapes converted over and then I can be finished with this whole fiasco . Until , that is , I have to convert my DVDs to Blu-ray , and then Blu-ray to holocube , and then holocube to brain chip .. * Evidently F03 is the code for " Imperial Stormtroopers in the VHS slot . " Easy fix , but still .  
1	  Despite the other reviews , I decided to give this a try but I wish I 'd gone with the casette adapter instead ( those are getting better reveiws , especially the Coby ) . The static gets pretty bad , both in my hometown and on road trips . Its hard to find a consistent station ( even at home where I can use the same one regularly ) that doesn't pick up alot of static at some point . Like another reviewer mentioned , it works best when you can HOLD the transmitter in a certain position in relation to your radio or antenna .. but its not exactly convenient ! The product also seems to be cheaply made , the cord has pulled apart from the piece that plugs into the MP3 , exposing the internal wires . I think its too late to return it or I certainly would ! I also thought I had seen that this unit came with a charger that plugs into your cigarette lighter , but it does not ; it is a DC adapter .  
2	  If your sub has a LFE terminal then this is the cable to go with it . It has tamed my aggressive Mirage Omni S8 subwoofer making it perform to it 's true potenial and bringing out the subtlties of the sub . Mind you it needs some breack in time of about 50 hours or so as did my sub . Don't be too concerned about the grouding wires on the cable as I had no need to connect them but if there is a slight hum comming from the sub than connect the wires to your sub and unit so there grounded . Really not a big deal .  
1	  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER , I have had a Hp 1100 and had moderate success with it , after a few months the multiple paper pickup and jam problem kept occuring with no satisfactory fix , I just got this printer and it is even worse , it does not print correctly and multiple jams even after two hours out of the box , the copy was consistantly misaligned . I am sending it back .  
2	  this cooler is very quiet , and cools my older laptop which builds up even more heat that the newer ones I have . It 's a really good product .  
1	  first of all i am not happy with the purchace of this product yeah it was a reasonable price but you get what you pay for this battery charged once and now my dell wont even turn on .  
2	  I got two of these rolls and the cable is pretty thin , but perfectly good . Unfortunately , I ran these cables within new construction and then my electrical inspector explained that they cannot be used within walls . So I had to remove this cable and use certified cables for in-wall applications . I wrote to RCA on their website and never heard back from them if this cable meets any standards or has any ratings / certification . FYI .. CL2 / CL3 rating is a rating given to speaker wire by the Underwriters Laboratories , it means that the wire has been thoroughly tested for safety in case of fire or electric shock and approved for in-wall use . The CL2 ( Class 2 ) rating means the cable is certified for use in homes . A CL3 ( Class 3 ) rated cable has a higher threshold for heat , so it 's certified for commercial or industrial buildings . Some CL3 cables are also separately rated for direct burial , making them useful for outdoor installations . If you are going to install in-wall , in-ceiling , or outdoor speakers in your home , then you 're going to need to check which rating your local code requires . Again , I do not believe this cable has CL2 or CL3 ratings .. so for the same price , or a bit more , you can buy other cables that have this rating . It should also better shield the cable from nearby electric .  
2	  Not sure what some of the problems were with the negative reviews but I highly suspect they did not know what they were doing . I 've burned over a twety DVDs with this brand , everything from backups , picture storage to my daughters home videos . Never had a problem with a single one of them . Only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I found a cheaper brand that also hasn't given me problems .  
1	  .. a DOA brown Zune . I was given a Zune as a gift and was excited to own my first MP3 player . Unfortunately it was the brown one but oh well , it was free . It took awhile to figure out the software as it was confusing . I have Windows XP Pro and am no slouch with the computer but it was still confusing . They really need to make everything a bit easier to get up and running . Finally I loaded some songs onto it . Decent sound . Ok , maybe this is gonna work out . Then I turned it off . 30 minutes later I went to turn it back on and NOTHING . It would not turn on . Where is the QC from MS ? I called a friend of mine who is a bit of a MacDroid . One of the reasons I never considered the iPod is because he constantly raves about it and sometimes he drives me nuts . He always says he likes to reward innovation , not imitation . I was hoping I could " one up him " with something new . So I called him and he brought his iPod over and we put the players side by side . Then he showed me iTunes . The Zune did seem clunky and awkward after sitting next to the iPod . And that software , MS has a long way to go to catch up with iTunes . Yea , it was impressive and looked easy to use . At this point I am done with the Zune . I gave it a shot and it died out of the gate . I am taking it back ( hope there is a warranty ) and buying an iPod . I have no choice but to give anything DOA one star . Without the backing of the corporate world it will be interesting to see if the Zune sinks or swims .

1	  So i got the adapter today and i put it into my car trying to see if it worked well . I was disappointed then nothing i did would make it work . My cassette player spat out the adapter every time no matter which way i put it in . Good thing it i only paid 3 bucks or i would have been alot more mad .  
2	  The Bose Around-Ear Headphones have been out for a while , now . They are of the same high quality you can expect out of any Bose product . The consumer must remember that these are NOT noise-canceling headphones . They have no active noise-reducing technology built in . They do , however , provide a good seal around the ears . Turning up the volume of the sound source overrides most external noises . As long as you keep the small port in each can unblocked , the overall frequency response of these headphones is great . They maintain warm bass tones nicely balanced with crystal clear upper frequencies . They are packaged with a Nylon draw-string pouch and extra 5 ' of cable plus 1/4 " to 1/8 " jack adapter , both necessities if you will be doing any listening at your office or home entertainment system .  
1	  Try calling amazon for service on something you bought .. good luck .. this item doesn't come with a cord to connect to your computer , and it needs a special one that amazon doesn't offer . I 'm rating amazon more than the product , since I can't even get the product to work .. poor customer service and product control .. I 'd advise to buy this product somewhere else that at least supplies you with a cord to get started .. or at least offers one !  
1	  This drive didn't work on my PowerBook G4 ( aluminum case ) . I borrowed a separate power cable from a co-worker and plugged the second usb-power cable into the USB slot I normally use for my mouse . Even with two USB cables connecting the PowerBook to this drive , it still just illuminated the blue light and had a tick tick ticking sound . If you have a PowerBook laptop , save yourself some time and buy a Mercury On-The-Go FireWire 800/400 portable drive .  
2	  The headphones are quite nice .. excellent quality . Easy to wear and the adjustable cross piece is very comfortable .. sound is VERY good for the pice .  
1	  I bought the canon S80 a year back . During the new years party yesterday i got the E18 error . The lens won't retract or extend after this . After researching this error , i am pretty annoyed about it . In nutshell , the camera is as good as trash now . Listen to the other reviewers and at least search for " canon E18 error " before you buy any canon camera . On the positive side , this camera took good pictures till it worked .  
2	  I just love this lens ! Great focus and cuts down the noise . LOVE it !  
2	  There are lots of helpful remarks in the previous reviews . I 'll just add that the " 3-d " view provided by this and other Garmin units seems much easier to use with a quick glance than the top-down views on other units . Other than the size of the screen , this unit is superior to the nav system that came in my ' 03 Toyota Prius in every regard . It 's very easy to use . I should mention that my unit arrived about two weeks ago with system 2.1 on it . During our first trip using it , the unit froze while we were heading down Route 1 in central NJ . Power cycling it got us back on track , and we 've no other problems since . However , I just looked on the Garmin website and found that the current system for this unit is 3.2 , as of December 6 . Updating the system software on my PC in the office was quite simple , and I 'm glad that the unit will be ( presumably ) more stable than ever .  
2	  I am successfully using this cable to connect my airport expressto my onkyo receiver . I am now streaming music from my mac , over a wireless ( linksys ) to the airport express , through thiscable , and to the receiver . It works great .  
1	  Had this unit and I cannot say if it was reacting to a surge or not , but it blew the breaker on the ciruit and the rear of the unit is burnt . None of the other surge protectors or breakers went off in the house . No damage to the wall or any equipment , but this surge protector was in an outlet with a metal cover plate - which is what I think saved the house from a fire . There were a few things plugged into it , but none of them were on besides two alarm clocks as we were out of the house . I do not recommend this item .  
2	  I have only been using this battery for a couple of weeks now but so far it appears to be working very well for me . It is holding it 's charge for good time length so now I am hoping to see the battery last a long time . Time will tell .  
2	  This item is just as advertised . I have had the Kensington air / auto / ac charger for a little over a year and have used it extensivly . Recently the cord that plugeed into my laptop developed a short from rolling it up for travel . I was really glad to see this winder with the replacement cord . It works perfectly . The flat cord and wind up design eliminates the problem of winding the cord for packing . It also takes up less space as it winds up tighter than you woulld dare roll the standard cord . I highly recommend it . Kensington 33347 Travel Cable Winder for Kensington Power Adapters  
2	  So far this machine is all I hoped it would be . It set up very easily with no problems and delivers quality photos and great text pages .  
1	  The quality of the copies that are produced is acceptable but not outstanding . My older Canon dedicated copier made better quality copies , and was faster . This may be the result of the compromise inherent in a multifunction machine compared to a machine that is dedicated to do one task . What is of concern is that this Brother began to make mechanical noises from its paper path when copying when it was less than 90 days old . On-site service is not covered under warranty . The local authorized service centers want $ 80 to $ 90 for on-site service , so the I had the machine taken to an authorized service center , where it is now waiting for parts . The machine will be out of service for at least one week . I am using a flat-bed scanner to do copying in the interim . I have a Brother fax machine which has been reliable , so the break-down of this machine is disappointing . I wonder if this machine will continue to be unreliable in the future . If I had to do it again , I would choose a Canon or HP .  
1	  its alot cheapter at Best Buy and you do not have to pay shipping , nor do you have to wait months .  
1	  I HAVE OWNED THIS CAMERA FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW I BOUGHT IT WHEN DIGITAL CAMERAS WERE STILL PRICEY PAID ABOUT $ 225.00 I HAVE BEEN SHOPPING FOR A NEW CAMERA AND HAVE DECIDED TO BUY THE KODAK Z740THIS WAS MY FIRST DIGITAL CAMERA THE REVIEWS AT THE TIME I BOUGHT IT WERE VERY GOOD FOR THE MONEY BUT THAT WAS THEN AND THIS IS NOW AND NOW YOU CAN GET MORE CAMERA FOR YOUR MONEY !

1	  Well , I ve had this player for a while now , about 8 months I 'd say . Out of all that time it 's been in the working condition for about 3 months only , and that is including the 2 replacements iOmega sent me after the previous player broke down . As a player , it 's a pretty great thing , with tremble / bass adjustments and all that a player should have , BUT since it 's zip disk input keeps breaking down , I would not recommend it to anyone , unless they plan on using just one zip disk and never take it out ( if you do take disks out and put them back in , chances are that they will get stuck on the 50th time , and have fun ordering the replacement ) . The only thing saving it from a " 1 " is that I really liked it ' till it broke down .  
1	  I suppose if you don't live in a metropolitan area with stations around the frequencies the iRock has presets for , you might get better performance out of it than I have . I have had my unit about one week , and I must say I am disappointed . The idea is great , but the functionality at the power it puts out stinks . I have tried all kinds of positioning , even placing the unit in my ashtray which is directly below my radio . I tried aligning the unit 's cord so it is oriented correctly with the car antenna . On top of mediocre performance , it has gobbled through batteries , and despite a lot of empty space inside the unit , there isn't an option for a DC power adapter . Hey iRock , if you are reading this , don't take it personally , but you should have done more field testing before releasing this product .  
2	  Good mouse to use . I travel a lot for work and use this everyday . I tend to be a bit clumsy , so I have dropped it quite a bit , but it kept working and working . After 2 years and 8 months of this , it was time to get a new one though . But it is a great mouse to use . Heck , it was the mouse that I bought to replace my old one .  
2	  I replaced a Samsung Home Theater System with this Sony .. better sound , better DVD system . Fair price for quality system .  
2	  It suited the purpose that I needed it for at a very nice price . My real complaint the cable could have been a couple of feet longer .  
2	  I have tried many , many different types of headphones and earphones and these are definitely one of the best I have come across . There are a couple of things I don't like about them though . First is the rubber padding around the buds , it makes it very difficult to fit into your ear . Using the earphones without the padding ( easy to slip off and back on ) seems more comfortable and the sound improves greatly when they are removed except that the bass is less prominent . Another thing I dislike is the durability . I have to replace them every few months . I usually have a problem with the cord wearing thin and eventually splitting and / or ripping . One of the main things I like about the earphones is the volume : it 's excellent , definitely the loudest I have used . Other things I like include the appearance and the length of the cord . Overall , excellent deal . About $ 5 for a good 3 or 4 months of great sound quality .  
1	  Theoretically this is a great product . All the good stuff that has been said is pretty much true . However .. The first one I bought lasted about 6 months . Then , it just quit playing dvd 's , cd 's . So I bought another one . August 30,2008 . November 1 , 2008 it simply doesn't even play any kind of disk . Bought it brand new . 2 in a row ? Maybe I should change the title to Reliable - you may rely on it to crash . Fortunately , I bought a 2-year replacement plan ( after the product 's 1-year warranty ) . Wish me luck . Amazon 's customer service , by the way , has always been top-notch .  
1	  No matter the adjustments I made , it would turn on and off over and over when iMac went to ' sleep ' . I gave it two weeks and constant fiddling , but I have given up . Two stars for layout and the unit has a good heft to it . Unit feels substantial and has a nice long cord with a flat to the wall plug . It just wouldn't work with my already power-conscientious iMac .  
2	  same product at park ave . electronics which is brand new costs $ 675.78  
1	  I bought these because I was in need of a pair of good quality headphones , with good longevity , to wear while I study for finals . I paid 93.08 cents after taxes for these . The sound quality is what i expected , but the construction of these feel incredibly cheap . I will be returning them in a few days , and ordering a pair of krk kns-6400 or 8400 .  
1	  I loved it when it worked : great features , no problems with WMA , good battery life ( though not as good as advertised ) . But after a couple of months it became prone to freezing when reading MP3 and WMA files , which became increasingly worse over time , and now it won't even read factory-pressed CDs . The disc just spins and spins , trying to boot up but failing . I didn't drop it or abuse it in any way . This is a huge disappointment .  
1	  My friends commented how blurry my screen was . I never noticed it probably because he came about slowly . But after connecting my old SONY Trinitron Multiscan G400 it was a night and day difference . It could be because I had this monitor sitting between two Event 20/20 BAS studio monitor speakers , but my SONY Trinitron G400 doesn't have any problems with clarity being between those two speakers . This Viewsonic monitor has a low quality , blurry image , and is now sitting in it 's box out in my garage ready for the trash .  
1	  I purchased this product , but after 3 months of frustrating use wound up throwing it away . The first problem is that the structural support of the power tips between the laptop plug and the cord plug is the electrical solder ! The effect of this is that if you use the adapter on the road where it 's subject to a lot of plug and unplug and varying mechanical stress , the solder breaks . You then at best have a tip with an intermittent connection . I replaced the tip twice before giving up and getting another better designed adapter . The second problem is that when I unplugged the power adapter from the wall , it would cause my laptop ( IBM T20 ) to emergency power off . Unplugged at the laptop plug was fine . I understand this to be an issue between the T20 power system and a surge issue in the adapter . I replaced this with a Kensington 33197 120W adapter . It looks almost like the same product ( same OEM ? ) except they have stronger power tips . It also didn't have the power-off issue . I loved the form factor , but the product just didn't work .  
1	  I 've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row . I 've spent hours with this product on several machines and I can now say the hardware sucks .  
1	  Performance is inconsistent . Pictures taken several seconds ( shutter lag is also an issue ) apart look drastically different . Auto-focus is hit and miss and sometimes won't lock when zoom is fully extended . After 6 months of use , I would give this camera a C- rating .  
2	  We purchased this for our 2 y . o . daughter 's playroom . It 's perfect for storing DVDs , books , etc . It was a pain to put together ( directions were a little difficult to follow ) , but it was worth it in the end . It 's the perfect size for a child to use .  
2	  I purchased the Sandisk Sansa m240 for my son for Christmas . Well , it only lasted a couple of days and then it locked up . After reading more reviews about it I found that almost everyone was having the same problem . So when I returned it I purchased this one instead of getting another Sansa . This one is so much better . My son loves it much more than the Sansa . During the short time that the Sansa worked he thought it was ok but when he got this one he said it is a lot better . The earphones seem to be better quality and it just seems like a much better quality player all around . It 's very small but packs a big punch soundwise . Very crisp and clear . It has all the features we were looking for . A good price for everything that you get in this little player . My husband likes it so much he wants one of his own to take to work .  
1	  Two wires lead to the headset , one of which transmits sound from the microphone to the computer , the other transmits sound from the computer to your earphones . Unfortunately , these are stuck together and are only allowed to travel separately for the last three inches or so . This means that your ' mic in ' jack and your ' headphone out ' jack must be adjacent or these won't work for you . If , like many people , your computer ( and the microphone in ) is under the desk and your speakers ( with the headphone outs ) are on top of the desk , then you will have to return this item .  
2	  This device does exactly what I wanted it to do , which is record interviews and make them easy to transcribe . I 'm a financial reporter in New York , and really noticed the DM-10 when I went to a press conference and four out of five reporters whipped them out . Now I know why : Back at the office , I can download a 45-minute recording to the computer in a minute , and review it at digital high speed or digital low speed as I choose . Indexing is easy . I can also convert to a . wav file so colleagues can review it . The software is the charm . Hardware 's not bad either : it slips easily in the pocket . Anyone who 's used an iPod will grok the " hold " switch , which is the " off " button if you 're not recording or playing . This would not be a very useful device for my purposes if absent a computer . I 've not tried to use it as an mp3 player . It uses regular AA batteries , a more robust power solution than rechargables . Power consumption seems low .  
1	  Granted , I ordered this cartridge over a year ago ( May 2011 from the vendor JAMinnovations ) for my HP Deskjet 845C and just now needed to install it . The cartridge that was in my deskjet ( purchased by the way from inkjetcartridges dot com ) lasted over a year - printing about 12-20 pages per week . It finally went dry , so I installed this one - figuring since it was a genuine HP cartridge in retail packaging ( which it wasn't - it was a white box , busted open , with instructions stuck on the outside ) that it would work great . But maybe if it really was an original HP product , since they probably don't make these for this older printer , it was dried up long ago . Anyway , I immediately ordered another cartridge from Amazon ( OfficeMax Black Ink Cartridge Compatible with HP 15 ( C6615DN ) OM98673 Sold by Speedy Inks , $ 8.99 ) . It arrived today , I installed it & it works great ! It was packaged very well , is fresh , isn't an " original " HP cartridge , but I don't think that matters for these older printers . It also has a " use by " date on it of 2014 . I 'll review that cartridge also .  
1	  So , I will keep it really simple . It took a long time to reach me ( probably from because it is just not " Made in China " its also " Shipped from China " ) .. then when I plugged I can only hear one side of my headphone speaker . I would suggest you not to waste your time and even a penny on this POS . As per the positive reviews I think either they are fake or those customers are lucky to have received a good working piece .  
1	  This product failed to work from the moment I connected it . I have 2 computers , but only use one at a time . When I plugged the splitter in I was hoping to be able to use one computer then shut it down and go to the other computer boot it up and use it . Unfortunately I couldn't get the first computer to connect to the web so I went back to plugging in one computer then unplugging it and plugging the other computer as needed .  
1	  I bought this cable to use the new transfer software in Windows vista . It does not work so I ended up trannsfering all my files by DVD this works much faster and easier and I would not of had to spend all the money to by the cable .  
2	  I am very please with the Coby DP102 . This product has many options to display your photos , videos and play your songs . Easy set up . It allows you to take the memory card right from your camera and transfer the images to another type of mediain the frame , love that option . You don't need the pc ( you still have that option of course ) . It has great graphic display of images . Even improves some of my bad photos . Sound quality is nice . Good volume , clear , not tinnie . Only problems I have had are the remote is slow to communicate with the frame and difficulty changing the frame ring ( color-black or white ) . Easy to clean . Very please with the pricing and quality . Would recommend and / or re-purchase .  
1	  this splitter is terrible . my roommate and i both run vga cables from our laptops to the tv and thought a splitter would make it so much easier than having to switch the cables back and forth , WRONG . the splitter dumbed down the resolution of the image going through to the screen and gave one of the worst images ive ever seen . just dont even bother with this piece of junk .  
1	  After about 1 year my mouse stopped working . It developed the most annoying habit of double clicking when I single clicked . I tweaked my mouse settings and there was nothing I could do to get my mouse to stop double clicking . Of course it only did it 25 % of the time so I kept using it for a few weeks but eventually I started to lose my mind and threw it away . Since most mice would work with my Mac I grabbed an old PC mouse I had and presto I was back in action and that trip to the psycho ward was avoided .  
1	  I 've owned and used this camera for almost 8 months , since Christmas 2003 . I liked it at first , as it was easy to use and operate . It became quickly apparent , though , that it sucks batteries dry at the speed of light . Whenever I changed the batteries-which was often , 99 % of the time I also had to reprogram the camera-a huge pain if you want to catch a particular moment . The 3x digital zoom zooms to 3x , there is no in-between , no control at all over the zoom . Over the last month , the zoom has worked sporadically-not working when I wanted and needed it the most . The picture quality is good , what you would expect , I think , from a 3.3 MP camera . But , overall , I wish I could get my money back .  
2	  The major strengths are the performance of the image sensor at 1600 ISO . It produces very good quality images here , and is a great way to break into the DSLR arena . Another great strength is the battery life . It can take almost two days ' worth of heavy vacation photos ( approx 6-700 exposures - 1/3 to 1/4 flash ) , before showing the need for a charge . It has a built-in editor that does red-eye repairs better than anything else I 've seen . The only weakness I can think of is the lack of an internal focusing motor , so that you couldn't have AF when using a Nikon film camera 's AF lenses on this body . It still works , just won't focus automatically . I you buy one of these , and wish to supplement the knowledge available from the owner 's manual , go here : $U$ Ken has done a great job of showing you how to get more out of this camera , or how to enjoy it more .  
2	  Good cheep audio cable . No static or distortion in the sound . Connected it to my sound bar and my laptop . Sounds great .  
1	  Wasted my time . The booster only works with version 2 of the BEFW11S4 , not the v 3.2 that is out now . It doesn't say this anywhere . I had to call their tech support to find this out . So if you go down to the store and buy both , they will not work together . You have to have an old model .  
2	  This is the lightest most appropriate USB mouse for a laptop . Therefore , when the first one developed a crack in the cable , I immediately replaced it with a new one . I have wound the part of the cable near the mouse with electrical tape in hopes that this will prevent the kind of breaking which my first one suffered . Unfortunately , those selling this product have by now figured out that there is nothing else on the market which is just like this one . Therefore , the price has gone up from $ 11 . to almost $ 30 . I therefore recommend winding electrical tape around the first inch of the cable from the get-go so you won't have to buy this product twice .  
2	  I use Team Speak and this set works GREAT ! mic is in a good place , team mates tell me i they can hear me much better now ( is that a good thing ? ) , head phones sound great ! i would recomend these to ANYONE doing any kind of online gaming in use with any team chat software . GREAT PURCHASE for under $ 20 .. retail website has these for $ 40  
1	  Colors were not crisp , but my main complaint would be the noise that it makes , this is my first HP product and i dont think i would buy another one .  
2	  I am very pleased with the service I have recently recieved from Amazon . I didn't recieve my Zen player and Amazon sent out another one . Thank you so much . I am going to give it to a my daughter for Christmas so after Christmas I will let you know how good the zen player is . Again thank you so much for your assistance .  
1	  Update : After writing an email to the President of Samsung USA , 2 PR people that work at the firm responsible for Samsung 's account I finally got a response from Samsung other then telling me to wait and they would get to it whenever . All in all it took me four + months and several hours on the phone to get a refund . I have to give them credit , once I wrote the people mentioned above someone called me the next day and shortly after my conversation with her I finally received a shipping label in my email to send the monitor back . I received the refund 3-4 weeks later . Last time I ever buy Samsung . - Poor product with no customer service . First as promised to Jennifer ( Executive Customer Service Supervisor ) : the phone number for Exec Service # 800-522-7341 & fax # 973-529-0293My first three ( 3 ) 305T monitors had problems right out of the box and my fourth ( 4th ) worked for 8 months and then died . ( Please note that all of these monitors were purchased brand new from three different retailers : Amazon , Newegg , B & H ; Photo ) . Monitor # 1 didn't work at all . Monitor # 2 : had a row of dead pixels that went from side to side of the monitor horizontally ( my screen looked like it had a divider between the top and the bottom ) . Monitor # 3 made bubbling noises whenever it was turned on . Monitor 4 worked great for about 8 months and then one day started rapidly flashing ( not a typical flicker , but more like the monitor was going on and off ) so bad that I had a terrible migraine after about 15 seconds . Now I 've had the joy ( sarcasm ) of contacting Samsung 's Executive Service ( ECS ) . I first contacted Samsung executive customer service ( ECS ) September 12th and informed them that ideally they would like my money refunded . A few weeks after I had performed the steps requested by ECS ( faxing my receipts in , etc ) I called to check the status , and apparently my claim has been closed ; no explanation could be given as to why . As a result I was forced to start over ( this is early October ) . Skip ahead ( past several phone calls and once of Samsung " not being able to find the receipts I submitted to them " ) to November 12th , I am approved for a refund since Samsung has no 305T monitors in stock to replace mine with ( never mind that fact that this was my 4th one and I have provided Samsung with all of my receipts ) . I 'm told that I should receive a shipping label to send my monitor back and should have a refund within 14-21 days from the Nov . 12th . As of this morning ( December 8th ) I have yet to receive a return shipping label and have heard the same pitch from ECS reps over and over again ( " I am not sure what the delay is , but I will contact the refund department and CC their and my supervisor on the message . " ) . So today I try a new tactic : I ask to speak to an ECR supervisor . Jennifer comes on the phone and tells me quite rudely that I " need to be patient " and that I " have only been waiting since October 12th " . I inform Jennifer that I actually called in September 12th to which she interrupts me and informs me that date is irrelevant and that the delay is caused do to the ( untrue ) fact that I exchanged the monitor with a retailer originally ( and I need to be more patient ) . Next , I tell Jennifer to look at all four receipts I submitted , as she will notice that none of the monitors were exchanged and each was made in separate purchases . Jennifer pauses for a minute and then tells me that the refund department does not typically issue refunds , they typically issue exchanges , so that is the reason for the delay and that I need to be more patient . ( If you do a little research you will find out that others have been told they will receive refunds , so that process doesn't seem to uncommon . ) We speak a little bit more with the end result being : I still don't know when I will receive a refund , but apparently I need to learn to be more patient and how much time it takes is irrelevant ( at least to Samsung and their Executive Customer Service rep supervisors , such as Jennifer ) . Also , as I promised Jennifer I am posting the direct line to ECR : 800.522.7341 & ECR 's fax 973.529.0293 in case anyone wants it . My next step : I guess will most likely filing a small claims suit against Samsung if I don't receive anything by the end of December . I hope this information helps . If anyone has any advice / tips it would be greatly appreciated  
1	  i saw these back when they were more expensive , i thought spending a bit more than those 9.99 ear phones will be worth it in the long run .. but they didnt last not even a month ! .. they worked fine for about three weeks , then i tried to sleep with them , and they kept falling out .. the sound is ok , it brags about bass , but you cant seriously hear any bass , i listen to dub , reggae and rap , in order to hear the bass , you literally have to shove the ear bud as far as possible , you are basically raping your own ear .. they finally broke two days ago , all of a sudden the sound went choppy in one ear until it was gone .. less than an hour later the other ear bud died , it had something to do with the cable , right where it connects to my mp3 , every time i moved it around i just kept hearing choppiness .. over priced , weak sound , vmoda ? .. im going to buy some better electronics with better known brands that i have come to trust in the past ..  
1	  My family has already purchased two canon cameras in the past with no problems . I purchased the Canon PowerShot SD1000 two months ago . I was taking pictures at my friends wedding and the camera just stopped working . It wasn't dropped or abused . There were no signs of any abuse on the camera . I sent the camera to Canon to be fixed under the warranty and recived a bill for $ 103.53 . Canon said it wasn't covered under warranty . After speaking with Canon customer service , the price was dropped 20 % . I still have to pay $ 84.76 to fix my new camera . I went on the website to pay for the repairs . The website let me type in my credit card information and then told me it would not take my information . So in the end Canon still has my camara and has a broken website so I can't even pay for the repairs . Things I have learned : -A Canon warranty dose not cover the camara-Canon customer service is only there to listen to the customer complain , they can't fix problems-Canon repair website is broken a lot  
2	  I bought these headphones for my three-year old son during long car rides . He enjoys using them , and they seem to be comfortable . The ear cup is not quite large enough to entirely surround his ears , but it fits over the top and rests on the lobes . The padding is good so I don't think this will be a problem . He has worn them for several hours without complaining , and even fell asleep in his car seat wearing them . The band is very adjustable ( even I can wear these ) but they still fit him snugly . A volume limiting attachment was shipped with the headphones , and works . Although , when using the limiter the device volume has to be turned up very high to be audible . I think the cushion on the ear cup helps reduce road noise , etc . I would like to see sturdier cord , especially where it connects to the ear cups , but it has not been a problem yet .  
2	  These SD cards worked as expected in my trail cameras . The cards I was using were larger capacity and the cameras did not work well for one reason or another . The manufacturer reccommended 2 GB or less for optimal operation .  
2	  Printer is great ! Two paper trays mean you are not constantly changing paper . Also , my choice for printing photos . You can use a gray ink for black and white photos . I currently have three different printers and the HP 6980 is my favorite .  
1	  Can't say too much about the product itself - it was a gift and I haven't heard anything negative about it , so it may be decent . What irks me to no end is that two weeks later I got a call referencing my purchase of this product and then an " amazing offer " of some coupon books where they would charge my credit card $ 1 now , then a monthly fee until I unsubscribe . Every time I steered the conversation towards that charge , opting out , or not wanting to participate , the lady on the phone drove it back towards how great the offer was . It took several tries to get them to take " no " for an answer . If you purchase this item , be wary of where your information could end up . I don't know if it was the company directly , or if they sold it to a third party , but apparently they already had my credit card information on hand , which is a bit unsettling . I will be monitoring my credit card statement closely .  
2	  This thing does it all , music , radio , movies , pictures , and can even be used as a storage device , and it does them all very well . It is very portable , but still too bulky for your pocket . Controling the device is very easy and intuitive , and I have yet to have any problems with it .  
2	  Item as described . Received my shipment super fast . Would do business with again . Can't beat the low ptices . Beats paying $ 25 or more for same item  
2	  By far the best price with Abon Enterprises . my hp printer doesnt take refilled cartriges . so the ink could be really expansive . good deal . thanks Abon .  
2	  can't go wrong with good sounds and a great price ; use them for secondary set of stereo speakers in the living room , good crisp sound and sufficinet base , don't need a subwoofer for these .  
1	  Worked fine for a month . Then it stopped reading some discs . Now it won't play anything . " Disc cannot be played . " Even on brand new movies .  
2	  When I had Comcast Cable installed in my house a few years ago , the installer said that the wiring was old and may need to be replaced in the future for the higher bandwidth needs for cable Internet and On Demand HD . The previous owner had used an amplifier as well , but a one-way signal for standard cable . After getting errors on my digital cable box ( no problems on the Internet side ) and replacement boxes ( the repair techs didn't say anything about weak lines , just replaced the box ) I decided to try a 2 way amplifier . I recently purchased a HDTV and was hoping to enjoy the HD on Demand movies Comcast offers . Sure enough , after installing the booster ( in the attic , then splitting the signal 4 ways after the boost ) I am not having any problems getting On Demand HD in the living room , On Demand SD in the bedroom and Cable Internet in a spare bedroom / office . Easy Installation , definitely worth the price . Quick shipping from Amazon , definitely 5 stars !  
2	  All I can say is that I simply love this amp . It is worth every penny if you are looking for A LOT of BOOM for your buck . But be warned this is a very high out put amp and will easily blow any competition subs if they are not a true high RMS watt sub . I am running Solar Baric L5 's with the amp running just over half and it is simply heart pounding , ear bleeding , a punch in the chest total onslaught of bass rattling the pictures off my neighbors walls the next block down . If I knew this amp was gonna produce the amazing power it does I would have gone with Higher wattage subs or sub . I still am debating on throwing a Memphis 18 " in the trunk and turning this amp all the way and watch my trunk lid fly off its hinges . Highly recommended if you are looking for an extreme amount of power . This amp at 1.3 ohms pushes around 2400watts rms and peaks over 3300watts . If you want you subs to last make sure they are rated very high RMS wattage not peak wattage . example If you subs say 2000w peak but only 500w RMS you will melt the voice coils right out of them at 1ohm .  
2	  This is a good little desktop switch but I 'd recommend their Gigabit switch instead if you can spend just a little bit more . The gig switch offers more bang for the buck as long as you 're using gigabit adapters and cables with it ( which I am ) .  
2	  This Clarion equalizer is the best I 've ever had . I don't even have a head unit hooked up to it . I just run my ipod straight into it . The sound is powerful and clean . The soft blue illumination that glows from behind the knobs is very nice and not overpowering at night . The connections are all gold-plated so they conduct all the power and sound to it 's maximum potential . LOVE THIS PRODUCT !  
1	  This does not work at all . Tested it both ways . Product designed to project a Component Source to a VGA Monitor . Monitor reads a signal , but no picture comes out . Tested it on Monitor and TV . This means while a signal is present , the cable does nothing to output video . Made me waste $ on collaborating products too ( which all worked perfectly ) . AVOID / DO NOT BUY . not worth the postage for a return .  
2	  Well made - very rugged - lots of room . What can I say - Pelican makes as great product . I will buy more of these . EDIT 10-23-2012I bought another of these for mics and stuff . Love this case !  
1	  I bought this scanner a couple of months back and of the scanners I have ever used , this would take the spot as the worst . The software really stinks - the folks who designed the software that went into this must live on another planet . The scanner is sloow . I bought HP as all the scanners I 've used have been HP - but I am currently looking around to try and replace this scanner .  
2	  I wrote a review about this company that was not correct . They took care of a problem that was not there fault and I was more than happy with them . Thank you for your understanding .  
1	  1st time i used it i noticed it was junk , its wobbly at the link , and terrible sound , cant turn my radio to high because i dont want anybody outside hearing how trash it sounds n it keeps dropping reception  
2	  Wow , there is a video option to write this review . I wonder what that is all about . Sounds too complicated . This drive is awesome . It 's built rock solid and looks nice and hip . It is super quiet and only makes a soft low hum . The drive surprisingly doesn't click at all when writing or reading files ( very impressive ) . Most drives will make the clicking or grinding sound , this one doesn't . This drive is very reliable . I was a bit skeptical about buying a drive from a no-name company that is placed horizontal , but i guess they know what they 're doing because i haven't had a crash or drive failure yet . My sister purchased a maxtor that died after a year . I was also surprised to find that most post houses carry g-tech or lacies as opposed to any other brand . I also absolutely LOVE the white LED glow that 's above the g-tech logo . The white LED glow gives it the feel that it runs the way it looks , ice cold to the touch and smooth and cool .  
2	  Within just 10-15 minutes of comparing the Logitech V450 with a Microsoft 3000 , I noticed that the 3000 simply feels more natural , more substantial , and more supportive in my large paw than the V450 . ( The V450 , however , feels like it 's heavier and thus a smoother tool to use , probably due to taking 2 AA batteries vs . the 3000 's 1 AA battery . ) Here might be some reasons why the 3000 fits better to me : - The front ( button ) half and the rear ( supposedly palm rest ) half of the 3000 's top surfaces slope at a greater degree than the V450 's . - The tallest point of the 3000 probably is shorter than the V450 's , but is situated more towards the buttons than the V450 . - The 3000 appears oh-so-slightly taller than the V450 along the front edge , above the buttons . - The side rubber grip surfaces also feel better with the 3000 . This combination of very subtle physical dimension differences somehow seems to give the 3000 an edge over the V450 for big hand / long finger support . I have more places and ways , in more hand positions , to adequately " rest " my 4th and 5th fingers with the 3000 vs . the V450 . Also , wheel scrolling with the V450 feels crippling - which can't be good , since that 's my clue that prolonged usage may result in lovely things like CTS and what-not . Strangely still , the V450 is the longer mouse , with a taller ' peak ' and a longer button surfaces . Although the Logitech V450 gives me more of a kick , because of the laser precision tracking ( mouse movements feel more organic than the 3000 - and I could probably make good use of it on glossy Starbucks tables ) , of the battery metering , the weightiness , the cool , slick USB micro-receiver ( * half * the size of the 3000 's ugly one ! ) that slips surreptitiously into the slick , black underside of the V450 , and that the V450 actually comes with 2 AA batteries ! , and its superior fit and finish over the 3000 ( the fit and feel of the 3000 seems it was injection-molded out of some sub-par industrial-strength manufacturing process ) , I must * very reluctantly * go with the 3000 , even though I 'm not the biggest MSFT Hardware fan . So , there you have it , You Big-Hand Notebook User .  
2	  I purchased this item based on the reviews of other purchasers . Maybe I am too fussy , but I think the sound is a little ' tinny ' .. still , it is capable of producing adequate sound in a small room and the price was reasonable . It didn't work when I first set it up , but the unit battery was absolutely flat .. charged it up on my computer , tried again , and it worked just fine . And , I think I may be able to tweak the equalizer to generate better sound on future recordings .  
1	  It 's [ bad ] . I have one . I wish I 'd been given another make or model . Batteries last about 10 minutes , and I 'm not talking [ bad ] batteries here . The data sets loaded into it are a complete waste of time , they 'll just about tell you which country you 're in .  
1	  I purchased this SD card because it was " recommended " on the amazon web site for the Kodak digital picture frame . However , the card doesn't work in the frame , or my computer . It may only need to be formatted , or it may not be compatible .. I wouldn't know though , because after 3 phone calls and an email to the customer and tech service " answering machine " and email account in the past week I have had no response ! It is really poor when you buy a new product and can't get in touch with the company for support . The card comes with absolutely no instructions or reccomendations  
2	  I was helping my father set up his wireless network when we found out he could not get any reception in his living room . Part of the problem was that the wireless signal had to travel through several walls and a fairly long distance . The setup for this item was very straight forward and completed within a few minutes . Once connected the reception jumped from poor to no reception to a fair to average reception . I would highly recommend this product for those experienceing poor quality reception with their Linksys wireless LAN . Even though this booster does have some limitations , it is definitely worth a try if you are getting poor reception in some areas of your house .  
2	  This is a great little TV that seems to do everything well . The picture is pretty darned good as LCDs go-it is very brilliant and crisp , although in common with all LCD screens that I 've seen it sometimes is less-than-perfect for dark scenes . The built-in speakers are mostly OK , although you in my opinion the set benefits significantly if you use bigger outboard speakers . This is a great choice for limited space applications . I installed mine in my boat , and I love it ! The kids love it ! We use ours mainly to watch DVDs , and it is great for this . Panasonic quality is a joy to behold , and this TV hits the mark . Recommended .  
2	  Was advised by Tivo to get this for my HD series 3 boxTiVo TCD652160 HD Digital Video Recorder . My Tivo box was in a constant rebooting cycle . When I contacted tech support and we started troubleshooting , I happened to mention that I had just recently upgraded my Fios service to their highest tier . Checked the signal strength and it was coming in 100 mbs and it shouldn't be over 90 . They said that my cable signal was way to high for the box to be able to process it and that I needed to reduce it by using an attenuator . So that 's why I bought this and really does work ! My Tivo works fine now .  
1	  I absolutely loved my camera at first , but then , like other reviews , I was cursed with the black screen of death . The camera was on , the lens was out , but the screen was completely black . When I attempted to take pictures despite the black screen , they didn't turn out . Nothing seemed to fix this problem . I do have the warranty , but again , you have to pay to have this repaired . The worst part about this is that the screen decided to go black while on my trip to NYC and I had to buy disposable cameras instead . Don't let this happen to you !  
2	  I had the BOSE speakers for a week and tried everything with them in terms of placement and equalizer adjustments , but they consistently had this annoying boomy , unnatural midrange sound that I noticed right off the bat . Finally I took them back and got these very cool looking JBL 's , and I was impressed right away with the clarity and full range sound they had . Playing both Death Cab For Cutie and Bill Frisell , the sound was stellar . I think I 'll be keeping these ! ( However , my BOSE cd player in the living room has been awesome for over three years now , to be fair . )  
2	  It was suspiciously easy , for a USB to parallel port device . 1 ) Connected the Parallel end of the Dynex to HP Laserjet 4p . 2 ) Made sure printer was ON , RESET TO DEFAULT SETTINGS , and ONLINE . 3 ) Plugged in the Dynex USB end into the computer . 4 ) Printer and Dynex were recognized instantaneously . HP LaserJet 4p appeared under printers , and I was able to print immediately . Too good to be true for a device that tries to bridge the gap between two different technology eras . I have seen reports that people had trouble with HP Printers , even 4p . Well , the problem must have been something else . Make sure you plug in the Dynex to the printer first . Also , make sure that , if you manually mess with PRINTER PORT settings in the printer driver , you go for the USB Printing port .. it may be USB001 or USB002 , try them all . I had to do none of that , however . Everything set up automatically , correctly , the first time .  
2	  I bought this unit from Amazon over a year ago for my parents . They travel to Europe a lot and wanted to play their Region 2 DVDs at home . This player does a great job of converting from PAL to NTSC and playing both Regions 1 & 2 ( I have not tested any other Regions ) . When my Dad can't get his $ 400 Panasonic DVD player to play a DVD-RW or some other unusual disk or format he just puts it in the Philips and it plays . It has never let him down . I have made a lot of home videos on many different types of DVDs and this player has played them all . I can't believe that for $ 70 ( last year 's price ) I got so much value . It still works like a charm , which is more than I can say for the Paanasonic DVD players I have bought over the years for much more money . I plan on getting one for myself this week .  
1	  every other time I try to use this headset , it becomes possessed . It won't turn off , it won't respond to anything , and it won't connect to anything .. it 's a real pain and there 's no way to reset the thing . I have to wait for the battery to run out when it 's on standby which takes days .  
2	  I have used this product for my computer monitor ( 22inch ) for around 7 months . The mounting screws that came with the product are cheap and were not used , I went down to the hardware store and bought some nice heavy duty ones . Overall for the price of this , it can't be beat . The allen adjustment screws are a little on the cheaper side , but do function well for the price , I have it mounted on the wall just a bit sideways and they seem to have held up well in time .  
1	  i bought this item , listed as " new " from " shopcell " . what arrived in the mail could hardly be described that way . i received an fm transmitter that was not in any sort of manufacturers packaging ( unless thats how you describe a ziplock baggie ) and came with " instructions " that appeared to have been xeroxed multiple times over . i have no way of telling if this item is actually new , refurbished or just used . there doesnt appear to be any cosmetic damage , and have yet to see if it even works properly . price aside , this was a most frustrating purchase . i guess you do get what you pay for . i use amazon less than some other online retailers but really thought they did a good job of managing their sellers . maybe i was mistaken .  
1	  This product did not work in my Blazer . The result was excessive static . Amazon was good about returning it .  
1	  My main gripe is that this card WILL NOT work with Window 's new Media Center Edition . You have to install it first to find that out . Follow that up with poor video quality and a totally inadequate web support function and you have a device that 's below average .  
1	  I bought this looking for a cheap camera to put up pictures on the web . 1.3MP ( 1280x960 ) should be more than enough for that . However , in 1.3MP mode , this camera takes awful blotchy photos . I suspect this camera 's CCD actually uses far less than 1.3MP and interpolates up to that resolution , since the photos this camera takes don't lose any apparent detail when downsampled to 640x480 . In fact , I keep mine set at 640x480 all the time , because that 's the only way to get decent detail out of it . Bottom line-this is a toy camera .  
1	  It is not a good product . I 've bought it from Best buy . It works for 2 month . Best buy doesn't take it back . Samsung does not replace it . Anybody have a box for this number and could give an adress from box . Where I should return it ? Lilia  
2	  I bought a Voodoo3 3000 PCI some time ago and then upgraded to a Voodoo5 5000 - This was great but my new machine does not support it - so I put back in my old PCI Voodoo3 expecting a real let down and I can tell you it 's a pleasant suprise , Quake 3 , Unreal , Alien v Predator , Star Trek Armada II and Kingpin are just some of the games I use and they run superbly - No juddering , freezing or glitching just smooth good quality action . Now 3dfx has been bought out by nVidia look at the .. site for excellent new drivers which keep this amazing card bang up to date .  
1	  I bought this cooler among several others , and I found it to be the worst of 5 different coolers in my performance testing . I found that this product resulted in a thermal resistance of approximately 1 Kelvin / Watt . Typical values for coolers in the same price range are . 4 to . 6 K / w , depending on the technology used . Despite the product description , this will not effectively cool your components . There are better budget VGA coolers out there , and if you are looking to overclock , don't even think about buying this product .  
1	  Yamaha clearly indicated on the box this drive runs under Win95/98 / ME / NT / 2000 and the SUPPLIED SOFTWARE RUNS UNDER NT . However the included packet writing software Nero InCD does not support NT 4.0 . The Yamaha tech support was not helpful and said it was Nero 's problem . It IS Yamaha 's problem . Do NOT pretend the SUPPLIED SOFTWARE runs under NT when it does not , at least now .  
1	  Hahaha , is the signal supposed to improve just because you buy a 10 ' gimmick ? The phone signal travels through hundreds of feet of cheap two-strand unshielded bell wire and through thousands of feet of plain ol ' copper wire before it ever reaches your M M M MONSTER C C C CABLE . What , is that last 10 ' the only part of the wire that is suseptible to deep space pulsar interference and radioactive laser noise ?  
2	  Very easy to use . Expend my wireless network access from two marginal to five with very good signal level . No external power required . Highly recomend it .  
2	  I debated for a long time between purchasing this lens versus the more expensive L-series . I know that I made the right choice after using this lens for about 2 months . It has given me tack sharp images up to approx . the 275mm focal length but softens slightly at full length . It is easy to mount , moderate weight and has excellent 2 mode IS capability . Sample shots are posted .  
1	  These headphones sound WORSE than the one 's that came with my Ipod touch . There is no low frequency response . Turn the volume up and you have piercing high frequency only . I regret purchasing these headphones  
1	  Upgraded from the dinosaur " B " wireless hoping for some speed . Hookup went smooth , no problems , but no extra " speed " to speak of . Called Tech Support ( phone answered in the Phillipines with terrible lag ) . Told me if I got 54 Mbps that was the best it will give . I asked about where the " Speedbooster " was that I paid extra for , sorry , I was told must be interference , phones , walls , etc . I was on the cordless phone at the time but the 2nd computer was in the same room with speeds of 11 - 34 Mbps . Save your money , " Speedbooster " sounds neat but does not deliver .  
1	  purchased tomtom720 and and a garmin nuvi350 for my wife this past xmas the 720 features are much to be desired if i don't take the route it wants me to keep making u-turns where the nuvi tells you its recalculating and finds the next available route automatically and the poi 's don't even exist ask for a dunkin donuts shop tells me 20 miles away where as the nuvi has them all in my town and even all the local resturants to where the 720 doesn't the nuvi came with a case where as the tomtom i had to buy one nuvi tells you you in advance turns coming up the tomtom tells you at the last minute totally disappointed with the tomtom and i did try to upgrade the poi 's were the same ones  
1	  I purchased a Canon Powershot A710 7.1MP Digital camera and it is not working properly . It keeps telling me to change the batteries . I have had the same exact camera before and bought this one because I dropped my other one and broke it , so I am familiar with the camera . It is definitely a defect . Every time I turn the camera on , it tells me to change the batteries . I have tried different kinds of batteries alsom , and that 's not the problem . I would like a refund from the seller .  
2	  This amp does what it is supposed to do . Only thing I wasn't aware of was that the AB speaker switches don't allow output to go to both speakers at the same time . Maybe this was in the write up but if so I missed it .  
2	  Purchased the Home travel Adapter for my Creative products . You can't beat the price for this item . And the bottom line is that it works .  
2	  Pretty much what the title describes . Bought August 24 , 2009 . Have been constantly it using ever since it arrived . Construction quality seems pretty good as I have twisted around the doors in my apartment to get it from living room to my bedroom . So got it for about 13 bucks , lasted more than a year , can't ask for more .  
2	  Hey , great ball for my practice rounds and they 're inexpensive . A little soft on the drives , behaves nicely on the fairways and greens . If you lose it no sweat . I drive with an Iron so only 4 stars because it stays flat off the tee a little longer than I prefer , may be different with a driver though .  
2	  I work in hot glass and have a ventilation system that sounds like a jet engine , plus the torch , a noisy concentrator for oxygen and my parrots are in the building also ( fumes ARE exhausted for all you pet lovers ) . The parrots love the noise and try to outdo it . My poor ears ! I tried working without the headphones and I just couldn't concentrate and my tension levels skyrocketed along with sore back and shoulders etc . I put these on with my little Sansa and listen to classical , soft pop / rock , gospel and radio shows and I LOVE LOVE LOVE them . I am relaxed when I am through torching . My ears do not hurt from wearing them for hours . If I ever take a transatlantic flight these will be my best friend on that journey . I recommend them highly . Lorraine ChandlerRed Bluff , Ca .  
2	  after experiencing mild signs of carpal tunnel presumably from using my laptop keyboard 8 hours a day , i switched to this product and it has surpassed my expectations - no more wrist problems  
1	  There is a defect that shows up after about a year of use wherein the unit cannot record video anymore - all other functions are retained , including audio recording . Sony will charge you over $ 250 to fix it .. stay away from this model ..  
2	  I 've owned this camera for more than 2 years along with my SLR film cam . Its been a great camera and I 've taken more than a thousand photos with it and got great prints ranging from sunny beach shots to pitch black cave pics . Unfortuanely , thats where I crushed it just this past weekend .. in a cave , but my pics where still saved ! Of the reviews I 've ready , most have problems with the batteries . Its a digital camera .. of course it will use batteries ! Show me one that doesn't . Thats why you keep spares and I have yet to have them last less than a month . Also , you don't have to reset the program if you change the batteries out quickly . Just dump out the old ones and pop in the new ones . You can do that in less than 10 seconds . The same goes with the SD card . I do it all the time . Quit whining and bad mouthing this great product . Its a great camera and I am getting another one .  
2	  This product works as described . If you need more USB ports and have PCI slots available , this will add 4 more to your PC .  
1	  I found the Olympus binoculars hard to focus . When I do get them to focus they are worth the price .  
1	  This webcam does not work well with windows xp , ( Home and Professional ) and windows 2000 . Software given is old and outdated . whole package is not worth for money . Logitech is much better in quality . Stand is really a pain . Moreover technical assistance and other customer service are really bad . Will Never buy again from creative . Company sucks .  
1	  The packaging for this device states " Handling the cords of this product will expose you to lead " and you should wash your hands after handling the them . Would have been nice to know this before purchasing . It 's Made in China , you got to love it . You also won't see this warning unless you use a magnifying glass .  
1	  Well , I bought this cable and ran it through a wall . after hooking it up to my AV Receiver , the cable bent slightly and the whole connector broke apart into a unrepairable mess . The connector is quite cheap and will break apart .  
2	  I bought this player primarily to watch DVDs while on flights and it certainly does the job well . The picture quality is excellent and the battery charge lasts long enough to view 2 movies . The battery is not a standard battery , however , and you will have to buy another expensive Panasonic battery if you want a spare but I haven't found this necessary yet . I haven't found any negatives at all with this player other than the proprietary battery , and that is a very minor negative considering the length the charge lasts .  
2	  I bought it mainly for traveling and took it to Phoenix on my last trip to use in my rental car . I would follow my daughter to where we were going and then I could select their home so we could return separately without her having to make sure I was right behind her in the traffic .  
2	  This one works seamlessly with both my cable modem and router . Just have to plug in , now i dont have to get tied down by wires . the speed and signal strength is good . Strongly recommend this product if you have a wired router / cable modem or DSL modem .  
1	  I received the power cord and it worked great for about a week then abruptly died . Had the system admin at my work test it and it was completely dead . I tried to contact the seller to return but was not able to return the item . I had an electrician look at it and he opened it up and found that it was not an actual Toshiba product but a cheaply made FAKE . Thanks for scamming me !  
1	  We bought this brand new a year ago and used it very little . The remote broke over the Christmas season , so I emailed customer service . They said no parts , including remote , are available , which makes the whole system unusable . You have to have a remote to turn it on and off - no power button on the unit . I bought new batteries , thinking it was just a dead battery , but no , the remote died . $ 150 about a year ago and completely unuseable system today , which no option to replace the remote .  
1	  I recently purchased Envision 15 " LCD Flat panel . Big dissappointment ! The back light of this monitor was completely off . On the top the screen was very dark and on the buttom too bright . There is no way to adjust the back light to evenly illuminate the screen . Sent it right back ! WHAT YOU PAY IS WHAT YOU GET .  
2	  After doing research online about which Palm to buy , I discovered that the Vx is the best . Below is a list of what makes it so much better than the other Palms . It has the latest version of the Palm Operating System V3.5 . It has the most accessories out of all the Palms ( folding keyboard , modem , acoustic modem , memory expansion plugs into port , and more ) . It has the most memory ; more memory than the Palm VII that has internet access . It is the smallest and lightest . By attaching a modem to the Palm Vx and hooking it up to a cellular phone , it is the same thing as the palm VII but has more memory , is smaller , lighter , has more accesories , and is better looking . There are hundreds of software titles to choose from , allowing people to organize anything they could possibly think of . I would definately recomend the Palm Vx .  
1	  When considering the Expander , be careful if you have a WRT54GS rather than the WRT54G . I had all the problems described by others , but unfortunately the ' GS ' version adds another level of complexity , probably because the firmware between the " G " and " GS " differs . Even tech support had me try firmware for the " G " version without success . The Expander also introduces another level of complexity if the DHCP Server is disabled on the router because the existing network has its own DHCP server . There is a work around for this problem ( basically setting the TCP / IP to a static address and using 192.168.1 . x settings for IP and Gateway ) , but you 'll never find the explanation in the Linksys database . Installation of the Expander can be almost as difficult as installing a network . Moreover , if you purchased the WRT54GS for added capabilities , you may have purchased 3 pieces ( router , laptop adapter & expander ) that are virtually useless because of the greatly reduced functionality without the necessary range . This review is written after having spent 4 + hours with persistent , friendly , and unsuccessful technical support .  
1	  We bought this computer in 2004 and had it repaired for a loose power jack in 2006 ( symptoms : loses power either sporadically or completely ; eventually destroys the motherboard due to arcing at the power source and simply won't start ) . It took months to repair because it came back with a faulty keyboard and had to be sent back . Now , again , the power jack is loose . Looking online , I see this is fairly common for HP notebooks ( as well as for several other brands ) . But HP doesn't " recognize " this problem and therefore won't recall it or offer free repair or a work-around solution . It 's common for manufacturers to attempt to blame the consumer for moving the notebook around too much or for pulling out the adapter at an angle , or whatever . But we didn't even move this HP zv5120us notebook / laptop since it was last repaired , except for maybe once . Hey , you should be able to move the darn thing ; it 's a LAPTOP ! If people want something to be done about this , they need to contact HP and complain . I did ; unfortunately , they are just parrots that can only repeat that the problem is not recognized as an issue and that I can pay for a repair ( hundreds of dollars and weeks of time lost . ) The one work-around that I saw people talking about online , an all-in-one media entertainment cable , is said by HP technicians not to be a real solution , as the power supply still arcs inside and will eventually cause damage / failure . Even if you want to try it , this cable is currently not to be found , at least not at the retail price of $ 40 . You might find it on Ebay for many times that - probably because of all the HP owners trying to get around the loose jack problem , not realizing or caring that it 's a temporary fix at best . Thanks for letting me express my frustration . Maybe it will help to caution potential buyers , and maybe some people who are experiencing the same issue will contact HP to let them know it IS a " recognized " problem , at least among many of their customers . I 'm big on consumer rights , and I feel it 's just not right for HP to be in denial at the consumer 's expense ! ( Other weaknesses that we have noticed : The paint finish wears off very quickly ; the dvd player stops sometimes while watching . )  
1	  I work as a media specialist for a company with 50 branches across the country . We are looking to replace all of our VCR 's with combo units . I didn't have to keep this model on the bench too long before determining it was junk . I will say the DVD side was very good and it played every type of disk I put in it . The VHS player ( at least on the one unit I tested ) could not maintain tracking AT ALL . Squiggly lines dominated the picture , especially when viewing large text titles . I tested the VHS tape on several older VCR 's and it looked fine on all of them . Received and returned this unit on the same day .  
2	  The Kodak Klic-8000 battery fits snuggly in the charger . It charges the battery quickly . The folding wall plug is a nice feature , no power wart to plug in the wall socket . Also handy is the 12 volt car adapter . I think it is nicer that the Kodak charger .  
1	  I 'm wishing I had read a few of these reviews in advance of our purchase of the HP 2550 nine months ago . I 'll simply reiterate what several reviews have already mentioned - reasonably priced machine ( $ 499 ) , BUT , my small organization doesn't do a huge amount of printing , and we now have to replace the imaging drum at $ 399 ( Can ) . I would have appreciated " user-friendly " information ( mind you , from both the big box that sold it to me and the manufacturer ) that clearly indicated the 1 year warranty doesn't apply to the drum , and that with normal wear and tear , you 'll replace the drum frequently ( and that it 's very expensive to replace ) . I would have appreciated knowing that there was a way I could have extended the drum usage by changing a relatively simple default setting ( so it doesn't " eat " the colour thereby reducing the wear on the drum ) . Expensive lesson learned .  
2	  I love mine and I 've had it for 5 years and it still works beautifully . But .. I don't use the CD function . I bought it because it has all the other features I wanted that I couldn't fine in a non-CD alarm clock at the time of purchase . 1 . Gradual wake2 . Dual alarm settings3 . Nap function of 2hrsMy cons : 1 . buttons are very small and it 's not easy for a new user to quickly hit the off button . Of course alarms have a way of quickly motivating the user to learn with deadly accuracy ! 2 . the motorized CD tray is loud and slow to think . I 'm not surprised about all the other reviews complaining about it lasting if you actually use it daily as an alarm .  
2	  I own the mini duffel bag ( black ) . It is my favorite bag to carry around with me to the gym , at work , or for leisure around the city . It 's small enough for a purse and deep / wide enough to fit my shoes . It has cool compartments for my ipod , my cell phone , my camera , pens and make up bag . There 's also a zipper compartment in the front . The material is long-lasting and the dimensions are GREAT ! I highly recommend this bag and will probably get this bag for my friends as gifts !  
1	  Though i got the item in time , i do not think my battery holds any charge at all . without being connected to a power supply , the computer does not even powered on ! i think i bought it !  
1	  specs were great , so I decided to give at a try despite the warnings from others . Now I 'm returning it back . First , WinDVR won't install on my XP Pro system . In the very beginning of the installation it gives " remote procedure call failed " and aborts . MSI web site has the same faulty version . Intervideo doesn't want to deal with this issue , " If you need OEM ( bundled ) support for an Intervideo product , please contact the OEM for that information because we do not provide exhuastive support for OEM versions of the program " Ok , downloaded the latest version of WinDVR 3.0 . This one installs and seems to work . And what do I get from the MSI card ? - Just a beautiful blue screen on all channels .

2	  I purchased the Samsung HL-R3266W 42 " television from Amazon . com after much research and viewing the t . v . at area stores . The DLP offers a clear picture and is easy to set up . The idea of its longevity appealed to me and having to replace the light bulb occasionally isn't a drawback . The price is high , but was $ 500.00 less from Amazon . com than the big box stores when I ordered it . It arrived in less than a week in perfect condition . I recommend the Samsung DLP very highly .  
2	  I used the Nuvi 370 in December 2007 when for a business trip that brought me to Germany , Austria , France and the Netherlands . The map and the mapping software is very accurate . As expected , the pronunciation of non-American streets is incorrect but that is to be expected . The important thing is that as soon as my rental car left the Frankfurt International Airport , the GPS was up and running immediately and brought me to many beautiful European cities . Tips for a better experience : 1 . Put a drop of water ( say from your Evian bottled water ) on the suction cup before attaching it on the windshield . This will prevent the suction cup from falling . 2 . SLOW DOWN when you are about 2 or 3 miles from your exit . It 's way to obvious but the reason why most people miss their exits ( even with a GPS ) is that they are driving way too fast . No , it 's not the GPS 's fault . The Nuvi 370 is absolutely worth the money . I 've used it the US too and it 's been flawless so far . Bottomline - works as advertised . The other most important thing that the unit has is the currency and unit of measure converter . The others ( mp3 player , bluetooth ) are regular add-on , not too impressive but maybe useful for other folks .  
1	  I hated the way it tunes , keyboard only , It would be ok if you know all the frequencies you want to listen to but I like to & # 34 ; cruise & # 34 ; the airwaves . The scan function was so slow and just didn't seem to work very well . It worked fine when I knew the freq . and keyed it in but that 's not what I like to to do .  
2	  This product has worked well so far . I needed the ability to extend the cables that runs from my elation copilot 3 to the corresponding power boxes it controls . If you 're lost already google & # 34 ; Elation Copilot 3 & # 34 ; . It will clear up an confusion . The lighting controller only came with a 25 foot cable and a 10 foot cable , which is fine if you are less than 25 feet away from your light truss and you are only using a standard 10 foot truss . I now have the ability to use two light trees and they don't have to be right next to my DJ booth . A great investment to my company . Also this was one of the few places I could find 50 foot lengths where the cable was black in color too . Not grey or tan , because that always looks classy in a DJ setup . Not ! One of the better prices I found as well . Keep up the good work !  
1	  I had this radio about six months and the SD card reader went out . Poor reception for the radio leaves me with buyers remorse . Go with a better brand . Stay away from Boss . I swapped it for a better radio .  
1	  Perhaps I got one of the first ones off the assembly line , because I have encountered nothing but problems over thirty months of use . Using the WPC-11 PCMCIA cards , I have encountered constant connectivity " hangs " over the months , always requiring me to hit the reset switch on the back of the unit to regain a connection to the Internet . Too late to return the unit and 3 wireless cards - stuck with the thing . Downloaded and successfully installed 3 firmware upgrades to no avail , including 1.39.2 , 1.42.7 , and 1.44.2 . Tech support , somewhere in India or Pakistan , told me my chip set is damaged , even though the unit has been plugged into APC UPS with filters , etc . for the last 30 months . When the unit did work , I never got better than 30 foot range . Beyond that the signal would degrade to the point of no connectivity . Company unwilling to offer a coupon or discount on latest and greatest unit , so I 'll move on as you should . A Dissatisfied Customer  
2	  I don't understand people talking bad about this rangefinder who are using it for golf . Do you use a fork to eat soup ? The difference between a hunting rangefinder and golfing rangefinder is a hunting is made to look for the farthest object instead of shrubs , trees , thicket that may be in the way of your target . ( You are usually hunting in the woods and don't need the range for the closest tree ) Golfing rangefinders are programmed to find the distance of the closest object since objects shouldn't be obtructing your view of the tee . This is a very simple to use rangefinder and great for hunting game . * Only buttons are power / scan button and mode button . Hold mode while finder is on to change between yards or meters . Press the power button to turn on . Acquire your target and press again for reading or hold it to scan objects in the distance . Unit powers down in 8 seconds if no action is taken . * ProsSimpleAccurateWORKS * ConsEye relief could be larger for those who wear glasses ( if you don't .. not a problem ) Conclusion : Great rangefinder at a great price ( comes with nice belt carry bag too ! ) If you are looking for a golf rangefinder .. look elsewhere because this is NOT one .  
1	  I don't give this unit even one star but , I had to enter a rating to continue . I bought the VR2940 approximately a year and a half ago through " Vanns " . Well , initially the unit worked fine , but , after about two weeks it started to freeze while recording videos and becoming unresponsive to button presses of any sort . I would have to unplug the unit , which , of course , would make me have to reset the clock and everything . So , I emailed GoVideo about it just a couple of weeks after I bought it in July . By December I had sent three emails complaining that something was wrong with the unit and had called twice . Each call ended with being told that they would mail me the Loader Version Upgrade CD 's and that should fix it . I should have received the CD 's by Christmas 2005 but hadn't so I went on my trip and assumed that I would receive them by time I returned . No such luck , and , when I called them back after New Year I was then told that they don't mail out Upgrade CD 's anymore . Then , after mentioning that I would just send it back and get my money back I was told that the warranty was expired . I asked the person if I could speak with whoever is in charge , I was told that nobody was there . I asked if there was nobody higher up than him and he said no . I said , " So you 're running everything over there then ? " He said no . In total frustration I ended the phone call and had planned to see a lawyer about it - After all , I spent approximately $ 350.00 to buy the " YesDVD capable VR2940 " . Now I have a $ 350.00 VCR with an inoperable DVD player ( It will only play some music CD 's and won't even spin-up to accept the Loader Version Upgrad CD 's I just burned with the new CD Burner I bought for this reason using Nero 6 ) and there 's nobody out there to repair it . NEVER ! NEVER ! buy anything that has " GoVideo " in the name . NEVER .  
2	  So probably the reason why you are reading the review for these exceptional speakers is one of the following : Rather high price compared to the Logitech products , Rather Simple Design , Lack of Subwoofer . I would like to say , Dont worry about it ! As a frequent music listener and who use my Laptop to stream movies a lot , I highly recommend these speakers for those who are looking for a basic , simple installation , taking up little room , has aesthetic beauty , and good sound quality speaker . Yes it is a little pricy , but these speakers with its design and its mediocre heaviness makes sure that Bose has brought something exceptional for your use . As an owner of the Bose Quiet Comfort series as I do frequent flying , I enjoy the sound quality that Bose has to offer . I do recognize that some may argue that Band & Olufsen ; and Sennheiser have a better sound quality .. but this is a simple laptop / desktop speaker we are talking about ! If you are looking for sound quality , I recommend the higher level speakers such as those recommened by the reviewers below . BUT , if you are looking for a speaker around $ 100US that perform well and fit firmly into your desk and possess easy portability compared to other speakers with same quality of sound , this is the answer . Enjoy listening . P.S. ALWAYS LOOK FOR " Amazon verified purchase link " under poster 's name ! Haters gonna hate =)  
2	  This laptop case is an EXCELLENT product ! Size , quality , strength all perfect for my 15 " laptop ! Enough room for quite a few files too and still more room should I need to stay overnight on business .  
2	  I 'm very pleased with this purchase . I 'll never again buy binoculars without this feature .  
1	  Looks good but doesnt keep a charge more than a couple of hours . might be good for a childs first in case they loose it or mistreat it but If a serious music listener , may want to spend the $ TO GET IT NEW .  
2	  The audio card works just fine and I 'm very happy with it . It 's not top of the line but it is a very decent step up from integrated on-board audio .  
2	  I PURCHASED IT A AWHILE BACK AND HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO USE IT OFTEN . MY PREVIOUS SUB WOOFER THAT I REPLACED NEVER HAD AN ON / OFF SWITCH AND EVENTUALLY DIED OUT . THIS ONE DOES AND BEING A SONY INSTILLED MORE CONFIDENCE IN MY DECISION TO BUY IT . I HAVENT BEEN DISAPPOINTED . NICE SOUND GREAT PRICE . COMPLIMENTS MY SYSTEM NICELY .  
1	  This lamp deserves a minus 10 star rating and even that might be too high . This lamp blew out twelve ( 12 ) days after it was installed . When I went through the process to return it , the seller , Lamp Monsters LLC , wasn't anywhere in the loop . Amazon , not the seller , refunded the purchase price and shipping . After looking at it closely as I was packaging it to send it back , I found it 's not from Sony but some cheap , poorly made after market piece of junk manufacturer . Don't be lured by cheap prices on what appears to be the real deal from Lamp Monsters LLC - if it looks too good to be true it will be junk and Lamp Monsters LLC will be selling it .  
2	  I bought this at the last minute for my disney trip . I mainly use a stella from epiphanie , but my stella wasn't big enough for my disney vacation . I carried my gripped 7d with lens attached , my 70-300 , 50 , 18-55 , 85 & 580exii as well as many little odds and ends . 4 days at 13 + hour days , and my back wasn't hurting , great backpack , great quality , and tons of room ! I still had left over spots for lenses !  
1	  These headphones have great bass but overall sound quality is barely acceptable and comfort is terrible . Midrange is kind of muddled and highs are weak . The silicone earpieces have ridges on them from the mold which are very uncomfortable in my ears , and despite there being three sizes none of them form a dependable seal . ( The seal is necessary for noise reduction and vital for sound quality . ) The foam earpieces are relatively comfortable but one of mine expands so fast that I cannot properly put it in and I have to constantly fiddle with it . I could go on but I feel this is enough . I wouldn't buy them again even if they were almost free .  
2	  Just got my yesterday with latest firmware and City NavigationEasy setup and beautiful deviceAmazon is the best  
2	  Hmm .. this product fulfills its advertised function . Holds memory quiet well , without umm , leaking it .  
2	  My sound card died in my emachine and this was the perfect solution . Just plug it in and away you go . No need to use the Disc , Vista installs it as soon as you plug it in ! The sound is amazing , highly recommended and way better than paying for Geek Squad to replace my internal card ! As an Amazon Prime member , I was a little apprehensive as [ .. ] were shipping this and in my experience they take forever , but this took 4 days from order to delivery ! 5 stars all the way .  
2	  The Tripp Lite Isobar Ultra first drew my attention when I went to work for a local communications company . I noticed that in every one of our offices and in almost all of our customers ' businesses , equipment was plugged into one of these puppies , from the smallest they offer to the largest . I have witnessed lightning storms that have literally blown sockets out of walls , and yet the equipment plugged into the Isobar has remained intact . Granted , some of the Isobars didn't fare as well as the equipment they protected , but they did their job . Having witnessed the quality of this product , I trust it in my own home . Everything from my computer to my entertainment center to my paper shredder is attached to an Isobar Ultra . I highly recommend it for it 's quality and performance .  
2	  I purchased this product as a generic alternative to the more expensive Sony original . The two memory sticks are so similar that they may as well have been from the same manufacturer - I can detect absolutely no difference in performance between the two . The Sony memory stick format is useful but somewhat overpriced , so it is a real pleasure to find such a reasonable alternative . Strongly recommended  
1	  Lots of coasters ! I contacted Verbatim with no response . Awful product support ! I 'm using a new Dell 18x burner using Nero 's newest version . Stay away !  
2	  The Olympus DM-10 is incredible . It is unlike anything you have ever used before . The sound at HQ & Stereo HQ recording mode is outstanding . During a lecture , you can sit in the back and record , and what you play back is 100 % understandable . Even the SP and LP modes will record clearly , but you probably won't use it , because SHQ and HQ will spoil you . As an MP3 music player , I think it sounds better than a portable CD player . My DM-10 came with stereo earphones ( earbuds ) and a stereo condenser mike ( ME51S ) . I was reluctant to buy it at first , because of the $ 150 price tag . But once I got it and started using it , there was no doubt as to why .  
1	  Do not buy this printer for any point of sale activity . It prints very slowly even on the draft setting . The machine also eats toner ink quite fast . Outside of that I guess it is alright .  
1	  I made the mistake of purchasing this router . File sharing , internet access and the wireless connectivity work fine but I use my home network for online games . I tried to configure my new router to allow me to act as a server for several different games . The online documentation is very sparse , as is the KB on the Netgear site . I sent a question to their support staff , asking for expanded documentation on port-forwarding . After getting a canned e-mail response asking for my serial number ( which I had already provided ) , I was told that this question " fell outside of the scope of support " , and I would have to pay $ 28.95 ( or $ 1.95 / min ) for " Premium Support " . This is almost 30 % of the price of the router itself for a single support incident . It 's too bad that 1 star is as low a rating as you can make . I will never buy another Netgear product again .  
1	  I have a SyncMaster 793MB which you can not use because of brown lines that appears . First I thought it was spesific to mine . But I had seen many SyncMater 793MB with the same problem .. So Samsung sucks .. How they can let this .. Obviously this is a production error .. They should annouce that they will change all 793MBs ..  
1	  All I need to say is that the static it produces is too much to bare , your better off getting a cassette transmitter if your car can play tapesThis fm transmitter $ 18 - staticCassette transmitter $ 4- perfectly clear , NO static  
1	  I purchased this item for a Windows Vista Machine . There was no information regarding compatibility . It will work but you can only use the speakers to which it is attached . You can not use the pc speakers and the stereo speakers at the same time . You must first unplug the USB transceiver in order to use the pc speakers . Logitech has no updated drivers for Vista .  
2	  To be honest I was very skeptical about this product when I first ordered it . There are many component cable splitters out there and there didn't seem to be many that lay between the super cheap and the ultra expensive . Well this unit was reasonable in price and did exactly what I wanted it to . No noticeable drop in signal strength , easy to use and relatively small . I would suggest this as an economical way to run multiple displays from one source without the need to take a loan out to do it .  
2	  This CB radio has an outstanding performance , but beware of the low volume on the internal speaker , just as an advice you should also buy an extension speaker , there are a lot of low priced Midland extensions on amazon  
2	  This monitor works well , but I 'm having problems using it with my Macbook because it interferes with the WiFi signal , drops down to 2 bars or less , and sometimes drops out completely . I 've called the Apple Help , tried to adjust the Airport channels , and it still doesn't resolve the problem . This wasn't an issue with my Mac Mini , but perhaps it has better shielding than the Macbook . Both computers are running Leopard . I 'm using a Mini Display Port to DVI connector ( even tried the MiniDisplay-VGA connector , but had the same issue ; plus it looks awful on the monitor ) . A workaround is that I plug in the connector , close the Macbook , wake it in clamshell mode , then open the Macbook lid again . The Macbook screen stays dark , all the screen elements show in external monitor window , and I get full bars on the WiFi strength display . I 've read other issues with Macbook / Macbook Pro WiFi issues with Samsung monitors , but this one has been around for a few years , so maybe it 's not as much of an issue for newer Samsung models . Other than the compatibility problems , the monitor has worked flawlessly . Not as crisp as my Macbook screen , but still nice to have a bigger monitor .  
2	  I can't believe how inexpensive this cable was . My husband had bought a 6 ft cable at a local big box electronics store , and it was $ 26 . I found this online , bought it and took back the other one that we hadn't opened yet . He tried it out last week using it between his iPad ( with the converter of course ) and the TV at his hotel . He was really impressed with how well it worked .  
1	  At this price it should work out of the box . A. The driver as-shipped did not work and messed up installshield . B. The driver downloaded off the site did not initially work by simply running an install . For those who insist on trying this product . The sequence that worked is install the driver WITHOUT the device plugged in . REBOOT . Plug in the device ( this could be difficult - see C below ) Additional install steps occur automatically ( it would be nice if this was documented anywhere . ) . REBOOT . The device should now work . ( I think . ) C. The unit I had appeared to have either a bad cable or a bad connector inside the product . The USB connector is buried deep inside the product . IT is difficult to get a good mate . The cable fits the recepticle poorly . D. After about 4 hours work , I was actually able to try all of the features of this product . When you can get a good connection it appears to work as advertised . E. When we called tech support ( during PST advertised business hours . ) we got a recording . I generally do not like dealing with " tech support " for something that should just be a simple install and plug-in . Getting an anwering machine during regular business hours was the last straw .  
1	  I have a 2003 Mazda 6 S and the FM transmitter does work but I have to turn the radio all the way up . I tried turning my iPhone 4s all the way up but that doesn't help . It sucks when paring because for some reason that initial beeb transmits so loudly it actually hurts . The mic is the worst .. NO ONE can hear me when I answer a call so that feature is useless . You can imagine how frustrating that is when trying to use it with Siri ! The LED display just went out on me after only three months of use . It has been super nice weather ( 60s and 70s ) all three months so there 's no way it is causes by heat . I 'm requesting a replacement so let 's see how their customer support is ..  
2	  I know this amp doesn't push that much power or anything but I love it . I just sold my old sub which was a dual 2 ohm kicker L5 12 " , which I ran 450RMS to and the amp never even got warm . It slapped really nice for just being 450 watts . I have a kicker cvx ( dual 4 ohm ! ) coming right now so that I 'll be able to push 650 RMS to it .. Can't wait . Love this amp . Such a good product for the price .  
2	  Several years ago , while visiting a college roomate , classmate and friend of mine in upstate NY , I was introduced to these binoculars . I could not believe the clarity with which I could see and focus in on objects : birds , etc . My friend is a birder , I am a " wanna-be " . I 've used these at concerts and in the theater , too , where my wife and I were not close to the stage to see the performers , their costumes , the setting props , etc . I strongly recommend these to anyone who is looking for a good and reliable pair .  
1	  the device itself is very nice and packs interesting features , . The accompanying instructions and software , I bet that the peoples who developped it were working out of their backyard . It 's simply worth a shiitt .  
2	  Ok so I guess I 'm a bit biased - I 've been using Palms ( and earlier PDAs ) for a long time . I 'm 30 now , and I started using PDAs when I was 16 ( yeah , I 'm a computer nerd ) . I 've been able to keep the same memos , address book , and date book for a very , very long time . Through many different Palm devices . As long as I back up the data , I 'm good . I just bought a second Tungsten C here actually , as a backup in case my primary one gets lost , stolen or broken . Specifically , I love the Tungsten C because of the keypad . I mean , don't get me wrong , I learned Graffiti a long time ago but I 've never liked it . I constantly tried to find the ' perfect ' replacement that had an actual keyboard / keypad , and with Palm , those are very few and far between . The Tungsten C is the one for me . I 'm not going for WebOS as I hear nothing is backward compatible with PalmOS . I don't even use the wifi feature as their web browser is horribly outdated , and installing Opera is near impossible even though there are sites that show you how to do it . The wifi kinda stopped working on mine anyway , showing a consistently stale list of available access points .. whatever , I just turned Wifi off and now I have a great PDA that is disconnected from the world ( which is what I wanted anyway ) . My love for Palm 's simplicity in their primary applications ( addressbook , memopad ) and my love for the few third-party apps ( Strip , Datebk6 ) is what keeps me from thinking " well , my cell phone has most of this functionality , why don't I just use that ? " I 'll tell you why . Because my wife washed my cell phone the other day . I 'm probably going to upgrade my cellphone , and with the market / technology changing so quickly , I 'd be crazy if I thought I could retain almost 15 years worth of data in a device that is going to become obsolete in a year . Palm sidesteps this with their older devices in that they are so PLENTIFUL to obtain and so insanely COMPATIBLE that you could pick up any old Palm and be able to restore your data easily . I own a technical consulting and support business , and use my Palm for appointments , tasks , addresses , notetaking , keeping encrypted passwords for various clients , etc .. Thinking that a cell phone SHOULD do these tasks , I have found , is just insane . I want to keep them separate so I 'm not tied to a certain cellphone for life . My Tungsten is my # 1 receptionist - I rely on it for everything , even now in 2010 . Palm devices have never let me down when it comes to the necessities of a true PDA , and the Tungsten C is the best of breed IMHO .  
2	  After the crash of my computer 's hard drive , I was encouraged by my tech to purchase an external hard drive to back up my files . After reviewing several drives , I chose this one . It works great . Easy to install and up and running in no time . Takes up almost no space on my desk and the lightbar in front lets me know it is always available . My computer holds hundreds of photos that I would hate to lose so this drive gives me another level of security . P.S. the tech was able to salvage all but one corrupted file . Lucky me .  
1	  Don't think for a moment that you 're going to get high fidelity sound with these headphones . You 're better off buying a small mp3 player / fm tuner with wired headphones . Some of them even allow you to wear the device on your arm , getting you most of the freedom that these " wireless headphones " offer . I bought these as a Christmas present for my wife , and we 're both very unhappy with the sound . Also , the 900mhz frequency was of some concern , and it turns out to have been with good reason . We have a 900mhz cordless phone which uses " DSS " ( digital spread spectrum ; it does frequency hopping ) . It turns out that the headphones pick up a very frequent " click " noise which must be a result of the cordless phone 's transmitter going past the same certain frequency over and over again . But even ignoring that issue , the sound is just not what we 're used to from our mid-range consumer stereo and other experiences listening to consumer grade walkmen , cd players , and corded headphones on our hi-fi .  
1	  I ordered this cable specifically because it was WHITE . It has WHITE in the name of the product . The image looks white . The cable isn't . Its grey . There are lots of " white " things around it like thepacking slip that clearly are justified to be white . So I 've been mislead and am not very happy ..  
2	  This is such a great product . The case fits my camera perfectly and I love that it comes with an extra battery and a tape . This is just perfect for a first time owner like myself !  
1	  It should be noted that despite the fact that this unit is advertised as an Etrex handlebar mount , it dies not fit the 20 model . The package comes with a replacement battery cover , which then clips onto the handlebar mount . The battery cover for the 20 is of a different configuration and therefore this mount does not fit . If you own the unit you can see this from the picture , however I bought both together as suggested by Amazon expecting they were compatible . Amazon - you need to be more explicit in your description .  
1	  I 've never owned or used a worse piece of electronics . When used in my home , the sound cuts out during the slightest voltage sag ( e.g. the light that comes on when the fridge door is opened ) . It also randomly and abruptly starts producing static for which the only remedy is to turn it off and back on . However , NONE of my many other electrical components experience the same problems . When used in the car ( professionally installed by Circuit City ) , it usually only produces static . I have to repeatedly turn it off and back on until it finally starts working . I 'd guess that it works about 1 out of 7 tries . I tried calling Audiovox technical support and they were totally useless , telling me they 've never heard of these problems before and couldn't even offer any suggestions for a fix . I replaced both the receiver and the cradles under warranty from Circuit City , but the same problems remain . It 's junk , stay away . Update : Since I have the Circuit City extended warranty , I was able to trade in the SIRPNP2 for the new SIRPNP3 . I 'm happy to report that Audiovox has apparently fixed all the problems mentioned above . It works great so far .  
1	  We purchased this product just over a year ago . The battery began to discharge very quickly and then eventually the unit shut off . We now cannot turn the unit back on . It 's dead .. dead .. dead . We plug it in using the power adapter and an AC adapter we purchased . Apparently , there is some sort of switch defect , which causes the power switch mounts to break easily . Because our limited warranty just expired , we 'll have to send it for repair , which is now almost the cost of the device new . The number of times we used the power switch is not many since we generally kept it plugged in and running in the car . It mostly shut off automatically . However , when the battery once discharged because we did not have a power cord , we finally had to use the power switch . If someone else has suggestions as to this problem , let me know . I give it two stars because when the unit did work , we enjoyed it and it lead us in the right direction 95 % of the time . The UI navigation is pretty easy to learn and use . I would have preferred a QWERTY keyboard . Maybe this is an option , but I could not find it . That 's probably in the manual right next to where it says " don't use the power switch too much . "  
1	  We 've had the TV for a couple of years . Now it turns off on its own . Phillips recommends we buy a part that will cost more than $ 500 to replace . After 2 years ? No thanks . I can replace the entire TV for that . Worst TV ever . I won't be buying a Phillips product ever again . Before you buy this TV , search the web for all the complaints . You will be amazed . Better yet , don't buy Phillips .  
1	  For some reason I thought this cable would fit an HP PSC printer , it does not . I searched for the printer I have and this came up .  
1	  I had the older version of Moster FM for iPod . It failed after 5 years . I got this as a replacement . However , it is disappointment . ( 1 ) Sounds worse than the older version from the car radio ;( 2 ) it fails in the middle and I have to unplug to restore it ;( 3 ) when it is plugged , it plays automatically ( which is fine but not prefer ) ; however , it didn't stop if I unplug or stop the engine . This cause my iPod to play even after I left the car . The old one worked the other way around . ( 4 ) Don't even want to mention the auto scan , it suck . I can pick a better station than it does . Bad news :( 5 ) It won't charge iPod Touch , iPhone , and new gen of iPod Nano  
1	  The details about this product is a bold face lie . It says that this dvd player will play all regions , 1,2,3,4,5 , & 6 . So , I bought it so I could play a dvd that I purchased from the UK . When I opened the dvd player the manuel says that it in fact does not play all regions . Only dvd 's marked region 1 and all region . Bold face liars . I am so upset ! Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for allowing misleading advertising on their website .  
2	  Easy to install ( color coded cords ) very powerful sub woofer amazing crisp sound THX certified .. great system for this price only cons : real heavy sub woofer and no wireless remote other then that great buy !  
1	  I find that most of the prior criticisms are accurate . Most of the cool extras , the media sliders , the little screen , etc . are " gimmicks " that don't work properly and offer little functionality . The keyboard has a nice feel once you get used to it , but if you let it sit for more then 5 minutes , it must go into some kind of battery conservation mode and when you type something it repeats the first letter keyed . I have not been able to find and disable this " feature " . The chief problem is the mouse . I simply have never had a Bluetooth Wireless device that really worked . The mouse inexplicitly hangs and stops working . This problem will continue for seconds or minutes at a time . Sometimes you must open the mouse software and fiddle with the connection settings . The mouse also is heavy and feels blocky in my hand . That 's a personal preference though . The unit does look great however , and if you rank style over substance you might like it . If you are like me and are trying to get as much done in as little time as possible , having to stop and fiddle with something as simple as a mouse is unacceptable . Finally , be careful installing the included software . It includes a lot of unnecessary and undesirable media software which wants to run in the background , bog down your system , and continually try to direct you to Logitech pay sites .  
1	  Watch out ! This is a SCAM ! They will send you the newer model ( 7B ) even though you pay more for the older version . If you will be stuck with the newer version , you might as well buy it on Ebay for $ 119.00 and not $ 146.00 . There are so many complaints about this switch-a-roo , and nothing has been done to stop these retailers from scamming others . Watch out ! Audio-Technica ATHANC7 Noise-cancelling Headphones  
2	  I have a T61p that I just installed a newWestern Digital 320 GB Scorpio Black SATA 7200 RPM 16 MB Cache Bulk / OEM Notebook Hard Drive WD3200BEKT [ Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging ] into the laptop , so had the old 200GB lying around . I noticed this , and thinking that I don't really use my Multi-Burner all the time , that this would be a cheap way of having both drives in the machine at the same time . Installation was super simple , the bay just holds the drive in a clip , so no screws required , and it is hot-swappable with Windows 7 , ENT that I am running on the machine . I have installed Ubuntu 9.10 on it and it dual boots nicely with Windows . A great addition to an older laptop ..  
2	  I have this for my home theater and it works great . positive switch with lockout on the knob so it 's solid . Only downside is having to get up and manually changing the switch when I want to use another device but worth the money .  
1	  I wish I could recommend the AT-PL120 . It 's got a great feature set , a very attractive price , a decent hands-on feel , and what seem to be good mechanical components . Unfortunately , the hum some others have reported in their reviews was present in the one I got - and it was not user error , as has been suggested . Using phono-out ( turning off the internal preamp ) to my receiver or a separate , external preamp , the hum would start the instant the turntable 's power was turned on . Using the table 's own preamp into my receiver 's line-in or a set of powered speakers produced an even louder hum . I checked out the house 's electrical circuits and found nothing wrong , and I ruled out a ground loop by using the same circuit for the turntable and whatever I was connecting it to . Then I listened closely with headphones and found that the hum was louder on the left channel and varied somewhat with the tonearm 's position , and that pretty well pegged it as an internal problem . The hum wasn't terribly loud , but I found it annoying and unacceptable , especially in a brand-new turntable . The AT tech who responded to my emails was courteous and offered some reasonable troubleshooting suggestions , but the problem persisted , so I cut my losses and sent the turntable back while it was still possible .  
2	  great stable tripod . i have a heavy kodak dslr-c camera in portraite position its like a rock thanks amazon and adorama grest price and shopping experenceBogen-Manfrotto 3021BPRO Professional Tripod without Head ( Black )  
1	  Save your money order something else . How can a AC cord not work on anything ? Weird , Shaking my head , dang  
2	  those who think the vision : m is bad are those few unlucky ones who received the rare DOA players . I 've scraped it on the pavement , dropped it multiples times and had it bounce , and left it in my car in 103 degrees weather . I 've even kicked it . It still works great . Albeit , with the occasional glitches in accessing the key pad . But with all I 've put it through , it 's a miracle the thing hasn't just exploded . Can those popular and flimsy players stand up to the abuse ? And of course the screen is great , the sound is great , and the radio and recording features are great .  
1	  I really liked the design of this unit but it failed completely after about 90 days .. just stopped working . Other types and brands of hubs connected to my iMac work just fine so I 've no idea what happened to this one . Wish I could recommend it as I had high hopes , but I 'd go with something else .  
2	  If u r like me u hate having to mess with computer network settings and using new software to make your pc accessories work . I have 2 pcs that use 1 printer . I simply installed my printer driver on both pcs , plugged both printer cables from my pcs to this switch box , a cable from swi box to printer , and it 's DONE ! One pc uses button " A " and the other uses button " B " . U can switch on the fly . Super easy and very basic . Great for someone who wants to do this the simplistic way and not spend so much money .  
1	  I purchased one of this company 's products and I have NEVER encountered worse customer service . The 800 number rings and rings and when it finally answers you are on hold forever . When you finally get through to the tech support department , there is an operator who takes a message under the guise that someone will actually return the call . When someone finally called me back ( after I repeatedly called them to check the status of the callback ) , the person could not have been in a bigger hurry to get me off the line . When I followed his instructions , my computer locked up and then he said he could'nt wait for me to fix my computer so he hung up . He actually hung up on me ! I could'nt believe it . When I called this company to find out the name of the President , the person answering the phone was reluctant to provide it . When I asked for the President 's e-mail address and address so that I could send a letter , this person refused to provide it and also hung up on me . If you are stupid enough to purchase this product after my experiences , all I can say is that you better know what the hell you are doing because Linksys certainly will not help you .  
1	  I used to be a big fan of Sony 's vertical in-ear headphones . 10 years ago , they were the best thing on the market for their price . To make the long story short , Sony simply doesn't make them like they used to any more . None of Sony 's current vertical in-ear headphones are worth buying unless you get them for free . Save yourself money and frustration , and buy yourself a pair of Koss Portapro 's for about $ 30 . You will get exceptionally good sound quality , portability , and lifetime warranty ( compared to Sony 's 90 day ) . Long Story : Around year 2000 , I bought a set of Sony MDR-A34 vertical in-ear headphones . The build quality and comfort were phenomenal . Sound quality was much better than that of any headphones that came bundled with portable electronics ( including Sony 's own Walkman players and radios ) , and these headphones could take some serious abuse . Around year 2005 or so , I accidentally snapped the cable of my A34 , and bought another set of them . The new set was just as good and lasted until year 2010 when I finally lost them . Unfortunately , Sony discontinued the A34 series around year 2007 . So my choices were now W24V and the A35L . I was averse to buying the A35L because every second reviewer claims that the headband snaps broken on the first use . So I bought the W24V instead . Before even using these headphones , I was really disappointed when I saw the thin , flimsy plastic headband . The thing provided relatively little pressure to support the headphones on my head . Given the $ 25 price , these headphones look surprisingly cheap . Sound quality is also pretty sad . The A34 used to have 15mm drivers , but the W24V have 13mm drivers . Compared to the old MDR-A34 , I can tell that W24V offer more detailed sound and volume , but bass is completely gone . All-in-all , I was convinced that what I got with W24V is equivalent to your typical under-ten-dollar department store cheapies . However , even that rating was too premature and optimistic . After one month of light use , the left side driver stopped working . This appears to be a common issue with all Sony 's current vertical headphones . I highly recommend one to get a set of Koss Portapros instead . You will be surprised how much headphones you get for so little money , and forget about Sony 's cheap stuff .  
1	  Unfortunately not as good as I hope it would be . Connector often gets stuck in the port , and with some systems ( ethernet cards ) just doesn't work at all ( surprised ? I was too .. ) .. i.e. doesn't go all the way into the port . I probably will have to cut the connector and attach a better one .  
2	  This is my second GPS and it was very easy to get use to and now I have started comparing this Magellan to my Garmin , and in many ways the Magellan is better .  
2	  These are so great ! I saw them in the Apple store about two years ago for a lot more money . For $ 40 on Amazon they were a super deal , which I pride myself on finding . I am really picky , but the are so pleasing to the eye ! Can you believe it .. speakers that double as sculptural elements ? ! The sound quality is quite good , especially if you 're used to speakers without a sub-woofer . The volume goes up quite high . I haven't even felt the need to turn them up enough to be at full blast . I will be using them with my laptop as well as my iPod . They will be replacing my big home stereo , which I 've hardly used since I got my iPod anyway . The power cord has quite a large " brick " attached . I hope I can hide it behind my desk or TV stand . Also , the on button is in a pretty awkward place ( behing the sub-woofer , among all the cords ) . I don't understand why they didn't put it on the left speaker where the volume buttons are on the right one . Still , I love them !  
2	  In this review I am going to talk about my experiences with the Belkin F5D8230-4 Pre-N router and its companion , the Belkin F5D8010 Wireless Pre-N card . But first , let me talk about my experiences with routers in general . I have owned a half dozen routers throughout my home computing years . All of them have been Linksys brand simply because I always felt that they were the most reliable router company for the home consumer market . Up until recently , I have never had a single problem with a Linksys router . In January 2006 I bought the Linksys WRT54GX4 which was touted as their newest most powerful flagship router capable of broadcasting Internet at high speeds throughout a large home . This was important for me since I have a very large house with multiple levels and a deck outside - all places I would want to access the Internet from via my laptop . The Linksys WRT54GX4 actually worked rather well for the first three months UNTIL I purchased a duo-core IBM Thinkpad laptop and started experiencing all sorts of problems . After a week of research I discovered that the Intel 3945ABG network card that is installed on most Duo-Core laptops has a compatability problem with certain Linksys routers . So , if your laptop is having such problems connecting to a Linksys router - you now know the deal . I had to find a new router . It had to be powerful and it had to be easy to configure . Someone on one of the Internet forums I frequent suggested purchasing a Belkin Pre-N router . That person claimed that it did a great job broadcasting an Internet signal throughout his large home . I went to my local retailer and bought the Belkin F5D8230-4 Pre-N router . Now I must say at this point that the first one I bought was defective right out of the box . The wireless function would not work . Belkin customer support suggested I return it for another . Fortunately , the replacement worked perfectly ! Please don't let this experience deter your purchase decision as I feel the end result is worth the fact that sometimes these things happen . Let me also say that despite many negative comments I have read on the Internet , Belkin support was very obtainable over the phone , though the guy I spoke to didn't seem very knowledgeable about the product as he had to refer to his manual to address the initial problems I was having before determining I had a defective unit . Right out of the box , I was sort of surprised at the look of the router . Unlike the clunky Linksys I was replacing , the Belkin looked more like an elaborate paperweight . The design was more sleek and low-key than what I had seen in previous routers . One of the most amazing aspects of this router outside of its performance is the ease of installation . For most people including myself , router installation and configuration is one of the most cumbersome tasks you don't want to deal with . Well folks , I am here to tell you that Belkin has made the process an absolute no-brainer . You simply pop in the supplied CD and via a on-screen walk-through process , my router was working in under 5 minutes . This was far easier to install than any Linksys router I have previously used . Kudos to Belkin ! So let 's talk about performance .. The Belkin F5D8230-4 router performed just as I expected . It provided ample coverage throughout my home - no more or less than the Linksys router I had replaced . I was somewhat dissatisfied with the loss of signal in the farthest reaches of my home and on the outside deck , and I needed something that would boost signal strength . Enter the F5D8010 Wireless Pre-N card . Within days I ordered the Wireless Pre-N card hoping that it would increase overall coverage in my home as the manufacturer had promised . Upon arrival , I installed the software and then the card into the cardbus slot of my PC . Now this is important : many have recommended that you do not install the software that comes on the installation CD but rather download it off of Belkin 's website as it is more current . I took that advice to heart and had the software and card installed within minutes . Well , the Belkin F5D8010 Wireless Pre-N card did EXACTLY what it promised to do . My signal strength almost doubled . My WiFi strength meter went from 2 bars to 4 ( out of 5 ) . Surfing speed dramatically increased . It was almost as if my laptop was hardwired to the cable itself . I was now able to use my laptop in areas that I could not before . As expensive as this combination of router and card was ( about $ 200 ) , it was worth every penny to get this sort of coverage with absolutely no dropouts or disconnects . I would highly , highly recommend the combination of Belkin Pre-N router and PC card if you are looking for amazingly powerful coverage for a large living area .  
1	  This player does not play MP3 files on cd . I ordered it to play MP3 files and was very disappointed when the cds would not play :( .  
1	  Cynicism warning ! I consider printer manufacturers to be just this side of snake oil salesman in honor because of their continual efforts to screw you after you buy their printer with exorbitant costs for ink , etc . These labels are just one more exhibit in a long line of crimes by printer companies ! An analogy to illustrate my criticism and frustration with these rolls . In a bathroom , a toilet paper dispenser is screwed into the wall . When the toilet paper runs out , you remove the roll from the dispenser and you are set . Imagine your frustration if you had to replace the dispenser and the roll as a unit ! Well , guess what ! That is how these rolls are designed . The black plastic roll holder cannot be pulled apart for roll replacement ! Which means they can charge more , and they can try to rope you into buying only their rolls . I bought these rolls , and they work fine . I also bought just a roll without the holder from Eco-nomylabel that works very well .. [ .. ] Eco-nomylabel gives you help , listing 4 or 5 ways to work around the Brother dispenser that is inseparable from the roll . ( I cut the dispenser in two with a bandsaw , and I can replace just the roll now . ) Thumbs down to Brother for this scam .. Thumbs up to the quality of the labels ( to be fair ) ..  
1	  Combo sets itself to something you will never figure out . I should have read the reviews ! At least it wasn't on my laptop at the time . I had a Ken$ington lock that did this too , so I figured a completely different brand couldn't possibly have the same problem .. I mean , this is a truly fatal design flaw , and surely only ONE company would be low enough to continue selling a lock they know will cause customers headache and expense , right ? Not so ! I can only assume now that NO combination laptop lock can be trusted not to lock me out . So I 'll be buying a keyed one .. maybe that 's why those start around $ 30 , and the combos can be had for less than $ 5 . Please be smarter than I was .. don't throw away $ 5 .  
1	  My TV is only 4 years old and this is not compatible with it . It renders pictures very fuzzy and red from both the DVD palyer and the VCR . It has a buzz in the sound , doesn't have a remote , and is a huge disappointment . I really regret buying it , as it has failed on every level  
2	  As others have said , it works great for the price . I would have prefered automatic switching as I have in my HDMI switch but can understand for the price this is at it would be hard to do  
2	  It does exactly what it needs to do - keeps the controller clean and easy to grip . Not sure why there are studs on the front of the palm-rests as they don't seem to do much , but I don't mind them . Can't beat this price .  
2	  Whenever I travel I use this backpack to store not only my laptop but all my gear .. workfiles , stationery , books , clothes , EVERYTHING ! I love all the compartments so you can store your stuff separately . This is a rugged bag that takes a lot of licks and all you have to do is give it a wipe down and it is good as new !  
2	  This item is worth the $ . I bought one as a gift based on the Apple Store mgr 's suggestion . I liked the performance so much I bought one for myself . Spend the extra money , you will be very happy . Much better than the wireless hookup for the car .  
2	  Great transition camera from point and shoot to DSLR . I have had several point and shoot digital cameras from Olympus , Kodak , and Canon . The pictures were satisfactory , but after seeing photos taken with this camera , I was intrigued . This is my first DSLR camera and I 'm not a professional photographer . I 'm just a regular person who wants to preserve memories . I was looking for a camera that would take great photos and was easy to use . This camera fulfilled both criteria . Right out of the box it took beautiful photos and it 's very easy to use . It 's so fun to use I find myself grabbing it over and over to take pictures . I enjoy scrapbooking and these photos will enhance my scrapbook pages . So far I 've used the auto setting , child setting , and macro setting . Each worked great . My favorite is the child setting because it highlights the child and blurs the background a little bit . This camera is going to capture moments I would have missed with my old point and shoot . I ordered it from Amazon with overnight shipping because it wasn't very expensive and it was here the next day . This kit has everything you need to get started except for a SD card so make sure you have one on hand or order one at the same time so you can start taking pictures right away . This is the best purchase I have made in years !  
2	  The harmony remote connects to a computer using a USB cable . You then install some software on the computer and then navigate to a web site ( harmonyremote . com ) to configure the remote control . All of the configuration is dependent on this web site . On one hand , this is good in that this web site should always have the latest device commands in its database . However , the drawback is that you have to contend with a web / HTML interface and the wait times associated with a web-based application . Personally I think it would have been better to have a normal installed Windows application that can receive updates on new supported devices over the internet . Configuring the remote was not that easy but was possible . Basically if you have fairly " well-behaved " and well supported devices with no special characteristics or requirements , their wizards should get the remote configured quickly . But .. if you have certain tweaks you want to make then navigating through their configuration pages can be frustrating . For example , if you want to add certain device commands to the list of commands sent when an activity button is pressed ( activity = " Watch a Movie " ) , then you have to navigate through their setup wizard for the activity and then , at the end , choose from one of the 3 responses which dumps you to a configuration page that finally allows you to add commands . This page should be accessible directly - but isn't . Ultimately , though , despite the poor configuration UI and web site , I was able to get this remote configured the way that I want . The end result was great . It is a very easy to use remote once its configured . One of the things I hate about many remotes is that you have to give guests a tutorial on how to use them so they can operate your entertainment system . With this remote , its pretty obvious what to do to watch a DVD or watch TV , etc . I did get my remote as a Christmas present and , yes , as the other reviewers stated , Logitech 's site was overwhelmed which resulted in some frustration . I got frequent " High Traffic " error messages when first trying to configure the remote . However , ultimately , I waited for times where the web site was not so overloaded and did manage to get the remote configured . Overall , I 'm pleased with the remote . The end result was good despite some hassle in getting it configured . Once you have found your way around their configuration web site , you can get the remote tweaked they way you want it . I 've never had a universal remote that didn't require a lot of time to get it completely setup and tweaked to work they way I want . So all in all , I wasn't too disappointed in that . Pros :* The remote is phsyically designed well . It can be operated easily with one hand . When back-lit , is bright and clear . The buttons are all easily pressed . * It uses " Activity " buttons that represent what you want to do .. " Watch TV " , " Watch a movie " , " Listen to music " . additionally , you can create your own custom activities and name them what you want . So a guest can pick up your remote and fairly easily figure out what button to press to do what they want . * The LCD screen has 6 positions with buttons for each position so that you can create custom commands associated with each activity or device . There is a " Next " button below this so that you can have multiple pages of these custom commands . * It supports " discrete " commands such as Power On and Power Off and " Go to Video 6 " , etc . This is really important for the remote to be able to function without making assumptions about what the current state of the devices are ( e.g. If a device is already on and it needs to have a device on for a given activity , it won't send a " Power toggle " and inadvertantly turn the device off . ) * You can control whether switching from one activity to another turns off the other unused devices . * You can specify if some devices should always be left on ( i.e. a cable box ) * You can add additional commands for any devices * It can learn any commands that it doesn't already know fairly easily . Cons * It relies on a web site and applications that are launched via the site to configure the remote . This means that you have a combination of web pages and downloaded applets that run when you need to update the remote . The result is a clunky interface that is inferior to a normal Windows app . For example , in a normal windows app , a wizard would let you simply press " ENTER " to next through the wizard but the HTML based web site requires you reposition your mouse every time over the next button to get through them . Generally I think web based apps are inferior to Windows apps . Even still , they could still make their web site easier to use . Its too indirect and too wizard - based . Wizards are ok for initial setup just to get things mostly configured , but when I need to go in and make tweaks and refine the configuration , I don't want wizards . I want something more straightforward . * One of my devices is a Sony Receiver . Its a model that is only about 3 years old but it didn't seem to be in their database . I had to learn the commands I needed with the original remote and head to head learning . Its a Sony - not some cheap off brand no one has heard of ! * Yes their web site was overwhelmed during the holidays - very frustrating * When you first take out their CD , you 're prompted to install their software . But as soon as you go to the web site to start configuring , it tells you there is updated software and you have to manually uninstall what you just installed ! It doesn't even do it for you or simply update what you have .  
1	  I only bought this cable because the price was cheaper . & # 34 ; you get what you paid for & # 34 ; that 's exactly what i got . The cable does not stream very good when i connect from my laptop to my 40 & # 34 ; Samsung TV . The movie or anything that i am watching would just black out every 2 min or so . It is so frustrating . i am not satisfied at all . All the stores i checked had very expensive cables . For 25ft it is very good price actually for the frustration is not worth . so i am just gonna have to buy from one of the stores .  
2	  I recieved the item in good condition . The item was drlivered within the time given to me .  
1	  I would not even give it to a child it is a piece of crap . Horribly cheap product that not worth it .  
1	  This card does not work on many Dell notebooks . I tried a Dell Inspiron 9300 and 1100 . If you dig deep enough on startech . com there is an incompatibility list but you won't find it until you have spent several hours trying to get this P * S to work .  
2	  I bought the VX800 back in November 2002 . After 5 + months of usage , it 's been a great monitor . Married to a dual processor Macintosh w / a 64MB video card , this monitor has performed flawlessly . No shadows , not one bad pixel - not one bad thing to say about the quality of the monitor . But .. a couple things worth mentioning . First , the speakers that come with this monitor are barely adequate . Good for basic sound but that 's about it . And finally , this was my first LCD monitor ; knowing I 'm paying more then I should when compared to other quality LCDs with the same warranty period and bad pixel policy . With that said , there are monitors just as sharp as this VX800 for much less money . If you 're comfortable buying an LCD with a top of the line brand name , ViewSonics and Samsungs are who to turn to . But when I buy my second LCD for my other computer , I 'm going to look very closely at LCDs from Hitachi and Envision . These two companies make terrific LCDs with great warranty / bad pixel policies for significantly less money . You won't go wrong with any VX series LCD , but you 'll also do well spending less money for the same quality buying a Hitachi or Envision . This VX 800 gets 5 stars based solely on the quality of the monitor . If price was to factored , I 'd drop the rating to 4 stars .  
1	  You get what you pay for . Don't get these earphones unless you try them first . I haven't found a person who feels their comfortable in their ears . Sound quality is pretty good , but not nearly has good as high quality earphones like shure & zen earphones .  
1	  the first day with the unit i wasn't actually using it in real world conditions , just sitting in the garage trying to find four stations that appeared to work ok to put into the memory . that done , i put it in the glovebox and went back inside . the next day on the way to work , i found that i was getting a lot of static on all 4 of those channels .. except when i reached over to pick it up to change stations ( an accident in the making , as another review stated .. ) as long as i kept a hand on it , the reception was not cd quality , but probably about the same as radio quality . after a bit of thought , i looped the headphones a few times around the transmitter 's cable , then strung them over the passenger seat 's sun visor , and i haven't had to mess with it since . so , clearly the device wasn't tested very well , it does need a longer antenna , but you can makeshift a reasonable solution .  
2	  For the money , this card is hard to beat . It uses a more elegant method of 3D rendering that saves memory bandwidth , the limiting factor of all modern graphics cards . [ .. ] The more overlapping mountains , buildings , bots , trees , etc , the better the relative performance of this card becomes . It is better than any of the MX cards I have seen . [ .. ] I was using a Prophet 4500 to play the game " Black & White " this afternoon and it was amazing .  
1	  at first i too was impressed with the fast printing of this printer but less than a year after buying it i had to have the whole printer replaced . no matter how many times i cleaned the print heads there were white lines throughout the printing . so it was replaced and now only 5 months later i have the same problem as well as the fact it is rejecting ink . the first two cartridges that this happened with i thought it was the cartridge but 36 dollars later for ink , i figured out the printer is messed up AGAIN . most of the time i 've had it , the printer prints fair to poor . you have to clean the print heads all the time and alot of times which wastes money . i never know , no matter how much i clean the print heads , if when i hit print the page is going to be ok or be a mess . i am afraid to use nice paper as i don't want piles of misprinted expensive paper . and i so do not love that because my printer is rejecting color inks i can't even print black and white . the genius engineer who thought that one up should be shot . please stay away from this printer , and in my opinion , epson . this is the 2nd epson printer i have had and the first was a problem too . spare yourself the grief i have had .. i am off to take it to repair again since i spent money on the warranty . i suspect kicking it down the stairs would be more productive .  
2	  I have been using this bag for a few years now while going to school . I carry a Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop in it and it fits fine . One of the main pocket zippers separates sometimes ( happened about 5 times in two years ) . Would be nice if there was a pocket to carry a water bottle .  
2	  Yes , it 's expensive . Yes , it 's for a machine that is long outdated and probably no longer supported by the factory . Supplies for this machine is starting to get a little hard to find , so finding normal consumables like the toner is a great ( considering that the machine will still make great copies and that we got the machine for free ) . Only thing is that cost on consumables on this machine is high ( toner , imaging cartage , etc ) , so we will probably retire this machine when this toner runs out .  
1	  I 'm sure this review will get lots of negative feedback , but I don't care . Someone has to let people know what a piece of garbage this product and the WUSB11 are . I bought this sometime in Febuary and there hasn't been a day where I haven't had to do something extra to get it to work . These things may include unplugging and plugging back in the WAP11 , my router , the internet cable connection , or [ messing ] with the settings , or giving up in frustration and reading a book . I 've spent , no joke , at least 21 hours with the tech support line , and the vast amount of that time is waiting on hold with a repeating voice telling me that they 're having unusually high traffic and that I should be patient . Well , it 's simply no wonder they have such high volume when they produce this kind of junk . I 'm at the end of my patience . The first time I called , I got disconneted , maybe by the tech support guy because he couldn't figure out my problem . Then the second time I called , the device worked for about a week before it went down again . The third time I called back , we went through completly different steps to get it to work again , and it worked for about another week , almost hassle free . The fourth time I called back , I was told my problem was a known issue , whatever the hell that is since they didn't tell me what the problem was , and they told me to send my product back for a replacement , on my dime , nonetheless . I get their replacement , and I swear to the heavans , it worked for about a week before it started doing the same kind of [ thing ] the old one did . Things like seeing the network connection , but not connecting , working for 10 minutes at a time , then going down for the day , moving the WAP11 or WUSB11 across the room and going out for the day . Oh , and if you like to play video games over the internt , things like Unreal Tournament or Return to Castle Wolfenstein , prepare to have the game freeze every minute for 3 seconds . Now , that may not sound so bad , but it really [ isn't nice ] when it freezes and you wake up dead . I suppose this is another known issue that they have no solution for . Now , you may be saying to yourself , hey , this guy is an idiot who knows nothing about technology and computers . If it doesn't work then it 's probably his own fault or ignorance . But , then I 'd tell you how I have a degree in computer science and am a professional programmer and feel very comfortable around things such as this . This thing simply doesn't work . I 'm supposing that for the people it does work for , they must be in the same room as the WAP11 , but in that case you don't really need a wireless connection . So , heed my words , don't buy this if you don't like to live every day in fear that it 'll not work today . Linksys should issue a worldwide apology to every customer who bought this .. and refund my money since they can't refund my time . I 'm certain they 've taken years off my life with all of the frustration they 've cause me . And if you 're wondering why I gave it 2 stars it 's because nobody takes seriously one star reviews . On a scale of 1-10 , this product should get a negative infinity . I 'm not joking , this thing is that bad .  
2	  form fitting , excellent sound and comfortable . this product is a bit over priced and the price is constantly chamging so buy it when it is around $ 35 because the price jumps between 35 and 45 dollars . good sound though , look nice .  
2	  The product is a good one with the exception of one hitch . I have a 95 cavalier and the stereo wont completely fit into the spot it 's supposed to go . I dont have really any experience installing my own stereos so I was wondering if anybody has any tips .  
1	  I bought this and the larger model just in case of failure . Failures are seemingly common . It did not work . I sent it back . The other model worked . I kept it .  
2	  I bought 2 of these little video cameras at Christmas time , one 30 minute one and 1 60 minute one-1 for my niece and 1 for myself . I just love the little thing ! It is so easy to use and small enough to carry around in one 's purse or pocket . My niece , who lives in another state , and I have been emailing videos back and forth . The emails sent through Grouper are not as clear as what is originally filmed , but they are okay . Directly attaching the video to an email also works for those people ( receipient of the email w / attached file ) who have a computer and email program that will accept a large file . The video is much clearer when one does it this way . One thing I do wish that the camera had is a pause button . Once one stops filming , starting again starts a new video . While filming , it is important that the camera is held still , just like with any video camera . Slowly and smoothly is the way to film . Sure cannot beat the price for this little gem !  
1	  This is very bad . The printer does not print , I changed the ink , installed it Ok . Scanned ok . Printing and copy do not work . This is used printer  
1	  I do not know if it is the company that misrepresented or the model number or the model number my mother in law read off the video camera was incorrect , but I received this and it does not fit into the Sharp Handicam we have in our family . It was too small . Of course , once I read the VL-H880 serial number off the camcorder myself , I do believe the company maybe to blame .  
1	  RIPOFF ! This battery will not charge up all the way no matter how long I have it charging for . yes I know to deplete them every so often . yes I know about no extreme heat . Right out of the shipping box , this battery sucked ! They are selling junk . I normally like things on Amazon , but this is not one of them . Batteries are finicky , buy from a retailer , that you can take it back to , if not working . Of course there is also a no refund policy on batteries through this company . RIPOFF !  
2	  I hooked up my H4000 to a LCD projector which only has HD " component video " input , unlike other players like the Philips DVP5960 which enforce " High Definition Content Protection " ( HDCP ) rules which force HD output only on the HDMI out port , the H4000 upscaled flawlessly every DVD I wanted to play , over component video out to my NEC LCD projector . I have not tested MPEG4 , AVI or MP3 playback , as I only use legal , off-the-shelf DVDs . I recommend this player for those with LCD projectors or old HDTV sets ( made before 1996 ) which lack HDMI input ports .  
1	  There used to be a ton of negative reviews for this item , but low and behold they are all gone . I 'm going to make this short and sweet .. AVOID THIS USB FLASH DRIVE ! Like other reviews before me I didn't listen because of the cool looking rugged factor of this device . Well , the " wow " factor goes away when you get your first " USB device is not recognized " pops up on your work or home PC . Lucky for me I heeded the reviews and didn't dump 32 gigs of sensitive material on this POS ! It will work for about 2-3 months and then you will start to get the errors . You have been warned , and I would strongly suggest SanDisk or anyone else for that matter . I can't believe this company has the balls to ask the money that they are for this junk !  
2	  I bought these at Circuit City for a considerably higher price but I most say it was definetly worth the price . I don't listen to rap but I listen to everything from the Dead Milkmen to NOFX to Slipknot and everything sounds great ! Some people say that you can't hear the bass line but all you have to do is adjust the amp level and you have your bass . I would have paid alot more for these if I knew how great they sounded ! I have had these for about a year and have yet to have a problem except having to replace the battery every other week for the bass amplifier . Excellent set of headphones for the price , you can't go wrong with these ! Edit : The reason I have to replace the battery so often is because I wear these whenever I go out of the house so they get alot of use .  
1	  I bought this product because on the discription it says for ipod Nano second generation , but when i got it it was abvious that it wasn't ! .. its only made for the first generation nano , so becareful and don't waste 12 bucks like i did .  
2	  I really like this backpack . It has plenty of room to easily store everything I want to take with me , it appears to be well constructed and it is very comfortable to wear . It will easily handle a DSLR with a long lens , and has lots of compartments for additional lenses . A previous review mentioned a small waist belt , but it fit comfortably around my 36 " waist with another two inches to spare . The zippers are a bit tight , but hopefully they will loosen up a bit with use . Overall , it 's a great product for a very reasonable price .  
1	  The device is unstable , and SanDisk support is incompetent . I 've gone through the RMA process with them about 7 times now . I would have loved to give up and get a refund from Amazon after the second new unit failed to work properly , but SanDisk took so long with the first RMA that I ended up outside the 30 day return for a full refund window . I am still playing the RMA tango with them 3 and a half months later .  
1	  I 've had the Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse Blue for about 3 months now , and I have been getting very annoyed . It runs off 2 AA batteries . They only last about a month , and that seems bad , but try replacing them . If you can even manage to somehow wedge the batteries out of its compartment , you will most likely have to clean your hands off from the scrapes when trying to get it open . I recommend using a strong thin pen to pry the batteries out . Once you get them out and put new ones in , you will probably have to fidget with them for a bit to try and get the optical light back on . Another thing I have found annoying , are the glitches . Unfortunately there aren't any wireless mice out there that don't . On a lighter note , the mouse is very responsive , and although it few , minor glitches , and the fact it doesn't have the advanced web browsing buttonsthat some mice have , it operates very well , especially for its price . I , personally , would recommend a rechargable Logitech mouse . Hope this helps !  
2	  Greatest Headphones I have ever had , works great with Television , or Ipods . Highly Recommended ! Worth Your money .  
1	  I tried all the workarounds and terminal setting patches described by other reviewers . None worked for me on either an iBook or PowerBook ( yes , the internal airport cards fail and are too expensive to replace ) . I wonder why it 's so hard for Belkin to write a driver for Macs .  
2	  PowerPod Auto Charger for iPod is a simple , straightforward product - it functions exactly as expected .  
1	  The batterie of the ipod-hp 30GB gave up within the FIRST month , and I didn't even use it very frequently . The support by HP is pretty annoying - by asking 3 service people about the conditions on replacing that thing , I got 3 different answers - my recommendation : stay away from overprized ipods and if you should get one maybe take the original apple ones , but never decide to get an ipod from HP !  
1	  There is absolutely no way this product is for a s13 240sx . Ive tried cutting , sanding , molding .. Not for this car . Im not 100 percent sure but I think the Metra 99-7407 is the right din for the s13 's .  
2	  I have a flat screen TV mounted on my bedroom wall and all of the components are on the other side of the wall in the closet . After going to multiple stores and talking with lots of sales reps I still didn't have a solution for my IR problem . After reading the review of this product I decided to try it . After receiving it setup only took me about five minutes and has worked perfectly ever since . I use it with a Scientific Atlanta 8300HD box from Time Warner Cable . I would definitely recommend this product .  
2	  Works great and haven't had any problems . I did buy a comparable Kingston at the same time and don't notice a difference between the 2 .  
2	  Best SD card I have ever owned . Significantly faster then several other so called " high Speed " cards I have tried . You get 4GB of capacity for less than $ 40 . A great value !  
2	  This is a great buy for anyone at all . The sound is absolutely amazing ! I could not believe that such a big sound was coming from such a small machine ! The only downside for me , a technology lover , was the missing Audio Cable Input so that you can plug in your electronic device ( such as an iPod or a CD Player ) through its headphone jack . But still , this thing is amazing !  
1	  I read other reviews that complained about the gel product oozing out the seams . Fortunately that has not happened to me , but within a couple weeks the product permanently dented ( severely ) in the center where my wrist falls . That part of the pad is almost rock hard now . It is like using a book or other hard surface for your wrist . I would not buy this product again .  
2	  Installed it into my PCI slot . Loaded the software . It recognized all the wireless networks within range and has been working perfectly .  
2	  Just got it as a gift and already cant be without it ! I take it too the gym , the office or out running . I am a fanatic for hi-tech stuff but this is really great for anyone .  
2	  I 've been using this as a backup for both my desktop and laptop for over two years , and have had absolutely no issues with it . Am about to purchase a unit with larger capacity , and will likely purchase another Seagate . Fast , reliable , data easily retrieved . Can't comment on the quality of customer support , b / c haven't needed any to date . Waited this long to post a review to gauge how it performed over time . My previous unit , of a different brand , crapped out after just a year . I don't use this as a portable unit , as I prefer flash drives for that purpose , so can't comment along those lines either . For a stationary backup on a home network , I highly recommend it .  
1	  The power source is worthless , as is IOGear 's customer service department . It will be an utter waste of your time and money to buy this item or anything else from this company . - Lisa H.  
1	  After getting what we thought was a good Christmas deal on this printer , we have been totally disappointed to discover that , contrary to stated compatibility on the box and other documentation , it is not compatible with Mac OS X Leopard . After a call to support we discover that they are still writing software for Leopard here at the end of January and it will not be available for the foreseeable future . It is hard to believe that a company as reputable as HP would do such a horrendous job with software and misrepresent their products ' compatibility in all their documentation .  
2	  Very pleased with this order and the Quality of the merchandise , and the price was unbelievable . I would refer this to everyone .. 25ft of HDMI cable for less than $ 10 dollars you do the math Very happy with this purchase .. Thanks  
2	  This remote is quite handy . I have used it so much . My husband and I like to travel , but had a hard time getting pictures with both of us in them . Strangers rarely take a good picture . This remote along with a tiny bendable tripod allow us to get just about any shot . I even used the remote at my brother 's wedding ( with a normal tripod ) to get photos of the entire wedding party - including me . I would recommend this to anyone .  
2	  This drive seems good so far . We 're using it primarily for document storage and backup . It has a lot of storage space and I doubt we will ever fill it . Any complaints from other reviewers about noise should be ignored , it 's quieter than most desktop computers . Well , I guess I was wrong . After about 10 months of using this drive only a few times per week , it started having problems . The drive will turn itself on when the computer is hibernating and even when it is completely disconnected from the computer . I try to turn it off by holding in the power button for 5 seconds like the instructions tell you to do but it doesn't always respond and usually takes at two times doing that to turn off . Sometimes it will turn itself on again right after I shut it down and it takes several tries to get it to shut down . We 've had other problems with it as well . The computer will not always register the drive every time you plug it in even though the drive is connected and the power button indicates that it is getting power . The drive will repeatedly spin the disc at high speed and then slow down as if it is attempting to read something or function properly but it does nothing . We are lucky to get the thing to register on the computer long enough to access the data we have stored on it so I 'll be lucky if I can recover my information the next time I use it . I purchased a Seagate Freeagent external hard drive about a month ago and it seems to be a much better drive so far because everything has worked well and it doesn't make any of the noise that the My Book does .  
1	  I thought these were going to be the best heaphones , I wanted them to buy the greatest , I was dissapointed and was contempt with them . For a while until I realised they were garage and I sold themWithout the " bass " they are [ .. ] and uselessI parenthesize that word since you are not getting genuine bass . Bass should not be powered by batteries , the subwoofer is just a fake label . You really get loud vibrations picked up by drivers , hence why you need batteries . You get a ringing sensation , it will itch the first time . I think skullcandy should sell vibrators not headphones . Overall they are relaxing for a while but you realize the sound quality does not keep up with the bass . I reccomend these 70 dollars be spent elsewhere , try them out for yourself before you buy them I know tons of kids who love them , thus why I sold them . Worth 20 dollars If you ever wanna buy these , either way there 's no reason , Sony has xb500 's if you want genuine bass .  
2	  This is a great system that is easy to use and to make recordings from either CDs to MDs or radio to MD . I purchased one for myself the beginning of the year and I am now purchasing a second unit as a gift . By the way , the Amazon price is approximately $ 200 less than what I paid for this unit last year . The sound quality is very good . The only draw back is that there is not a cassette player ; but , one can be added .  
2	  The cables work and the images from my DVD player , cable box and apple TV all look great to me . I 've had one of these same exact cables for about a couple years now and all 's good . I just placed two new separate orders for these within the last week a few days apart . Got each within just a few days of ordering from SFPlanet . The first time the cables shipped the same day , and the second they shipped the following day .  
1	  Having zero problems with my Klipsch Promedias , I was heartbroken when my sub blew out and rendered my computer speakers useless after six years of faithful service ( I later found out I was lucky to get that much out of them , as there were quite a few issues with the BASH chipset ) . Doing some research online , it seemed like the current king of computer speakers was Logitech , and these Z-5500 's were the flagship of their line . I put in the order on Amazon and anxiously waited . Two days later , I was setting up the speakers , wired them all up , connected to my computer and powered them on . Unfortunately they did not turn on . No blip , bump , thud , or crackle . They simply didn't turn on . The box from UPS shown no wear or tear , and the Logitech box itself was pristine . Every single piece within the box was still wrapped , no scratches , no obvious signs of any type of shipping abuse . After looking to see if there was some sort of hidden " reset " button I had overlooked , I went to everyone 's favorite troubleshooter , Google . Google informed me that quite a few people on various forums had regularly blown the fuses of the Z-5500s and that a trip to Radio Shack might be called for . The trip was completed , and I was the brand new owner of a FUSE , 4A , SLOBLO , 5X20MM , 125V , LITTELFUSE239 . I popped in this little $ 2 fuse , and ta-da , the speakers worked like a champ . Sound-wise , honestly I was very unimpressed with my new speakers . Logitechs in general ran on the bassy side for me , and these were no different . The trebles seemed muted and blurred because of the intense focus on the bass line ( this was after tweaking both via the control pod and within Windows ) . If you were looking for just " room-shaking bass , " then this is probably a good system for you , however if you 're a music fan , you won't be overly impressed ( my music test sample was a FLAC file of Janice Ian 's Breaking Silence , and the Eagles Hell Freezes Over live songs - as well as the DTS track from the DVD ) . For those who are probably thinking that my experience was out of the ordinary , you are probably right . Most people probably have their speakers work for at least a little while after getting them out of the box . However if you do a simple search on Z-5500 and fuse , you will see that the fuse issue is not an uncommon one . Buying a 3-pack of replacement fuses will extend the life of this product but not indefinitely - so get used to knowing where your local Radio Shack or Fry 's is .  
2	  almost returned it because i thought i was ordering an 8 port modem , but it stays here because its just what my tech ( the hubby ) needed . fast shipping , working well  
1	  I bought one of these and it worked OK for about 4 months and then one of the valves stuck partially open and the excess water nearly killed the plants on the drip line I had it on . I took it apart to see if any grit had come through the filter and clogged the valve and there was none . The valve just failed . The other thing I did not like is this does not have a clock on it as such . You set the duration and time within limits . If you want it to water one time at 5 AM before the sun comes up for example you have to start it at 5 AM the first time . I also had problems with the frost bib using this timer . The valve would not open quick enough and the frost bib valve would sit there screaming while water ran partially through it so I had to remove the frost bib from the water line . I have never had to do that with any other timer I have had and I have had a few over the years . I have set up many drip lines and lawn sprinkler systems in my life and I had more problems with this timer than any . Not worth returning so I just trashed the timer after 4 months of service .  
1	  Perhaps I got a lemon , I don't know . It keeps telling me that I 'm out of black even though I 'm not . When I put a new black in , it says I 'm out of black still , then it won't let me print at all anymore . I bought just a year ago . Ink is expensive . For that one year I had it it was a good printer . I guess one has to buy a printer every year , I don't know .  
2	  I purchased this outdoor atomic clock three months ago and hung it out by our backyard pool . It is sheltered a bit by the roof overhang , but it still gets some blowing wind and rain . So far , the clock has kept perfect atomic time . The temperature indicator is a bit small , so we really can't see that feature from the pool deck , but the hands on the clock are easy to read . This clock serves our purpose perfectly . I have read reviews that say outdoor clocks like this aren't really suited for the weather , but I have no complaints , and it 's been 90 days of crazy Florida weather . We got the clock with free shipping , so the price was right , too . Great clock , great deal !  
1	  Sabrent is not the maker and do not know how it works . I Email to them ask when recorded hard disk hit full condition what happend and when camare loast video it show a dialog box do I need clcik that dialog box to make it continue or it can continue with human click on the message box . They Email back said they do not know how it works and not give the maker name .  
2	  We bought it on the advice of a friend who thought it would provide me with better sound which need because of hearing issues . For those purposes it worked great , but we did not know that when you plug it in , my wife gets no sound . So we returned it .  
2	  I bought three . All of them work fine , are very well priced and well worth the money . If you have a mac pro they fit the bill nicely making the limited in / out jack useful since as you already know it has to be pre-programed either in or out before use . These arrived as ordered and I recommend the source and the item as very useful . thanks for the great price . You made a friend .  
2	  I ordered this and a wire adapter to install an aftermarket car stereo for my 2000 CRV . While getting out the factory unit was difficult , this product made installation a breeze . It addressed the mounting issues I would have suffered had I not had this . The only reason I did not give it a five star is because the rim of plastic that goes around the face of the stereo is off a bit , and there support holes give a minor , but not noticeable gap . My wife who I installed this for could not tell the gap , but did notice the plastic rim . I would not attempt a replacement without this , or something that works like it .  
1	  Purchased cable to provide a second cable on the road . When the product plugs into a Mac product , the Mac shuts it down due to " drawing excessive power " . When I use the original cable in the same computers and CoolPix camera , no issue . A total waste .  
2	  The adaptor worked great in my trip to UK . I didn't have any problem with it . Great !  
1	  Bought in March , Wireless is now cutting in and out . Direct connections work fine-but come on-90 days before the wireless goes . I haven't tried customer support-not sure it 's worth it , last time I had a similar issue took forever for them to tell me to reset the router , update the firmware-and still had the same issues . No more D-LInk for me-I 'll be buying NetGear .  
1	  I purchased these speakers about a year ago . If you 'd like to know what your likely useable time is with these speakers feel free to use this example . I 'm on Amazon right now buying replacements ( ANOTHER BRAND ) for these that have completely failed . They worked fine at first , then got fuzzier . One quit completely tonight , no power .. nothing . The other still " works " with lots of fuzz . I find myself re-tuning the signal a lot . Time for a replacement . If you intent to use wireless speakers spend some extra bones and get a different brand . I 'm trying the Acoustic Research AW-871s now . They supposedly have better range . Don't settle for cheap unless you have to . You 'll probably be replacing them in a year if your patience lasts that long ! Don't say we didn't warn you !  
1	  I can confirm that the cartridges shipped with this photo value pack have a fraction of the ink capacity of normal cartridges . While there is nothing at all that indicates this in any of HP 's marketing materials ( bad HP ) it becomes clear when you install them . The ink level gauges on the printer show much smaller bars for these than the regular cartridges - and indeed they do run out very quickly compared to normal cartridges . Face it - HP is all about making very large profit margins from selling ink , and they aren't dumb . If you want to buy an ink combo pack of full cartridges you can search amazon for HEWLETT PACKARD 02 COMBO PACK - you will find this listed as of today at $ 60 and not that much of a discount vs . buying single cartridges .  
1	  While the dongle may work , set up is a nightmare . Anycom , a German company , has closed the US help office and there is no way to reach them except from their web site . 48 hours after first contact I still have no response . There is no documentation to speak of with the device and online documentation is spotty and does not address the operating system for which it is written sufficiently . The screen shots and processes for xp do not match the system . I have spent hours trying to find the work around . Although the dongle is advertised for 64bit systems , the CD delivered with it is not commpatible and finding the appropriate driver bit on the ANycom web site is a challenge to say the least . While the driver can be found , It does not appear that any extra software that might make setup easier is available except via the CD , which does not function . Setting up bluetooth is not intuitive and without any help or guidance , this promises to be a time consuming proposition . Until the thing is set up , no stars . When it is , one star less for each day working on it . Buy a local brand with a voice on the other line .  
1	  Hp has come out with a DVD300e version . This is an out dated version ( DVD200e ) . Its ok if you don't mind having an out dated version . Hope this helps  
1	  When I plugged this into my computer and turned it on , it caused my computer to reboot by itself every 12 minutes or so . I tried everything to find out what was causing that to happen and how to fix it to no avail . I still haven't figured out why it kept shutting down and restarting my Mac and now I 'm S.O.L. because I can't return it to Amazon without the styrofoam packing material that came inside the box ( which I threw out ) - a dumb rule . A complete waste of my money . If you have a Mac OS X , don't waste your time or money like I did !  
2	  The part came pretty quickly . I 've used it a couple of times to charge an older iPod nano and it has worked just fine . Rolls up small so it 's easy to store . Great product .  
1	  My wife and I bought this camera two years ago , before our first child was born . We 've been very happy with its performance , and found the picture quality much better than other cameras . In the last few months , however , the camera no longer accepts new rolls of APS film . Instead , it changes the cartridge from " new roll " to " exposed , " without taking any pictures . We brought this camera to the camera shop , and they told us that it was a common problem with this model , and that it would cost [ a lot ] to have it repaired . We then called Canon , and they did not admit or deny the history of this problem . They just told us that the new Z3 did not seem to have the same issues . Overall , we really like this camera . We 're probably going to try the Z3 , however , for our next camera . ..  
2	  Great notebook , very well built with nice materials , very light and with a great screen . The only thing is if you like shortcut buttons on the keyboard and close 2 it , don't buy this notebook , the keyboard is simple and clean there is no quick buttons for DVD play and sound control other then the function keyboard regular commands , so if you like just hitting 1 button to play your DVD or sliding your finger over a button to adjust sound volume , this is not for you , but , if you like clean , simple and very clean stylish looking , then buy this one . This notebook is very well built with no flaws to be noted . My overall is 5 out of 5 , but that 's because I rather have a clean working area with just the precise keyboard without a lot of buttons around it .  
1	  I bought this when I bought my new E2 . It was recommended to me by another user . I received it and was surprised that it did not latch but just assumed that was the way it was . This weekend I saw the person who had recommended it to me and I noticed that hers had a latch mechanism . I told her mine didn't and she looked at it and noticed that piece was not there . She suggested I return it since it had never worked properly although I was unaware that it didn't . I am afraid that it 's been too long . I 'm really unhappy with it now that I realize I received a defective one in the first place .  
1	  In August , my girlfriend and I purchased this 30 " . The tv since that date has dealt with the screen periodically blacking out , while the sound stays on - it also has a cut on the screen from the inside of the glass ( over . 25 " in length ) , obviously from the manufacturer . Phillips , for the past four months , first sent us to an incompetent repair center to fix the blacking out issue . Their first attempt at fixing it did not work - but since Phillips could not find another repair service in a 50 mile radius to fix the problem ( all other reps noted that Phillips will not reimburse for full travel and working time ) , they asked us to send it back to this rep - their comments were that if it was not fixable by this time , we are viable for a replacement unit . The service center attempted to fix it the second time ( incidentally , this service repair center ' lost ' our brand new flat screen tv for 2 days ) , but the problem persisted . Phillips refused to send a replacement , or issue a refund ( after over two weeks of discussion ) , and offered a new , 3rd repair center that was more competent and now services san francisco . This 3rd rep came out to preview the system , noticed the issues , and said they would return to pick up the TV unit for repair . However , in a week they called to tell me that Phillips will not support our warranty anymore , since it 's past 90 days . I contacted Phillips , spoke again to their Consumers Relations department , who noted this time that they do not issue refunds or replacements for any of their products , regardless if it is shipped faulty . They noted that the blacking out is repairable under warranty , but the Screen cut is not covered under any warranty - regardless if it comes faulty from the manufacturer , it cannot be replaced other than by our expense . They have noted that the 3rd Repair service should be calling me , as they have authorized fixing the blacked out part of the screen . This final issue alone took one month , and 6 phone calls . For 4 months I 've had to deal with Phillips - and I have been cordial , lenient , and understanding . I 've agreed to 2 repairs , the second knowing that they were poor service reps . I 've been on the phone with them over 20 times , with mixed information .. and it 's still not fixed .  
1	  I have had this drive for over a year now . At first it seemed okay , but the software that comes with it does not work well , the drive itself spends more time frozen than functioning , and the website has not been a helpful place for information . Before I realized what a problem this drive is I got one for my mom , too . She 's having the same problems . I am researching other backup drives but will not even consider getting anything from Western Digital .  
1	  I got a vector 3 years ago and was very pleased with it most of the time . The altimiter is not very useful because it is based off barometric pressure so your reading will vary wildly and you need to keep resetting it . The big flaw with this watch is that in 3 years the face has broken twice . The first time the bezel broke off . Luckly it was still under warranty and they replaced it . Now the faceplate has cracked and is letting moisture in . I don't use the watch for any crazy sports , it 's just my everyday watch so the fact that it is broken astounds me . Sunnto have a minimum $ 85 repair charge , which could go up , so at this stage I 'm bowing out with two watch failures in 3 years .  
2	  You really must try this cordless iron . I have had a cordless iron before ( a different brand ) and loved it , but it did not have as big of a water tank as this iron . I just recently purchased this iron to replace my other cordless , but I will never go back to a corded iron again ! P.S. I thought I should tell you that I do a lot of quilting so I do use my iron often ..  
1	  I was given this as a Christmas present . The idea behind it is great . I used it with my Averatec tablet . Soon after using it , the battery life dropped to about half . I purchased a tip for my phone . First time I used it , the charging was done in 10 minutes . The battery now only gets 3 days where I was getting 5 . I replaced the battery and still get the same 3 days . I 've sent emails asking about tips for other items and have not received a single response . In addition , I sent an email asking about the problems I had after using the device , again , no response . Use at your own risk .  
2	  I just got this camera a month ago and I am satisfied with it . It has a lot of features despite its size . And for point and shoot I can say it 's a great buy , comparable to other power packed cameras , it even takes better pictures sometimes . But I just had to give it a 4 because I thought I could do more with it . But you can't do much with the settings since it has it 's own default settings for certain conditions . But over all it 's a great camera . If you 're just after taking normal pictures and you want something sleek , this is definitely a good buy .  
2	  I bought this to hook my PS3 up to my LG LED LCD 42 " flat screen . Works perfect and arrived quick . Would definitely order this again if I needed another one !  
1	  My Ipod mini was given to me for my birthday in May , 2004 . Almost one month and two returns to AppleCare , I still do not have a properly functioning mini . I have heard the warnings about the problems that are typical to the mini yet I thought it wouldn't happen to me . When I first got it , it seemed to work fine , however it froze after the first ten minutes of use . My friends who also have iPods told me that this was normal . Then it happened every time I used it . AppleCare suggested that I reset the device when that happens . The problem was that I was resetting it constantly ( and losing the music in the device ) . Other problems soon followed . My unit could not recognize being charged or the music in my Itunes library . I was getting strange icons on the screen that weren't in the User 's Guide ( and only one iPod expert out of the twelve I dealt with knew what the icon meant ) . I sent it back to Apple once and they said it was fine , apparently looking for a problem unrelated to my unit . I really had to struggle with AppleCare to have them look at it again . They had me reload and update versions of software that didn't help and constantly tried to sell me expensive consumer protection plans . I spent hours on the phone with them . I guess the good people at Apple have a hard time admitting that they too are capable of making a dud , or as I now call my device , an iDud . Now I am waiting for my Ipod to come back from service again . I realize that this is an exception and there are many of you out there who I love your iPods , but if you do get a faulty unit it will be a long and difficult struggle to remedy your situation . In the end , it wasn't worth it . I now just want my device to simply work and the giver of this generous gift to feel happy that he didn't waste his money . Hopefully by my next birthday it will be functioning .  
1	  Nothing but problems , ing gobbler , the cartridge has a chip that shuts the cartridge down when its near empty .. the print head is part of the printer and when it cleans itself it uses lots of ink , this printer is going in the garbage  
1	  These radios looked and sounded good but they were anything but one of mine flat out died in two months but of coarse that is out of warenty i agree with other people about the misleading tecnecal infromation and i would perswade all other buyers to try the " Cobra " brand . HINT : with all of these different kinds buy rechargable batterys also .  
1	  I thought this was going to be ideal . I read all the reviews , and I looked through the owners manual . The problem is the the 385 ci di has the same manual as the 385 ci . It talks about using the ice transduce , and I don't see anywhere that says the di models could not use it . I was not able to get this to work , so I called humminbird and was told the ice transducer does not work on di models . I felt like I researched this as much as I could and feel ripped off . I first saw this advertised as an accessory to consider as an attatchment . I hope the is a good return policy through amazon .  
2	  Small size , easy to use , hold plenty of tunes . Comes with pretty good earphones and arm strap . I like it . No complaints .  
1	  I would have loved to have a bag which can hold a set of spare battries as well as a spare memory card . This bag is too small to hold spare battries and doesn't have any pockets .  
1	  This MP3 player is trash . The battery dies every other day . Half the time it shuts off for no reason . Can not get the voice recorder to even work . It holds the songs and it sounds great when it actually works .  
1	  I purchased this to switch monitor , keyboard and mouse between a desktop and a laptop with a docking station . It did not recognize the mouse and keyboard when hooked to docking station and worked only when connected directly to the laptop . Hence I had to returned it .  
2	  RCA 50Ft . 16 Gauge Speaker Wire . Great price for a lot of wire it became handy to hook up the Speakers to the A / V Receiver . The wire is thick and strong I like the fact that one strand is in white color on the insulation of one of the conductors so you know how to hook it up the same way at both ends , it makes it very easy , it does a good job ! The Speaker wire arrived very fast from Amazon . com with out any problems . Thank You  
2	  I have purchased and used several of these Internet cams both at home and at work . They work very well once set up , but they may require highly technical skills and knowledge to set up depending on your network environment . I like them because they have a window that shows the IP address they have picked up . This is a problem I encountered with the newer version . Without an IP address window on the device , I would have to search the network and hope the software is able to pick up the device . The software works well in very small networks , but on enterprise networks it can get confused and sometimes can not find the camera .  
2	  I use the headset with a Cisco 7960 - works great . I strongly recommend this product - excellent range and battery life . Too bad it 's not possible to pickup / hangup without connecting a headset lifter ( lame ) .  
1	  Found the camera a nice replica but much too difficult to use and the built in storage system renders the camera virtually useless for any serious picture taking . Can't recommend this little number for anything other than having a minox digital in the collection . Certainly far below any other Leica standard .  
2	  I bought this to use on Skype . I installed it using the enclosed disc . When I used it with Skype , the microphone sound worked , but I couldn't get the video to work with Skype ( " Not Skype compatible , use an updated driver " ) . I downloaded another driver from Microsoft . Still didn't work . Finally , I uninstalled the webcam , and simply plugged it in , opened Skype , and it worked just fine ! Good product for the money .  
2	  These double sided case are perfect for burning multi-disc seasons . I purchased the 100pk months ago .. and I still have more to go . I read other reviews from some not so lucky people about receiving cases damaged or broken . But I ordered anyways knowing that it doesn't happen to everyone . I got all 100 cases scratch-less ! Definitely a great buy !  
1	  This product was a replacement for one that was damaged by my maintenance guy . It got really hot when we hooked it up . I 'm pretty sure it was involved in my cable box being killed , as it stopped powering on altogether shortly after I hooked this up .  
2	  Used this to install my Infinity Basslink 200-Watt , Dual 10-Inch Powered Subwoofer System in my 2001 GMC Sierra installed over a year ago . I am not an audio guru or anything just a DIYer whenever possible . Seems to provide enough power for my setup and the cables were easily hidden . Cables may come up a little short depending on where you are mounting the hardware in your vehicle such as the trunk on SUVs and bigger cars . However , was long enough to make it under the back seat of my extended cab truck with no problem .  
1	  After purchasing 3 different PDA 's before I found one I liked , I decided that Palm series PDA 's were not worth the money . The clincher for Palm for years now has been that they have a lot more software available for their Palm operating system . This is , rather , a very ridiculous argument considering that unless you want 15 different card games or an inefficient money management program , than purchasing a Palm OS PDA is ridiculous . Palm OS PDA 's come with slower processors , the good programs must be downloaded to be used , and features like 801.11x wireless capabilities are only available in high-end models . ( Okay , some come with cameras that have worse resolution than my $ 15 web cam ) The software that is installed on them operates well , but does not have as user-friendly of a interface as MS Windows Mobile 200x ( especially sense most people are accustomed to Microsoft software already ) . It is true that MS Windows Moble 200x / Tablet PC Edition have fewer programs available , but the ones that are available are a lot more efficient and user friendly . The good programs for this operating system are already installed such as : MS Pocket Word , MS Pocket Excel , MS Messenging ( like outlook ) , File Explorer , Picture viewer , and Windows Media Player . These programs are also a WHOLE LOT easier to synchronize and use with other MS desktop applications ( for obvious reasons ) . Other cool and useful programs can be downloaded for free or a small charge like : Adobe Acrobat , Powerpoint Viewer , and AOL Instant Messenger . Bottom Line : You can buy a Pocket PC for around $ 250 or so that often has wireless , a digital voice recorder , and an INCREDIBLY easier sync system with other MS applications . If you like paying the same for a crappy 320x320 camera and having to settle for programs that often have to be downloaded or purchased to sync with basic MS products ( if you can figure out how to download them at all ) and have no wireless capability then PalmOne is for you . Otherwise BUY POCKET PC !  
1	  I concur with F. Littlefield 's review of August 28 , 2004 . This is the biggest piece of junk I ever owned . In fact , I just yanked it out , beat it to a pulp ( After removing my new DVD of " The Italian Job , " and threw it away . Half the time , it takes 10-12 tries to get a DVD to " load , " meaning you have to open , close , wait ; open , close , wait .. There are also frequent skips and freeze-ups during playback . Apparently , it does not handle dual layer discs well at all . You get what you pay for . If you want headaches , buy this . If you want to watch DVD 's spend another hundred dollars for a player that works ! Another drawback : Apex apparently uses proprietary remote control codes , meaning you cannot program your cable or satellite remote 's AUX function for the DVD .  
1	  Audio has loud low frequency hum that overpowers your voice on recordings . I installed the unit on 2 different PC 's , tried it with XP , Vista and Windows 7 . Same result on all . The video works , but the audio is completely worthless . Guess I got what I paid for .  
1	  Amazon recommended this cable for Onkyo CS-445 CD Receiver System and PSW10 Polk subwoofer .. wrong cable ! needs to be a single on receiver side and a right and left input on the subwoofer side .. This cable is single on both ends ..  
1	  I purchased the DVD player 10/09/2001 and have had problems ever since . The unit would play a DVD Vidio for about 30 to 45 minutes and stop with the image frozen on the screen , nothing could be done to correct the problem . The unit was in for repairs from 11/01/2001 until 11/27/2001 , with the PC board assembly and pick up mechanism replaced . It worked OK for three months , and now the same problem is happening again .  
2	  I 've had this tv for over a month now and have not run into any real problems . I did experience the low buzzing noise that others noticed , but after a couple of days it stopped completely ( or maybe I stopped noticing ) . It is my first flat screen , so I have nothing else to compare it to , but in my opinion , for the [ $ ] bucks it is more than satisfactory . It 's volume is not the greatest even at its highest , but I was never planning on busting my ear drums or the little tv speakers anyway . I 'll probably hook some speakers to it . The picture is of good quality , I think , and my video games come out pretty nice . All in all , a good buy .  
2	  This MD player isn't perfect . But it 's close . The duration one must hold the fastforward / rewind button in order to rewind was a bit unnerving at first , but I 've quickly become used to it . And it definitely took a chunk out of my wallet , but it was worth it . This model is so small that it seems like my pockets are drastically too large for just this device . The size is great - it is the perfect size for the hand : smaller would be too small , bigger would begin to be bulky . Of course , having the different variations of recording options is very nice , too . For MP3s , I can record over 5 hours on LP4 mode and have a huge mix that will last a trip to Irvine and back . I record my CDs on LP2 mode without any audible loss of quality , sometimes having up to 6 albums on one disc . A couple classical numbers I 've recorded on Stereo mode , to preserve every note , as classical music is a bit more fragile than rock and roll . And the best yet ! I can easily record all my vinyl albums to MD and have easily accessible and transportible digital copies , edited and divided into tracks without breaking a sweat . And who can forget the tremendous battery life ? By using the AC adaptor when I 'm at home and recharging the battery once it gets low ( just hit one button , no extra bulky charger ) - I have not drained even one battery in the innumerable hours I 've spent listening to music with this . No longer will I be annoyed when jarring motion causes my audio pleasure to halt . No longer will I be plagued by the demons that cause scratches on CDs . No longer will I have to carry a pocket full of spare batteries . No longer will I have anything in my wallet - well , not for a while , at least , but I 'll tell you - it was definitely worth it .  
1	  1 . If you have tons of cataloged pictures in the 3:2 aspect and don't want to start collecting 16:9's2 . And you are looking for a small P & S ; with full control AND WIDE LENSread this camera 's test in the November popular photography and you will realize that this camera is only 28mm in the 16:9 aspectIf you collect 3:2 's you will be buying something like 33mm in the wide end  
1	  No manual or instructions are included . The light is broken on mine . I called and emailed customer service . They don't reply . Don't buy unless you want to get stuck with expensive junk .  
1	  I 'll type this with what CPU time SonicStage allows . I was concerned in " going digital " that I 'd spend too much time in overhead - managing which tracks to get , which to put on the player . Still I tended ( or chose ) to discount the many complaints about the software over the niftiness of the player . 700 tracks over 250 for a 1-gig Ipod with a radio and long battery life thrown in . Indeed the ATRAC format sounds fine and its the best mini radio I 've used . That 's the 1-star . Unfortunately , the software is as much the product as the gadget itself . It 's all the forementioned and more ( when I got it to run - it requires XP service pack 2 which Indian support never told me ) . Its maddeningly slow - bringing the whole system to a grinding halt where other windows can take a minute or two to respond when its loading the player . ( Don't think about doing anything else to SonicStage . ) It has no end of idiosynchrosies - the why did it do thats and why can't I do this 's never stop . I 've wasted many evenings in the last 6 weeks trying to load it - learning just how to select the tracks so they 'll end up in the right album folder and not in another , or dumped in folders called " new album " or " untitled " . The tracklist for the player won't sort and can't be printed . Who knows if everything 's there . Sonicstage will arbitrarily refuse to load tracks to the player with cryptic error messages ( aplenty ) . Reimport the tracks to Sonicstage and its got no problem . And a few corrupted ( screech ) files have showed up that worked before . Anyway what compelled the post was the other night when newly loaded tracks were again going to the wrong folder . There being no way to stop the transfer and in what wasn't the first white rage I killed SonicStage from the task manager . When it restarted it didn't recognise the player and said I would need to delete all files please to thank you . 800 Meg . Now this is the equivalent of " Windows was improperly shut down - please reformat your hard drive " . An overnight reload has it halfway back but I sure wish it said something about backups . Again taken as software / hardware , this a consumer product that makes the Yugo look good . There are plenty of choices . I urge you to keep looking .  
2	  very good and very clear sound .  
1	  LISTEN ! DONT EVER EVER BUY THESE.I dont care how cheap SONY offers them for - i have bought 2 pairs of these to wear while at work - and in both instances , used or new - the headphones send shocks into your ear lobes randomly . these are VERY DANGEROUS . SONY has refused to respond to my complaints for them . Do Not . Buy .  
2	  I purchased this unit two years ago after reading all reviews ( positive and negative ) . This is a great unit and I strongly recommend it BUT the case is not waterproof . To solve this , I mounted the unit on a 2 " x2 " 5 ' wood stake ( available at any hardware store ) and I mounted a plastic dome on top of the stake ( 16 " Clear Squirrel Baffle available at amazon ) to keep it dry . If you are not a do-it-yourselfer , get a friend who is to help you . Battery lasts 6 months or more . Also got the PR-3000 wireless receiver which works great too . Note : The stake and cover must not be made of metal .  
1	  The sound quality on this is terrible . I have an old Sony cassette adapter that is almost 20 years old and it sounds great . I got this for my wife 's car and it 's terrible . I ordered the Phillips one instead and it sounds fine . I would return it , but it 's probably not worth the postage . Don't waste your money on this one .  
1	  I had my unit for a year and the plastic hinge broke . I recommend getting and using the optional leather carrying case at all times because it helps protect the hinge somewhat . My hinge broke after a day I was carrying around my gps unit but didn't have my leather case with me . However I think the hinge started getting more loose after about 9 months of use because the flip cover started falling off my pda occaisionaly after about 9 months of use . Even when using the leather case you 'll still want to use the flip cover . The leather case is softer and if you don't have the flip cover on inside the case there a good chace your unit 's on button will get pressed on inside your pocket and the pda battery will get drained . The flip case is more rigid and it helps prevent the on button from accidently getting turned on while you are carring the pda inside the leather case .  
2	  I bought a 30GB Ipod recently . Sound quality and lot other features are great . But the battery life is so poor . Seems like a Apple has the same problem with other models too . My two daughters own Ipod Nanos . Those also have the same poor life issue . Hope Apple will come up with better battery life solution with the next generation of Ipods .  
2	  This was precisely what I wanted ! It holds a CD player , CDs in sleeves , and has a built in speaker . Quite good sound , and all well protected in a hard case . I took this with me for a year in Chad : a very hot , dry , and sandy country . The case protected the speaker , player , and discs perfectly , it sounded great , and it held up well in the elements .  
1	  Stay away from this product as the hinge is of poor design and when it fails will crack the plastic housing the screen . Polaroid will not stand behind this product or repair it when out of warranty . They will offer you a replacement for $ 150.00 with the same results . Stay away and find something else !  
1	  When I reccived this mine did not work ? I never returned it only because it wasnt that much money and I dont feel like going threw the hasslle I might have just got a dud one or it broke in delivery or something idk but the red light comes on but it docent charge my phone ipad ipod nothing so im positive that its broken and not my device or my car because everything is new and I have had no problems with anything else before so it HAS to be this product .  
1	  thrilled with this machine - wonderful for $ 225 .. never a blip , good features , picture , and sound on both dvd and vhs . but , much to my dismay , three weeks past its first birthday , it began to power off all by itself . my local repair shop offered to fix it for $ 180 . what a piece of junk . i 'll go with samsung from now on . junk !  
2	  This is my first apple product in 10 years and it is truly a work of wonder , beautifully designed and works perfectly , no one should be without one . I got it yesterday and I am all smiles today , imagine having your whole CD collection in this tiny device . Be warned that the PC version does not automatically sync up when you connect to the USB port , you have to click on the Sync button in musicmatch .  
2	  I purchased this Velocity cable to patch my Dish Network receiver to a SDTV card in my computer . The picture is excellent and so is the sound . Perfect cable for the job , I watch TV in a window on the PC monitor while using the computer .  
1	  I have been using this gps for the last three days and so far I have been very satisfied with its performance . I have been looking for a gps for a while now but the expensive prices has kept me from buying one I saw this gps in the ads and did some research on it and found out that a lot of buyers were satisfied with it the same way as in other expensive models . I ordered the gps online and downloaded the maps and had it running in about an hour it is simple enough to use and gets the job done , the size of it 's screen although small is just perfect because it doesn't distract you too much as compared with other brands that might give you more of a blind spots while driving . The sound volume of this gps is good and loud enough for me , actually I set it up on vol 4 only because vol 5 was too loud for me so even if youre listening to the radio while driving the sound of the gps is more than adequate . This gps has a setting which makes you choose between quickest route or shortest route so customize what type of navigation you want I guess if youre just driving locally you could opt for the shorter route and discover some back roads that you never knew about and for longer trips wherein you 'll go to major roads just set it for quickest route . Overall I am very satisfied with this product it doesn't have all the bells and whistles as in other higher end models but it gets the job done without breaking the bank . As far as I 'm concerned this little gadget is a 4 star !  
2	  I just recieved the unit today . I have found that it will meet all my needs for a picture frame . I have not used all the features however I am writing this to warn buyers to be careful of paying over the msrp on this unit and the sv 811 , many dealers are charging way over the asking price from Kodak . Check the Kodak site for the fair price . A fair price is around $ 169.00 some are asking around $ 199.00 - 225.00the only problem I recognized right away is that the stand is not going to support the unit . I fixed the problem by going to walmarts and purchasing a picture frame stand , problem solved . update as of Jan 26th'Check the price at Kodak store they are going for 199.99 and I think this is high for the unit . I paid 166.99 at Amazon just about a mounth ago they will go down . Word to the wise  
2	  My hubby always finds the best . So he did . We are happy with this charger . We just leave batteries there overnight and in the morning they are good to go . Very easy to use . The only thing is that batteries don't really last long , but that 's another story .  
1	  Although almost everybody says the good words , I should point out several things which make me very unhappy : 1 ) Hard to set up due to the poor documentations . If you have something wrong with the installation , that is really a pain . 2 ) The left and right mouse buttons are cramed together . I don't know why logigech came up with this design . This is an exception compared with other logitech mice . 3 ) There are no cap and num lock lights on the keyboard . When you boot up the machine and enter the password , got to lose some time . Anyway , I probable go for the Microsoft intelli mouse and keyborad combination .  
2	  I bought this keyboard and mouse set up for one reason , the multi media controlls , and the fact that it was wireless . I planned to use it as a remote for my computer , which is attachecd to my sound system . before this I had no way to change tracks in winamp from across the room . So i went out and dropped 90 bucks when it first came out .. to use it as a remote . once i set it all up , including the buttons , it made my day to day cyber life much easier . By far i got a ton more than i expected . I would buy it again , and after like 4 days , my roommate , who laughed at me for spending so much , bought one too . Get the keyboard , and bask in the freedom it provides .  
2	  Too many splitters were degrading my cable signal . This booster installed without a hitch , and my television and digital phone clarity increased immediately . However , my cable modem was unable to start / maintain a live Internet connection , even when connected directly to the booster . To fix this , I connected the modem to yet another coax splitter to cut the boost back down . Now things are working great . * because it did the polar opposite of what it promised for my cable Internet signal .  
1	  The rubber came off pretty quickly ( just like for the original release platform this one replaced ) . I can't recommend this .  
1	  I guess I got fooled too . I was expecting a set of five cables based on the picture . $ 17 with shipping for one cable seems a wee bit overpriced .  
2	  Well , it has a variety of screwdrivers and other tools useful for working on your computer . In my case , I was disassembling a laptop , so some of the tools cannot be used because only desktop computers require them . But I can see how if I 'm assembling a desktop computer , they would come in handy . The only complaint I have is that since I was working on a laptop , some of the screws are too small to be used by even the smallest screwdriver in this set . That can be easily remedied by a $ 2 eyeglass repair kit from a local drug store , though . I really liked the yellow tool that allows you to pull small screwdrivers out of their sockets when unscrewed . I was looking at the other kit with a soldering iron , but decided that I 'd rather buy a higher quality soldering iron separately , so I went with this one . Can't imagine most people to have any problems with this set , except when working on laptops .  
2	  This is a very good camera for the money . Great image , very easy set-up , very compatible with all online messenger services . Logitech just needs to work a little more on the white balance , and this cam would be the best .  
2	  I bought this to replace my failing manual switch here . Nyrius SW100 Digital Audio Optical Toslink 3 Input Selector Switch Compatible with Fiber Optic Cables , HDTV , Blu-ray DVD player , PCM , Dolby Digital , DTS , XBOX360 , PS3 . I was using it to connect my PS3 , 360 , Direct TV , and my laptop to my Turtle Beach MW3 Delta headset 's receiver . I had the PS3 , and 360 optical cables ran straight to the switch . And then my laptop and Direct TV box are attached to the TV , and then those 2 ran to the switch via the TV 's optical audio out . It lasted about a year working fine , but over the last few months the connections have gotten a little loose . And every once in awhile I have to jiggle them to get then to work again . But I definitely got my $ 20 worth from the Nyrius . Anyway when the manual one started going out I started looking for options . At first the only one I could find was this one here . 4x2 Remote Control Digital Optical TOSlink Audio Fiber Optic Selector Switch Switcher Splitter . But I just didn't want to spend that much , so I considered buying another Nyrius . But after doing a little more research I found the Cables to Go models 28731 , and 40324 and since I only needed it for the optical ports and didn't need the component option of the 40324 I decided on the 28731 . I got lucky and found a used " like new , and only used once " 28731 for under $ 30 . So that was a no-brainer considering that it was only $ 10 more than just buying another manual one . Well I just got it today , and it is definitely like new . Its in perfect condition . Setting up was super easy . I had originally planned on putting it into the side of my TV stand and out of view , but the remote would not work at all like that . And that would be my only complaint about this so far . The remote has to be pretty much aimed straight at it to work . So I installed it directly under my TV , and sitting on the TV 's pedestal . ( I attached some pics to the product page ) . I routed all my wires , and then used some double sided tape to attach the remote to the side of my dresser right next to where I sit when I watch TV . It works perfect . No more getting up and switching the switch to change audio inputs , and no risk of losing the small remote . ( Pics of this too ) . Ive tested it now on all 3 inputs and they all work great . No sound loss that I notice . It makes me wish I would have bought one of these a long time ago , but better late then never . I will update this review if anything changes . But as of right now Im a happy camper !  
1	  I was very happy with the product initially , but then came home from vacation to find the connection had dropped . No internet connection was possible when the router was installed . Perhaps it was due to a nearby lightning strike , but nothing else in our house had problems . In any case , the direct port use for our desktop stopped working altogether . I tried other ports but the unit was unable to get an IP . The manual is no help . Time for the trash , then off to the store for some other brand .  
1	  The black cartridge did not print evenly . My printer wouldn't read the color cartridge . I have used refurbished or refilled ink before but I have never had this problem . I would not recommend purchasing these .  
2	  That 's what my computer is doing now , thanks to this RAM . I was weary of buying it at first because I had never heard of the brand , but so far so good . Nothing has broken . Now , I just need a new sound card ( bleh ) .  
2	  I picked this annenia up for my daughter . It is paired up with a RCA 32 " LCD TV . In the cities ( Twin Cities ) it picked every station and there sub-stations . Good clear picture and sound . But , when she got back to the University she attends ( out a ways from the cities ) it would not pick up any stations . So , it would seem it is a good short range annenia but not good past 10 to 20 miles .  
2	  Thank you . Disc work good have no problem . I wish I had order more then what I did but what can I say but thank you again  
1	  poor image quality . cant see anything unless it is daylight , or you have ten lights on . its stand is akward and doesnt really fit on anything , and the cord is a little too short .  
2	  Perks up quickly . Coffee tastes fantastic . Product has been used now for about two years and still going strong . Might buy a second one as a backup .  
1	  I Purchased this product on 05/15/2008 the screen was messed up it played for a little while and went out . I had it replaced and the same thing happend with the new one i was sent . these are cheap and don't work do not purchase it . With the second one i asked for a refund from amazon and still didnt get it this was about 3 weeks ago .  
2	  I received this product from Infinite-Surplus . com ( via Amazaon . com ) on time and in good condition , and at a cheaper price than Staples , so I was pleased with my purchase .  
2	  I got this 3D mouse specifically to use with Autodesk Inventor and Solidworks and it works great with both of them . Not only that , now that I 'm used to navigating with it - I struggle whenever I don't have it , it is 100 % more intuitive than the native navigation you have to battle with your 2D mouse . For anybody doing much 3D CAD work , you gotta get one ! I 'm impressed with the quality look and feel of the unit and how well it stays put even when you pull vertically up on it . It took me about 10 minutes to get the drivers installed and the " feel " configured to my liking in both apps . Highly recommend this unit !  
1	  I bought this CD player when looking for a way to play radio programs I burn to a CD as MP3 's . It would be perfect for that , but for some strange reason , the first one of these I bought began losing power . It would just shut off for no reason , and it was definitely some kind of power loss because I had to reset the volume and navigate back to the track after hitting Play again . I contacted customer support and I would have to send the unit in for diagnosis . There are costs involved in all that and I figured that since the price I originally paid for this model ( $ 99 ) had dropped to $ 59 , I might as well just replace it . So I bought a new one of the same model and the power fails on it , too ! This is with fresh batteries or even with a power adapter . I cannot figure it out . I even replaced the cassette adapter I use in my car and the power still dies . When you 're listening to a talk MP3 that 's 40 minutes long , having the power fail at 36 minutes is very annoying because the fast-forward function doesn't work well at all . You have to hold down the fast-forward for about 20 seconds just to advance one minute . A time skip feature would be more useful . Hit the Skip button and jump ahead one minute . Hold it down and jump ahead three minutes per second . I 've decided to return the D-NE510 and I 'm going to pay more for the NE710 model . If that oen also fails , I 'm going to abandon the Sony brand altogether .  
2	  When I found this product to be just what the doctor ordered for allowing clients on my LAN to access the internet through a single cable modem . The physical set-up took about five minutes and the initial software set-up took about ten minutes . Had I not needed Laplink access to one of the computers on the LAN , the default settings would have been sufficient . Changing the settings is easy , through a browser window , to which access can be limited through customizable passwords . A basic understanding of networking principals is helpful but the onscreen help answered all of my questions . I didn't need any telephone or email tech support , so I can't comment on the quality of Linksys ' tech support . In full firewall mode the computers on the LAN are virtually invisable to outsiders , yet fully available to the other LAN clients ( according to your Windows sharing settings ) . You can also allow one or more computers on the LAN to open ports to the internet by using Linksys ' " DMZ " function , and the administrator can easily monitor the connections to ensure that clients are getting access . I gave up on the software solutions , such as Microsoft 's Internet Connection Sharing . They were too finicky and conflicted with the cable arrangement at my office building . With the Linksys Router there is no need to configure a second ethernet card in the connected computer or set the client TCP / IP numbers , unless you want to . The Router acts as the WAN connected computer and provides the router backbone for four direct connected clients . Additional clients can be added by connecting additional switches or hubs to the router , for up to over 200 clients . I didn't do a lot of comparison testing , but I read quite a few reviews and the reviews seem to be true , the Linksys product is easy and quick and probably the best for the money . A great deal at a super price .  
2	  Hey ! They are comfortable and work good . I really like it . I think it 's a good deal for $ 15 ! Sound quality is cool . I would definitely recomend it .  
1	  I read some other review on here that must 've been written by someone who works for " Griffin " cause they say they got it for their ipod touch and love it ? ! .. This is BS it will transmit from the ipod touch to your radio but , a warning message pops up saying it won't charge it . be forewarned !  
2	  Though a little big for point and shot cameras of 2010-2011 . but the quality of this product is really nice . I am carrying sony cybershot wx-9 , its charger , usb cable and extra memory card in this case and still a little space is left .  
1	  I purchased this item 2 months ago , tried it with windows 7 using Vista drivers from their website .. couldn't make it work . Emailed support to see if there will be Windows 7 drivers .. answer : not sure , if we do we will let you know . Hooked up to a XP machine , works ok if the ambient lighting is ok , not so good in low light , don't know what the LED 's do , never light up white as some people claim and appear to have no IR effect , picture black when I darken room . Does appear to see IR from a remote , in a dark room I can turn on a IR remote and see the glow albeit very weak . Nice Clamp ..  
2	  I bought this TV about 3 months ago . I waited to write a review after putting it through a fairly extensive test period . This TV is nothing less than outstanding . The picture is gorgeous . The set looks humongous since it replaced a 26 inch LCD . It is a little heavier than I 'd prefer , but having a swivel base surely helps . The default picture setting is set to " sports " , which has a very bright and unnatural color scheme . After playing with the regular setting choices , I found the " document " setting to be the best for my eyes . This set has many input choices , and I like the fact that it has a set of AV inputs on the side . This is very useful if you mount the TV to a wall , or it 's hard to get to the back for any reason . Hooked up to my standard cable connection , it picks up all the unscrambled digital channels . This means I am able to watch my local broadcast channels in their full HD glory ! Our XBox 360 is connected through HDMI , and games as well as movies are truly breathtaking . Because of the size of this TV , I came to realize that not all DVDs are made equal . The difference between poor quality DVDs and the " near HD " quality ones is suddenly quite obvious . I 'm still going to wait to get a blueray ( or whatever the next HD standard ) disk player when they cost less than $ 100 . Until then , I 'll be very discriminating when purchasing DVDs . I like the power saving feature in this TV , even though some reviewers find it annoying . It causes the TV to take a few seconds before it powers up . This delay also allows for the other AV components to turn on and get ready for the party . ;-) If I have to pick something to complain about it would be the remote . Sure it has all the functions , etc , but it performs poorly . I find myself having to press a button several times to get it to register . Perhaps it 's a problem with the batteries . Nevertheless , I am using a Harmony 880 remote instead , and it works fantastic . No problem . I hope this TV is good for many years of moderate use . Time will tell . For now , I am a very happy camper ( now bordering into couch potato territory ) .  
2	  Netgear was not working for my MAC , but the linksys serves both my computer and my roomie 's PC .  
2	  Correct Price , precise description . Perfect delivery timing . It 's perfect for a beginner and even for a student photographer . Recommended . Targus is a serious brand .  
1	  In an almost identical manner to another reviewer , 6 months after purchase the color went out on all inputs except the hdtv . Customer service ( people in India pretending to be in the US by giving you an American name ) were totally clueless . After several calls , they refer me to a local authorized repair center . Since it was out of warranty for labor , that meant $ 200 for me . The part , cost $ 700 but was covered under warranty . $ 65 so that I didn't have to haul the set to the repar place . It has taken 3 service visits and 1 month and the set isn't fixed yet . Adecent ( not great ) set when its working , but this experience will keep me from buying another Philips / Magnavox product again .  
1	  I found this in a discount store in NYC and since it was cheap so I bought it . After a day I returned it and got a good refund , because if I had it longer I 'd have thrown it out of the window or burned it on my stove . ( Background : for those not in the know , Coby is a small Korean company that peddles low-quality electronics . They are known for low cost and , surprise ! , low quality . ) The DVD recorder was supposed to let you burn video source materials onto DVD blanks , but as much as I tried I couldn't get it to work . About 30 seconds after I pressed Record it would give this vibrating noise and then eventually I had to unplug it . The exterior of the recorder also does not inspire confidence at all : one of the buttons on the front didn't quite work . Seriously , save yourself the money and buy something that works , like the popular Panasonic DMR-E55S or DMR-E55K . The Coby isn't worth the frustrations even if it were given away for free .  
2	  I was lookin for a hard disk camcorder from more that a year . I saw the JVC one but they are not on the level of the sony camcorder . it is excellent . I will give it a five stars .  
1	  While this product makes big promises ; it doesn't deliver . It sometimes worked with my Scientific Atlanta DVR remote but most times it would pick up an errant signal and continually scroll through the menus . Note that I live in a duplex studio apartment so no walls and not a long distance to transmit .  
1	  This product DIDNOT work at all with the ipod shuffles I have . There is a small ' tab ' ( not sure what to call it ) that prohibits the shuffle from connecting all the way down . But even after taking a razor blade and cutting off the extra plastic that was in the way , the shuffle STILL wouldn't work with this ! If I held the shuffle down snug with my finger I could get music to play , but as soon as I lifted my finger it would pop up and wouldn't play . So I guess I would say to make absolutely sure this will work with your EXACT ipod Shuffle ' Generation ' before buying it .  
1	  I bought this item on Amazon , but through Infinite Surplus . This is meant to be a helpful warning to Amazon Shoppers . I bought this cartridge last year . It sat on a shelf in my office until I needed it . After removing the shipping label ( which was stuck over the end of the box thus concealing the fact that the box had been previously opened ) , I realized that the box had been opened , but not the inside plastic buble wrap that held the toner cartridge . Infinite Surplus sold me an open box ! After opening the bubble wrap , I noticed a broken tab on the cartridge that rendered the cartridge inoperable . I assume that the toner cartridge I bought had been opened and dropped at some point before I bought it . I will likely try to superglue the broken tab to see if I can make it work . I am way beyond the return period for this item . Before you start complaining about this being the wrong place for a review of this nature , I did look for a place to leave seller feedback and could not find one . If you have helpful suggestions about where I can leave a comment like this , please send it along . Otherwise , I would take my hard learned lesson and make sure you check packaging when you receive the item even if a portion of the package is concealed by shipping lebels , etc . I have emailed Infinite Surplus and Amazon . I will update this review once I get a response . This is the first problem I 've ever had with an item bought on Amazon . * Update * Amazon responded Infinite Surplus never did .  
2	  I purchased this to use in my old entertainment center to lift up a 26 " flat panel TV because I was unable to rearrange the center 's one shelf to raise the TV set . I chose this stand because it said it would accommodate a wide monitor , the specifications said it would accommodate the weight of the TV , and the legs came in sections so that I could adjust the height . I also have some space under the stand where I can store the remotes and some DVD 's . This worked well for me .  
2	  Gone are the days of the cheesy little novelty item digicam , with its whopping 640 * 480 resolution , ASA 60 equivalence and lens that does not compare favorably to a Koday Funsaver disposable . This is the real thing . A digital camera to satisfy photography enthusiasts . This camera produces remarkable results at high resolutions . It emulates ASA 100 , 200 , 400 and 800 . Has white-balance settings to satisfy most conditions , allows you to set your own if you want more accuracy . Goes a reasonable distance on both sides of 50mm , at selectable F-stops in the F3-F10 range . Aperature-priority , shutter-priority , programmable auto and full manual settings let you take control of what you want . Two complaints : the included 16mb card is a bit small for my tastes , but prices on those are falling . ( Amazon has a Viking 128mb card at [ a good price ] And the shutter timer only works in macro focus mode and deselects itself after you use it , which can get annoying if you are taking a series of tripod shots . But this is all minor , and does not change the fact that this is the only digital I 've found that has made me hang up my Minolta SLR .  
1	  I purchased the DUB-H7 from a local electronics store and found that it installed easily and rapidly on my Gateway laptop running Windows 7 . I was also able to load all 7 slots ( 5 USB memory sticks and 2 external notebook hard drives ) successfully . It recognized and powered them all with no problem , so I have a hard time believing that the local power supply is powering only the LEDs and not the USB ports themselves . My computer showed all of the devices attached and I could see and load files from each of them . I did , however , have a serious problem and that is the reason for the title of this post . When I first connected the hub to my laptop I followed the D-Link instructions by first applying power to the hub and then connecting it to a USB port on my computer . It immediately recognized it and installed it . I then loaded up the ports with memory devices while verifying that they showed up on the Windows Explorer list . This worked all the way up to the full complement of 7 devices as stated above . With the computer still on I turned off power to the hub and after a few seconds reapplied power via the power strip switch . Everything came back up OK except that the two external hard drives were not recognized . By unplugging and replugging their USB connectors each of them was successfully recognized . After that I powered down all the USB connected devices via the power strip OFF switch and powered the computer down in the normal way . Everything was off overnight . The next morning I first powered up all the USB devices and then booted the computer . This meant that the computer was booting into an already powered hub . The computer entered its BIOS POST but never completed it . I got a completely blank screen except for a " DOS " type cursor in the upper left corner . Several hours of recovery efforts have been unsuccessful , including reloading all the BIOS defaults . It looks very much like something on the motherboard was wiped out by the 5-volt feedback from the hub as the computer was booting up . Thus I am posting this Caution in the interest of possibly helping someone else avoid the same fate . At this point I don't know if the cause of the anomaly lies with the hub or the computer . That is why I downrated the device to 4 . There was no warning in the instructions about making sure the computer was booted up before powering the hub . My computer is brand new and looks like it will have to be sent back to the factory for repair so I would advise others not to boot into a powered hub . Addendum 1/15/2012 : ( Note : Rating changed from 4 stars to 1 star ) After the above post I took my laptop back to where I bought it and , after troubleshooting , they replaced the motherboard . Fortunately it was still under warranty . After that I was very careful about how I used the DUB-H7 , but still experienced the situation described above again and that also resulted in replacing the motherboard . So this device has been implicated in killing two motherboards . After that I discontinued using it . I still don't know for sure whether to blame the computer or the DUB-H7 , but I would recommend others NOT buying this device . A better choice would be a USB extender that uses a fiber optic connection . That way there is no possibility of the extender presenting an excessive electrical load to the computer . Incidentally , I subsequently tried a " TruLink Wireless USB Extender ( 29578/29576 ) " and that didn't work reliably either with Windows 7 . LifeWorks Technology Group told me they have no plans to rewrite the firmware to be compatible with W7 . For the last year and a half I have just worked around not having extended USB capability .  
1	  I bought this as a xmas present for my 75 year old dad . He couldn't figure it out , my husband couldn't figure it out , and my 24 year old son couldn't figure it out . How can it be so hard to hook this thing up !  
2	  This book was a quick , enjoyable read . Nothing groundbreaking , but the simple , proven advice Bill Rancic offered was still valuable . As someone trying to make a start on my own with a small business I particularly enjoyed the stories about Bill 's small businesses . Selling cars for a profit while in high school is really quite brilliant . As was the boat waxing company . Clearly , Bill has a gift for building businesses and creating multiple streams of income . If you haven't read a lot of business / entrepreneurial types of books yet , or if you 're just a fan of the show , you won't be disappointed with this book .  
2	  First let me just say , this is NOT a pro camcorder ! WIth that said , this is one of the best investments I made for making memories . I had HDR-HC1 for about a year and used it moderately , and have been very happy with the results . Pros : 1 . Great picture . 2 . Very light . Your arm will not get tired . 3 . Easy to use . Just put tape in and you are ready . 4 . Easy to connect to MacBook . Plug and play . Cons . 1 . Needs more zoom . 2 . Build in mic not too great . 3 . Short battery life . 4 . Small view angle . There are some drop outs on the video , but i think that is because I use " the " cheapest tapes I can find . Even so , I only noticed one drop in 12-14 tapes . Good luck .  
1	  I got this GPS after reading the good reviews on Amazon . However , so far the unit has proven to be a big disappointment . For me , the biggest problem with this GPS is that it doesn't give the best directions for getting to destinations . I 've tested it on a few places that I knew how to get to , and about 50 % of the time it told me to take routes that are simply out of the way ( some are so obviously wrong , leaving me wonder how in the world they came up with the direction ) . Sometimes it would announce that I 've arrived at the destination when I haven't yet reached the building . I live in a well populated area that has been developed for quite some time , so there is no excuse for the incorrect information . Because of the wrong directions I 've got so far on places that I 'm familiar with , I don't feel like I can trust this GPS to take me to a place that I haven't been to before . Before I leave for a new destination , I still have to get the directions from Yahoo or Mapquest to use in conjunction with the GPS , so I can make sure that this little gadget doesn't take me on a wrong or longer route . Other things that annoy me are the voice prompt ( it says to " keep left " on the freeways and streets when it simply means not to be in the right lane , and the repeating prompts sound " nagging " after a while ) and the lack of the text to speech feature . The trip planning feature also isn't very user friendly . Overall , I 'm not satisfied with this GPS .  
2	  I needed a basic wireless router while away from home . My room had DSL but in an inconvenient location . I found the D-Link DIR-615 in a Navy Exchange ( at $ 20 more than Amazon ) and bought it because I couldn't wait for shipping . It was very easy to set up with the CD wizard and I was completed in just a very few minutes . I had to call tech support right away because I could not connect with the router and there was one option in my wireless setup that needed to be unchecked , but since that , it has performed flawlessly . And , support was easy to reach and friendly . So far I have nothing but praise for this unit and essentially agree with the CNET review of this item . It is small and lightweight enough to fit in my backpack along with my notebook PC and will be with me on all future travels . I am very satisfied with my purchase and despite being overpriced where I bought it , is still very reasonably-priced for a quality N router .  
2	  First instruction for CRV , break all tabs in the main frame . Are you kidding me ? If I break that flimsy frame in the process , have to wait 7days for a spare to arrive ! Used a nose-player to break all the tabs and it fit very nicely to the car . Plastic quality matches great with dashboard . The small plastic pocket works as a holder for the remote and occasionally for my hard drive with all songs I ever had ! Will definitely recommend to others ..  
2	  The radio works just fine . It is for my kitchen . On some cds it has a high pitch ring squeal .  
2	  The Corsair 16GB Flash Voyager in this reviewer 's opinion is all that you 'd need in a memory USB storage media device . Mine works exceptionally well and handles data transfer faster than I had thought it would . The rubberized casing is very sturdy . My only negative comment is the size .  
2	  I have purchased and used a wide variety of keyboards that I have either worn out or they just were not right for me . I thought the Logitech Wireless Illuminated K800 was one of the best until it began to go crazy with inserting random letters while typing reviews and documents in Word . When I read the reviews on the Saitek Eclipse II ( I am not a gamer ) I decided to try it out . What a keyboard - no learning curve here ! Other than the keys make a slight clicking sound which is a happy and productive sound to me rather than objectionable ) and the back light comes in gamer colors of blue , orchid , and red ( default is blue which I keep on ) , it is one fine keyboard . The wrist rest attachment is adjustable , as is the keyboard , and can be left off if you are short on real estate space or you choose not to use it . The keys are spaced so that getting your fingers on the wrong row or keys is minimal . I type rather fast and the keys have a substantial feel to them which I really like . The black and silver ( chrome ) color combo not only matches my laptop , printer and accessories but is very attractive . The instructions are basic and not too specific but if you have problems , there are several ways you can contact the company with questions . The keyboard , wrist attachment , and manual were neatly packaged within its own retail box and then again in the shipping box and arrived within two days after I placed my order . After seeing the Saitek Eclipse II , my son is seriously thinking about getting one to use as either backup or primary keyboard . I will gladly recommend this keyboard to my family members and friends and verse two - if something goes wrong with this keyboard on down the line , I will gladly replace it with another Saitek Eclipse .  
2	  I got the product very fast from Amazon . Since I did not need the ink that very same day , I did not need to buy it from the local store . So , I ordered from Amazon and it got to me in a week . I saved money that way and I got a good quality product .  
2	  Item works properly , fits the adapter , and was shipped and received earlier than expected ! Good price . Recommended to other buyers .  
1	  I am not an audiophile , nor a particularly tough critic for things like headphones where most products are " good enough " for my rare usage . These headphones , however , are not comfortable around the ears in my opinion . It also pulls a hair or two out of my head just about every time I take them off ( I have short hair ) . Sound quality seems fine to me , but again , I 'm not qualified to really speak to it in detail . The cord is sufficiently long which is nice .  
2	  I bought mine used from a coworker a week ago . I have used it daily and I am very happy with the lens . Built-in flash is evil to me , but the wide 1.4 aperture means I will rarely need to use my flash now . I LOVE the blurred backgrounds , especially when taking photos of my family / people .  
2	  I was looking for a great sounding set of headphones at a reasonable price , the Koss PortaPros sound as good as the expensive models at a fraction of the price . I was skeptical , but upon listening was a believer instantly .  
1	  This is a fake product .. It 's not original Sony .. if u call n ask Sony they will tel you its fake .. check it on Sony website .. it 's fake .. mine 's not even chargin the batteries ! .. i pee on this item and this seller  
1	  maxell has been one of my trusted use for blank discs for longer than i can remember . up until sometime in 2005 .. when maxell changed their discs . heres the differencethe 2004 model has the maxell guy on rhe left , and the cdr / 80/700 tihng on the right . on the top it says maxell in big letters . also if you feel the background , it is a whole lot more stable . it doesnt chip easily . also the plastic used was not scratched easily . the 2005/2006 model is a whole lot worse . it says cd-r onl eft , highlighted . on top of that it has maxell in small letters . on the right it says 80/700 and the maxell guy is right below it . the top of the disc is obviously used with cheaper material , and it scratches easily . another thing noticeable from the two is burn errors . ive had no burn errors at all with either of the 2004 models ( regular or music ) . on the 2005 model at least 80 % failed . also when using nero express i tested imation and sony cd-rs just to make sure my recorder was ok . imation had a 10 % fail rate and sony had a 0 % fail rate .. my recorder works fine . also , i tried burning at slower speed with no better results . why would imation and sony work on my computer and maxell wouldnt . because maxell cd-rs are garbage . avoid at all costs get imation sony or get maxell but only if the discs look like i explained on the 2004 modle becuase those were literally the best cdrs ive ever owned .  
1	  The battery are getting hot after charged . It is not used often . Battery life is definitely short after 1.5yrs ( they claim this is NiMH ) . I bought Energizxx , more reliable and energy . Don't waste money in this .  
2	  I 'm using the NSLU2 as a home backup server for 3 PCs . I have two USB drives connected to the NSLU2 . Disk 1 for daily backups . Disk 2 for weekly backups of Disk 1 . Works as advertised , but the user interface is anti-intuitive and painful to use . I don't use any of the fancy features ( email alerts , shares , auto-backup of Disk 1 to Disk 2 , user permissions ) because I don't need them . I 'm automatically backing up 3 NTFS PCs with Norton Ghost 9.0 with no problems . I highly recommend reading the whole manual before setting up . The only reason this server didn't get five stars is the crude user interface .  
1	  The rate for this product should be - 10 . I bought this external hard drive in 2004 , saved a couple of files , and used it sporadically ( I have other hard drives .. different brand though ) . After 1 and a half year the product started failing ( bad sectors ) , and after 2 years I got more bad sectors . I can't even format the disk . The warranty of this product is 1 year , and the only advice of their customer service is to buy a new one . They told me that to repair the product would cost more than buying a new one . Now it 's a piece of junk in my room .  
2	  This is a great radio . Light weight , small , easy to cary or attach to exercise clothing . Provides great sound and awesome color screen is easy to read at various light levels . I also bout the specialty headphones for this unit and am very impressed . They improve overall reception and sound great . Very easy set up is a bonus .  
2	  I wish I could say something special about Memorex 's CD media in comparison to other brands I 've bought and used , but I can't . They have all worked well . What I can say is that I bought this 50-Pack when it was on sale , it arrived quickly , and if it 's ever on sale when I need more , I 'll buy it again .  
1	  Love everything about this drive EXCEPT for the LACK if a ON / OFF BUTTON ! If this drive is left ON long it gets VERY HOT .. it will eventually die out if left on ! When I called IOMEGA Cust . Support , they told me the solution for dealing with this would be to unplug the drive when Im not using it and to plus it in each time I use it - HOW REDICULOUS ! POOR DESIGN because of this one , but MAJOR FLAW !  
2	  This is the best investment I 've made for my dobsonian scope . Prior to this , it was a royal pain to find objects in the sky . Now all I have to is find the object in the telrad and it 's in the middle of my eyepiece . Installation was a breeze and sighting in the telrad via the three adjustable screws was quick and painless . I can't give this device enough praise .  
2	  When looking for a new mp3 player I wanted one thing that ipod didn't offer . FM stereo . Now I know you can buy an add on but , why bother ? When I heard that MS was coming out with a 30gb and 80gb Zune I couldn't wait to get one . But like all new products there is always some drawbacks so I did wait to get one . After reading many of the crazy reviews here , I decided I would have to just take a chance . And I 'm so glad I did . I bought a 30gb from Amazon who told me I would have it by 12/19/07 . It arrived 11/22/07 . I order it 11/18/07 . Now that 's what I call service . Thanks Amazon . But now back to the device . First off , I was very impressed by the size of the screen . It 's almost 2x the size of the ipod and much brighter . The screen does resist fingerprints and scratches much better than an ipod and the unit itself seems much more durable . Downloading the software was amazing . No crashing , no freezing up just put the disc in and that was it . It basically did the set up all it 's own . It automatically synced my entire WMP11 library ( 1417 songs ) in 6mins . Then transfered all songs into the Zune library without me having to do anything . I found that to be awesome . Once I was fully charged I was ready to put it to the test . To really see if all the problem other user had did exsist . Music playback is okay . I did upgrade the earbuds w / Sony 's . Video playback Great ! Bright color , good resolution and wide screen . awesome . Videos and Movies play horizontally and the click pad changes to match the device position . Pretty neat . Battery Life is pretty good . I got about 13hrs of play and that includes using the stock video playback and my synced music collection . The FM stereo is great . Very good reception and some stations display song and artist . Very cool . I haven't had a chance to use the wireless features yet , no one I know has a Zune ( yet ) . Picture also sync easily . Just open " My Pictures " and ta da . The only drawnbacks are the limited forms of media formats it 's compatible with ( but I believe most media can be converted to what you need ) and ipod does dominate the accessories and aftermarket departments . The Zune Market place does need some upgrading but I 'm sure Bill Gates is looking into that as we speak ( or type ) . Once I recharged my Zune I got an update and it changed things a bit . I can no longer manage Zune w / WMP11 . However all music rip to WMP11 still automatically transfer to Zune . I 'm happy with my Zune and would highly recommend it . Zune might be getting a very late start in the MP3 game but it came to play and play hard . And play hard it does .  
2	  It 's a good piece of equipment . It 's fairly well sized and does the job as specified . I noticed it introduced noice onto my PC speakers when switched to headset .. Not too loud and no big issue in my case .  
2	  This is one of my favorite books by one of my favorite authors . Coupled with " the Paladin of Souls " it makes a duet of mystical fantasy .  
1	  I purchased this player 12/31/2003 and have used it no more than twice a month for maybe 45 minutes at a time on average since that time . Now it suddenly won't play any disks .. it simply keeps " loading " for hours . It 's beyond the warranty and the cost of repair exceeds the cost of the player . Go with a different brand ! I 'm giving it two stars intead of one only because it did play nicely while it lasted .  
2	  Bought a new windows 7 computer 64 Bit . Had to find a way to get my Palm Z22 to work . It took a little playing around , finally got it to work .  
2	  Cheap and it works . I have my phone line going into my cable modem . Another line comes out to the house for the phone . I needed a 3rd input for the fax machine . It works . What else can be said about something like this ?  
2	  The Sony ICF-S79V Weather Band Shower Radio is everything its advertised to be and more . Worked perfectly after batteries installed , was / is easy to preprogram stations - even an AARP senior can do it , the sound is great with plenty of volume range . Portable so use it in main bath , the shower , and outside . Wonderful reception capability . Highly recommend it !  
1	  This book was a gift to me , and I had requested it . Within a few minutes of looking at it , I knew I had made a mistake . While it has a lot of information and wonderful looking homes , like so many books about various styles of architecture , its author and photographer seem to concentrate on homes west of the Mississippi . Do they not know that there are great examples of all eras here in the Northeast ? ( I live in upstate NY ) MA is well represented in the first chapters , but after that it seems to be almost purely Chicago and points west . Also , while not all the homes are huge and clearly expensive ( a few modest homes can be found in each chapter ) , the fact that there is only one obvious ranch home - and it is a grand one - is ridiculous . Yes , many ranches are probably more modest than they want to include , but come on ? How can a serious book about " American Style Houses " ignore this style so completely ?  
2	  My ADSL got disconnected whenever I picked up the phone . Not anymore with this filter .  
1	  For the price ok i guess . unable to focus at long distance ( football Field ) of verry little use to me . I would not recommend this product  
2	  Decent battery life , easy to read ( except in direct sunlight ) and a fast USB hot sync . What more could you ask for ? Well if I were asking I would like a speaker that was a bit louder and an 8MB flash backup capability . I love the springboard slot , my two favorites , the OMNIRemote ( control anyone 's TV ! ) and the InnoVision 2 / V 2MB flash backup + vibrating alert . The color capability lets me put all of my wallet " snapshots " into my hand now . This is possible with the number of colors you can display at once ( not so on the Palm II / c ) and I can easily download maps into the unit for later retrieval when I 'm lost . I also insist on rechargable batteries ( I hate replacing batteries ) but I did manage to run out of juice when I had several alerts and didn't recharge for 3 weeks . Love the calculator ( its actually useful vis a vis the Palm standard one ) and DateBook + is an improvement as well . Every traveller should have one .  
1	  I didn't see this anywhere in any of the other reviews , but this Pen isn't compatible with MacOSX or Linux . This is unfortunate since it 'd make a great companion to my PowerBook G4 otherwise .  
2	  I am pleased with the functions and general features of the PVR . The one thing that bugs me is the PVR ERROR message that has replaced the menu icons . This is the second PVR I have owned with this same anomaly . The first , I returned within warranty to Amazon and they replaced it . Yeah Amazon ! This one I have now is past the warranty period . All the functions of the player still work ; just have to remember what icon used to be where .  
2	  I now have about 8 Lacie external USB drives and they have all been great . This one is fast , quiet , well designed and easy to install and use . Unlike the 250 GB drives , this one does have a fan , but it is whisper quiet . I acutally did not know it was there until I noticed the vents and put my finger there and could feel the air flow . Then I listened carefully and could hear it ( up close ) . But you will never notice it in normal use . Easy to install , very cool design , fast , works good . Sounds like a five to me . ;)  
1	  i was wondering if anyone else who has purchased this amp is having the same problem as me . i am using an old advent 300 as the pre-amp . the souce is either a laptop or mp3 player . at the beginning of a song or when the music is slightly muted the amp kicks off , the music stops . it 's very irritating because it give the music a halting quality . when it 's picking up the music it sounds great .. but i can't listen to it when it 's doing this . i am not an audiphile so it maybe something in the setup but it seemed pretty straight forward . thanks for any input .  
1	  The drive is speedy - no doubt about it . It had good features such as ability to create a secure and unsecure partition . But all its features are useless when the design of the product is flawed . As noted by others , the metal casing connects to a plastic ( right around the USB connection ) . That can break no matter how careful you are . When you pull the drive out of a USB port , you are applying pressure to this plastic part and it 's guaranteed to break at some point unless you 're 100 % careful all the time . It 's extremely fragile ! Having said that , I would not buy this drive if I had known this before .  
1	  I bought this product by reading some of the great features mentioned about this online . Also , I had earlier Dlink product which gave me little trouble but overall worked satisfactorily . But this product purchase is worst ever buy . This always gets disconnected and I have to reboot the router at least twice a day . I called the DLink company and their customer service is absolutely horrendous and junk . I called them thrice to get the problem resolved and those * holes just closed the call saying it is a problem with my internet service provider . If you are wise enough don't ignore my review and never try your luck against these Dlink products . It is just trash and I wasted my money on it .  
1	  Use of this filters is something of the past . Photoshop makes easier work correction after picture taken . Digital era is on .  
1	  This filter flares excessively and is unworthy of any optical system . All inventory should be recycled immediately . Once again you don't get what you don't pay for . The clear Nikon filter that I replaced this with functions very well .  
1	  i never received mystuff and amazon will not replace becuase they lost it in the mail and will not send me another thank you .  
1	  My DRT400 worked beautifully for one day . Then , on day two , its front panel said " WELCOME " and that is where it stayed . Humax tech support was unable to help , so they are sending me a new unit ( while putting a $ 400 hold on my credit card . ) It will arrive in 5 to 7 business days . That is NOT my idea of good customer service . It is also INSANE to require the use of a land line telephone connection ( which I do not have ) when the unit contains networking components . It SHOULD offer to connect to WiFi right out of the box !  
2	  This was a very easy to install product , instructions were clear , craftsmanship is good . Its classic black look is exactly what we were looking for , and the price is very reasonable . Sound quality is great .  
1	  If the product matches the photo , it is a Zire 71 cable . The Zire 72 uses two connectors , a mini-USB and a circular power connector . I 've been bitten already with the wrong cable from a different seller . It cost me return shipping to get my payment back . I 've found most of the 154,000 Web pages from a search for " zire 72 travel charger " have the same error . It 's only good for one star because zero stars isn't accepted .  
1	  Customer service by e-mail was unable to provide useful information on how to use this product with a G3 Powerbook running OS 8.6 . I was told that a required extension is " Toast USB Iomega Bridge , " which doesn't come with the software supplied . The online person at Iomega sent me to Adaptec for an upgrade ( Toast 413 OEM ) which I installed but which didn't enable me to copy anything . He then brushed me off with the suggestion that I check whether my media ( which I had told him had been supplied by Iomega ) was compatible with the product . When I asked whether we shouldn't be tracking down a source for the missing extension , I was told to refer further inquires to the phone line-which is so backed up as to be virtually useless .  
2	  I run a webcomic and needed a way to scan in pictures quickly and correctly eliminating all of my eraser marks . After some research and a look at where to store it I settled on my CanoScan . I ordered and received it , simple set up , literal plug and play with the USB port . I was up and running in three minutes flat . The scans for my black and whites are perfect and are done in record time . The scans of images are with little white dots on them , but a shrinking of the picture to a realistic size quickly eliminates that . I 've worked with a number of scanners and am thoroughly impressed by this one for its scan time ( usually less than 30 seconds ) , and its incredibly small size . If you 're looking for a scanner for a limited workspace , or scanning images for relatives , this is your product .  
1	  I bought one and I am returning it ! The box and all the other propaganda states easy to setup and use . Whatever ! After messing with it for over three hours with no luck and another two hours with Netgear Tech Support , no luck . Although tech support guy was very knowledgable , he was at a complete loss as to why it wouldn't work . It recognized my drives I had installed , however , it wouldn't create them so I could use them . Instead of being able to use the drives as is . Netgear decided it needed to create it 's own file system . This is definately a " plug and pray " piece of equipment . I think Netgear had an intern design and write the application for this . They also need to really test it to make sure it works in many types of network environments instead of some lab . I am returning mine as soon as possible . If you are looking at buying a NAS sytem don't buy this one . Go with D-Links or the Buffalo . Although more expensive , they seem to have very good reviews .  
1	  Do NOT be deceived by the title . The product you get is NOT made by Sima . It 's actually done by Adorama . And here are the differences : ( i ) string is not as long as the original Sima piece ( ii ) instead of providing a solid disc at one end , the disc is actually covered by a sticker ( ii ) the sticker is hardly sticky . The general build is much poorer than the same thing from Sima . Do not be cheated by Adorama . In fact , it 's better to buy from B & H ; than Adorama .  
1	  The sound is average & the durability is fair . They lasted a month and they broke . I bought a pair Sony headphones & they have been great . Overall , I would not recommend them .  
2	  I purchased this camera because it has most of the manual features of the Canon G2 & G3 models , but it is much more compact and has a reputation for taking great pictures at the automatic settings . That was a big plus as I 'm new to photography as a hobby . I have not been disappointed . In fact , it has exceeded every expectation . Thus far , I have been unable to take a bad picture using the automatic settings ! The downside of this ( if you can call it a downside ) is that it made me a little lazy about learning all the manual adjustments and features to customize a shot ! .. but I am learning them because this is the greatest , most fascinating little electronic gadget I have ever had ! I Haven't had it very long , but so far a very reliable product . If you are like me and hestiant to pursue photography as a hobby because of the potential for wasting film and processing with a traditional camera while learning the craft , this is the ideal digital camera for a novice . For the money , I can't imagine a better product . Very high quality , hefty for its small size but it gives a sense of confidence . Some other cameras feel like toys compared to it . The only reason to avoid this model is that it doesn't have interchangable lenses-but that 's the ONLY reason-and you have to get a larger , more expensive model to get that flexibility .  
2	  I like how the plug-ins are arranged and color coordinated . I have had no problems with any electrical surges as of yet . Since I live in central Florida I 'm hoping I won't have to find out just how well or not this surge protector works .  
2	  Great little photo printer . You can fix & crop images from it 's screen , make wallet sized photos or add Disney borders to your pictures ! The only con is the printer ink . If you go for more than a couple of weeks without using it , you have to do maintenance to get the colors right which can waste the photo paper . Be sure to shake the ink cartridge before use .  
1	  If you 're planning on doing any movement with it , then find another pair of earbuds . I used these at the gym and the left earbud failed within a few months . Then again , at this price I really shouldn't have expected much more than that . That being said , the sound quality actually is decent . And it blocks outside sounds pretty well .  
2	  The Pac Swix interfaced with my JVC head unit brilliantly . It was a little tedious to program , but I got it the second time around . As far as a delay goes , it 's not really a constant delay . Sometimes you press the button and get an immediate response and sometimes you need to press the button once more because of a non responsive press . The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because there is a difference between the stock headunit 's response and the aftermarket 's . It really does give you flexibility as far as programming goes since you can assign a button a function of your choice . Simple three wire hookup to my Mercury was nice too . I say if you like your steering wheel controls and you have a JVC , Alpine , or other compatible unit , then you need this little box for your install .  
2	  this video card owns all video cards in the entire world the graphics are amazing at 320x240 NO CHOPPINESS ! my old ATI Radeon 9700 had choppiness at 320x240 . This is just amazing  
2	  Este es mi primer producto BOSE . Siempre lo pensaba dos veces por su costo . Realmente he quedado impresionado , el sonido es espectacular para una caja de sonido tan peque & ntilde ; a . Ademas que el dise & ntilde ; o es realmente hermoso . Es todo un lujo . Si usted puede darselo , no lo piense dos veces , dese gusto .  
2	  For an overseas buyer is a must to have a good support , the card gave me conflicts with my sound blaster and in less than 3 hours I had received from adaptec an extensive and comprehensive explanation of what I had to do !  
1	  I bought this for a job hunt figuring I could print out some nice resumes and envelopes and use the fax for communication . I haven't used the fax yet ( and never will because I 'm returning it ) . With 24lb bond paper you can only put 20 or so sheets in the tray or it jams and creases the edge of the paper . It curls the pages , not a show-stopper but just another item on the list of things I hate about this printer . The worst part and the straw that broke the camel 's back for me is that 24lb bond # 10 envelopes fed one at a time through the manual feed slot come out curled , creased and with ghost images of the addresses all across the envelope , totally useless .  
2	  I just bought an eMachines for a cheapie PC to work alongside my trusty G5 . I had virtual PC but it rna like molasses . With Vista preinstalled on the eMachines , I 'm a little worried about the speed , too . At first the switch didn't work , because I still had my Mac mouse attached to the keyboard instead of in the right port on the switch , after i changed that , it all worked smoothly . I agree that the audio is really poor . so I removed the speakers from the jack on the switch . But , overall so far so good . I hope it lasts . ; )  
1	  The player works ok if you never ever want to skip the previews . If you love watching all the adds that come with disks and do not mind waiting 15 min or so to start the movie buy this player . Actually most samsung players are like this . They generate nice video output . But they make it almost impossible to skip the previews . I hate being forced to watch all the previews so it drives me up the wall . They disable the ff and skip button along with all the menu options . Ie they are a good licensee and not a company for me .  
2	  Works great , easy to put on , and the quality of the protector is great . I buy a lot of B + W products . Good products , good brand .  
2	  Typically when you order cat 5 cableing there are connectors already on it up untill you hit about 100 feet , After that they assume that you are setting up a network and are going to attach the wire to plug boxes . As for what this cable was intended for it works like every other network cable and is a pretty average price for cable in my area at about . 16 cents a foot . So if you want to run a in line network in a normal house or small business then this should be sufficent for several computers when cut .  
1	  I LOVE their product ! BUT this particular bottle had a petrified ink blotter . I 'm NOT kidding ! It was hard as a rock ! I had to chip away until I 'd made a small hole through it , in order to gain access to the ink . Then I was able to refill my inkpad .  
2	  These reflectors are VERY large and GREAT quality . They are worth the money .. HOWEVER , the weight of the reflectors , when on the stand , make it top heavy . You 'll have to anchor it with sand bags . Other than that , I am happy with my purchase . In my opinion , the reflectors alone are worth the money . the stand is okay .. the " boom " is the issue . Additionally , the clips that hold the reflector on can be a REAL pain to get on . A diagram of how to put them on would have made life a LOT easier the first time . I am giving the 4 rating based on the size and quality of the reflectors .  
1	  Ok , I read all the reviews and was really excited for this remote saying how easy it was to set up . I would consider myself an above average technology person considering just a few weeks ago I had to figure out how to download my own firmware to my computer , burn a dvd , and then update my blue ray player . That being said .. this remote was incredibly hard to set up . I still have not figured it out and to make everything worse it changed all of my TV settings and now almost nothing is in HD even though the settings are saying they are . Ugg , so frustrating !  
1	  Turns out the cleaner solution is DISTILLED WATER . Cloth covered " brush " not really large enough to get a good handle on it . Could so as well with a towel and water . NOT WORTH THE PRICE >  
1	  This was the worst camera ! The installation was easy , but most are . THE PICTURE QUALITY IS [ bad ] ! PLEASE dont waste your money on this , I am going to try the 4000 model tomorrow , so I will come back and give a review on that as well . I 'm hoping the CCD on the 4000 will improve the quality .  
2	  I got this keyboard & mouse combo from HP with a PC I bought . Used it for about a year and I have no complaints . It has a nice feel to the keyboard , responsive and just the right resistance to the pressure . The mouse is also excellent and I 've had no complaints so far . My son complained that it became unresponsive after moving about 5 -6 feet away , so maybe those complaints are justified . A USB extension cord should remedy that though , but then you have a cord again ! Pluging the USB receiver into a front USB port should also extend the range .  
2	  The chips are good as expected , but paid for one day delivery to get them in time for a wedding . They arrived a day too late , but Amazon refunded the extra shipment charge . Still required locally purchasing spare chips at higher cost . Just try to order with enough lead time .  
1	  This was a great little system - compact , great sound , easy to use . Then , one day , without warning , it just stopped working . I tried a number of things including changing the remote battery , but to no avail . I really need something I can rely on to work for more than 6 months .  
1	  I have a self-built dual-core machine running Vista and 8 gigs of RAM . I have Verizon FIOS for internet service . While my PS3 , my iMac G5 , and my roommate 's Powerbook G4 all work well , the Trendnet wireless PCI adapter is lucky to work for more than a few minutes at a time , and even then very slow . In addition , the utilities required to run it create another layer of software to have to work through to get your connection , and it 's bare-bones . Windows Vista doesn't really understand how to get it to ask for an IP address , so there 's little you can do to prod it into life . Sometimes , Vista doesn't even recognize the card is there , suggesting plugging in an ethernet cable . It sounds like I 'm not alone in having problems with this card , and while it clearly works well for some people , I 'd have to say you 're definitely rolling the dice . The price is hard to beat for something that works , but easy to beat if it doesn't . My advice : save the packaging and be ready to have to return it .  
1	  I 've had this router for about 9 months now and it drops the connection about once every 2-3 days . Many times all the lights on the unit go dark . Remove the power plug and reinsert and it will work again for another 2-3 days . Belkin support has been no help and firmware upgrades don't work . Total piece of junk . Will be switching to Linksys .  
2	  Still going strong after 10 years , amazing ! We use it often and at times very heavily . Have been using generic ink from Amazon for years with no problems and this thing never has a paper jam . Hope my next one does as well .  
1	  I have to tell you the disappointment with this product is great . I am on my third one . the four rubber stoppers you have to put in to raise the notebook do not stay in place , The cord which goes in to your USB port is very fragile , and the replacement USB port has cracked off on two of these . Cooling element works , if you do not have the rubber stoppers falling out all the time . I recommend buying a cooler that has rise built in . I would never recommend this to anyone .  
1	  The only reason I purchased this item is because it uses the same fan that my AOpen mini-pc has , and that went south . If I could find this fan at Fry 's or someplace else , or if AOpen actually had a technical support staff that responded to inquiries , I wouldn't had to pay $ 35 for a $ 5 fan ( the alternative being to toss a $ 1000 computer ) . My low rating for this item is entirely based on my opinion of the fan . I am already on my 3rd CPU fan for this computer ( thus I have bought 2 disk enclosures ) , so I would suggest this fan is absolute junk .  
2	  I have to be honest I too was skeptical of this camera till I bought one in late October . This camera is amazing ! Some might say well the digial camera part of it isn't that good but it is still 3.0 megapixels and you can record on DVD 's ! The best thing though about this camera is that you can hook this thing up to your computer and make music videos if you want using your own MP3 's ! I know that they will make other DVD camcorders but right now it is the best even with the high price tag I have to say that it is well worth it . I have enjoyed mine way more than I ever thought that I would .  
1	  A lot of them did not work and went to the trash . It might of been a bad batch .  
1	  I bought this used " Motorola Surfboard SB5101 Cable Modem " I used about 4 months . @ , hnever touch it when it work . But it does work now . I can't surf in internet since yesterday . I have to distrust used products on amazon . Disappointed .  
2	  This cable is 7 feet long . When you plug one end into your computer and the other end into your cable modem , your computer gets Internet .  
2	  We installed the amplifier following the directions , and it works wonderfully well . As advertised . Bill Affleck  
2	  I am very pleased with the Norcent DVD player . It has shown itself to be able to play mp3 's , cdr / w 's without any problem whatsoever . What really caught my attention was its ability to play mpeg file formats directly burned onto cd .  
2	  We tried the wireless trackman that is exactly like this one , except the cord obviously , and could not get the wireless version to track consistently and it frustrated the pagebees out of us . My wife and I have individual computers and I had this corded model and never had any problems . I thought she was nuts and switched with her to prove that she was nuts .. she wasn't . For some reason the wireless just cut out some times and it was very frustration . This corded version works perfectly every and all the time .. we love them .  
1	  The Transcent 4GB SD memory is worthless . We bought one for our Cannon Digital Camera , used it once for about 5 days on vacation and it stopped working . Could not get it to respond in the camera nor in our computer . All pictures and video lost ! Vendor will not replace ( as if we want another of the same .. ) due to the fact that 30 days have passed since purchase ! ( We were in Costa Rica for 3 weeks .. ) DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ! DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE !  
2	  Not much to say . Used this to give protection to wires in my engine bay for a " Big 3 " upgrade project . Works great .  
1	  I was looking for a way to recharge my music player and laptop for a flight to and back from Hawaii . I did not realize I was getting something so large and heavy , but I figured it would do the job . Unfortunately , even after 48 hours on charge , the battery remained dead . I gave it two stars mostly out of hope , but partly because the Black and Decker customer service seems to have their act together . Even so , Black and Decker would not help because I bought it through Amazon and it was within the 30 day return window . Amazon would not replace the unit because it is sold by a partner company . So I returned it ( easy process - nice ) . The date code on the unit said 2007 , making me think that I was delivered a 3 year old product and wondering how long these things will last . I am planning on trying again , but am not holding out too much hope that I won't again get an old unit that won't work or will fail within a year or two .  
1	  In a short amount of time working with Sonicwalls , I discovered quite a few issues . I do not recommend Sonicwall as a result . Perhaps the CONS below won't affect you , but at least be aware of them . PROS : Small form factor for UTMCONS : Horrible customer service ( outsourced to India , unless you are certified ) Long wait for customer serviceDynamic DNS client bug that has yet to be resolved ( see below ) No DNS proxy intelligence for Split-Brain / Split horizon setupVery weak DHCP server options , only basicsPoor documentationCustomer Service : First off , understand that level 1 is outsourced to India . I tried opening an incident via their web interface , and after several days without progress , I decided to call . The customer service number I dialed put me on hold right after selecting Tech Support . At some point ( 30 minutes later ) an individual answered , and collected my details , and put me back on hold . About an hour later , the system forced me to leave a message and hung-up . I tried this several times , until I finally did get through to tech support . Now the first person that answers the phone and collects details ( to help route the call ) , fails ( or they lack the mechanism ) to notify the final tech-support person , so you must repeat the details of your case ( I mean seriously , is it terribly difficult to relay such details ? ) . The VOICE quality ( of the call ) is terrible , I imagine they are using VOIP to backhaul calls to India , and using high compression , bandwidth saving techniques which result in low quality ( I specialize in VOIP , and I know what they do to save money ) . This makes life rather difficult when already dealing with heavily accented / overly polite tech support in India . The Dynamic DNS bug is quite simple . If you are getting the Enhanced O / S with the hopes of using dual ISP links ( active / passive ) and plan to use Dynamic DNS to maintain a simple hostname to dynamic ip mapping , you are out of luck . Dynamic DNS client on the Sonicwall is BOUND to the Primary WAN interface ( how stupid is that ? ) . They don't support Split Brain ( aka Split horizon ) DNS , in fact their DNS capabilities are non-existent . The other major players in this field support this , why not Sonicwall ? DHCP - Where to begin ? Its featureless , as weak as you can get it . It supports ( options ) DNS , WINS , Gateway , and a " callmanager " option . Thats it . Poor documentation : I was trying to tunnel all my VPN traffic ( both inbound to lan , and internet ) . Getting this done was difficult , because of non-existent documentation on the subject . You need to add some special NAT rules to support this , but NOWHERE is this indicated . I tried communicating my disappointments to my Sonicwall sales rep , but it seems he can't " do anything about it " . Sonicwall does not listen to customers ( or at least in my size of business ) - simply out of touch . I strongly recommend you consider another vendor ( perhaps one of the top 2 ) , as Sonicwall is out of touch with customers , and have a weak offering overall .

1	  I just ordered a 5 pack of Epson # 78 hi capacity ink cartridges and before I made the purchase , Amazon recommended the 6th color to add to my order . So I placed the order and a couple of minutes later , I realized that Amazon recommended the ink cartridge in black for the wrong printer . When I went to cancel it a few minutes later , I got a message saying " sorry but it 's too late now to cancel " . That was about 5 minutes after I placed the order . I 've been a long time customer of Amazon , but on their wrong recommendation , they should have at least given me a chance to cancel , as they made the wrong offer to begin with . Shame on you Amazon . There are many other online stores on the internet . If this is the shody business practices they are resorting to , all I have to say is " Goodbye " after many years of purchases !  
1	  The item did not work in my location , so I returned it in it 's original package as per instructions . I hope that I get the credit back as I used my credit card to purchase it . I returned it last month .  
1	  I purchased this in the belief that it would work and look as good as new . Well yes it does seem to work well . But the drawback is looks and it has tha appearance of being old and tired . I believe enough said as the company who sold it tried to get extra money for a better conditioned one .  
2	  I absolutely love this card ! Its price can't be beat and it provides a reliable Internet connection . It works flawlessly ( and on the first connection attempt to ! ) with WPA . It gets lightning fast signal from my router that is on the other side of my house . I couldn't ask for more in terms of performance and value . BTW , the drivers included on the CD will get the card up and running .. but download the newest drivers from the manufacturer 's website . Those new drivers make all the difference : It greatly increases the signal strength and connection speed . In addition , the physical PCI card is very low profile . It sits right next to my video card on my motherboard and doesn't affect airflow from the GPU cooling fan . If you 're looking for a reliable wireless card , look no further !  
2	  I was concerned about this product because I 'm 5'3 " with short legs . I half expected to be sending this back because it would hang over my knees and / or put the laptop up so high on my chest I wouldn't be able to work with it . To my surprise it fits me very well . It does just fit to edge of my knees but I don't feel like it will flip off . Typing height is good . My husband is 6 ' tall with long legs and he said it 's also comfortable for him . This thing is nothing fancy but it does exactly what I need it to do . We use it with the widest side face up because my laptop is 16 " . My rating is strictly based on confortable positioning for both short and tall people . I can't address the cooling factor because my new laptop doesn't get hot . Also , I don't use the cubby slot in the middle . It doesn't look to me like you can fit much in there though . Another plus is the portability factor . It 's very lightweight and not as cumbersome as you 'd think . We use it for sitting on a recliner , couch , or bed .  
2	  I guess a cable either works or it does not work . The one I got works well .  
1	  I bought this transmitter for my daughter 's birthday and it broke off in the cigarette lighter the first time it was used . It also blew the fuse . I would look for another brand with the same features .  
2	  What can I say . It works just like the one that came with my Canon camera since it is the same one . This is always better than other brands that are rated for the camera .  
2	  The Samsung L77 works well for me . While the pushbutton controls are quirky , a little practice and I 've become pretty good at operating this camera . I very much like the 7X optical telephoto lens because that allows me to carry only one camera , and in my shirt pocket ! I also very much like that this camera does all that inside and nothing sticks out when turned on , or when adjusting the telephoto lens . The quality is high . The metal case is durable . The rechargable battery lasts well , and the charger is fairly small and charges in less that an hour . A second battery was inexpensive so I can keep going .  
2	  These earphones works Great . I got them for my MOM and the sound is more than enough loudness . It replaces one of my cheap Ipod immitation earphones that always kept dieing and falling apart . Sony Earphones are awesome and this one worked great for me . Its Just perfect on my Ipod Touch . Not to mention the Great Price . Thanks Sony For the Awesomeness  
1	  Our Philips DVD Home Theatre System HTS3450 just lost all its sound . It is really too bad as the DVD player still works , just no sound . We had it for about 2 years . I hate the thought of having to fill a landfill with all this plastic just because a company can't make a lasting product . I will be looking for a better made system to replace this one . Save your money and the environment and find a better made product .  
2	  I recently purchased this mp3 player to replace and older failing flash player . The yp-u2j seems to work great thus far . The sound is fantastic . The battery charges quickly and lasts at least 10-12 hours when used conservatively . It is apparently replaceable but you have to open the unit up which would void the warranty . It fully charges in about 2.5 hours via the usb . The fm tuner works quite well , even getting some stations that i cannot receive on my home stereo . The headphone jack is on the side of the unit and not the top so if you don't have a right angle headphone plug it may get annoying . I find it to have really nice sound . The only real problem I have with it is that directions are not as friendly as they could be . I had an issue with FF and RW large files but i have discovered that you can manually adjust the FF and RW interval to be from 1 sec to 1 min VERY convenient as I listen to large 3 + hour files frequently . You can also change the skip feature from skip to next file to skip ahead at an interval from 1 sec to 1 min . This is a great feature that is surprising to find on such a small player . I think i now give it 4.5 stars .. The only negative is you must have WinXP and Media player 10 to manage files ..  
2	  iPod family is all about style and usability . When you are buying this , you shouldn't focus too much on its capacity or price . If you are looking for big capacity or cheap price , there will be many others more suitable for you . * charge it fully , 4 + hrs , before use . otherwise a lot of problems will occur and you will be in gadget hell * the good : 1 . light and small , travel friendly . 2 . a perfect balance of capacity and price . why buy 20GB when you will never use that much ? that would be like buying 10 pairs of shoes when you will only wear one . ok , a lot of you do that , ladies . 3 . the headset is high quality , that 's not true for most other mp3 players . 4 . superb usability in hardware and software . 5 . can hold your word documents and can hold your vacation photos if you get one of those belkin brdige thing . the bad : 1 . MUST BE FULLY CHARGD FIRST . you have been warned , TWICE . 2 . not all that sturdy , it is made of hard drive , not flash memory , so it 's easily broken if you drop it a few times . Handle with care . i.e. don't take it to workout . 3 . less individuality since 1/2 of the population buy this , at least that 's what I read in the magazine . 4 . locks up when some users , I 'm not familiar with that , but it seems that it happens to a few of them , but it 's self-repairable . Got it when checking price on WhoSave , also a good list of superior products : $U$ recommend it to you if you enjoy the better things in life and capable of taking care of delicate objects . have fun  
2	  The card came carefully packed and in perfect condition . It also arrived prior to the date they promised .  
2	  Sigma 30mm f / 1.4 EX DC HSM Lens for Sigma Digital SLR CamerasI bought this lens for my Sigma SD14 and it is superb . On the SD14 it acts as a 51mm standard lens for 35mm full framed dslr . Its also available in other camera mounts for Nikon and Canon . It focuses quickly , limited by the cameras own AF system . Good prime lens for the money . At F2.0 or higher the lens is sharp from center to the edges . Below that , it softens below f2.0 towards the edges . Produces pleasing bokeh . I recommend this lens .  
1	  The Canon Powershot A710 IS that I received had a horribly blurry optical viewfinder . I wondered if it was just mine , so I visited some local stores . The A710 at the local stores also had blurry viewfinders , but not quite as bad as the one that I received . I searched the internet and found others who experienced the same problem . I 've looked at Pentaxs , Sonys , Kodaks , and Fugifilms , and all their viewfinders are very sharp . It looks like Canon has a quality control problem with this camera . I returned mine for refund due to the defective viewfinder .  
2	  just what i wanted i do music production and i needed a trackball mouse that would definately speed u my workflow and this was it , had for over a year now and its still going , i would definately buy this item again .  
2	  When I bought this camera , was a little skeptical about Kodak but to my surprise the camera has performed above expectations . The easyshare software is pretty helpful too . I also have a compact Canon SD 1100IS but got to say I find Kodak 712 results far better . The results in low light were a little .. " low " but using this camera with a tripod during night gave better performance .  
2	  I wasn't real confident about buying these a year ago . I was worried about buying a speaker I 'd never heard about and couldn't find much info on . But now I can't say enough about BIC 's ! Take it from me , if you are looking for a good home theater speaker that will fill your room with crystal clear sound buy these ! And no , I don't work for Amazon or BIC . I don't know of any other brand that gives the sound that these do at Amazon prices . I 've got these with the DV-62 center and couldn't be more satisfied . Fantastically clear with impressive bass . They sound much more expensive then they are .  
2	  This is the easiest camera that I 've ever used . The pictures are clear and crisp . The zoom-in and zoom-out is effortless and you don't have to worry about rolls of film . Everything about this camera is EASY ! If I can use it , everyone can use it . It ' great . The only thing you have to remember , don't hold the camera up to your eye . Thank you , Jean Fling  
2	  When I purchased the Tiffen 52mm , 58mm , and 72mm UV filters , I was expecting a good solid product for my lens . What I did not expect is the high improvement in overall picture quality for both ( day AND night ) shots . I am more than satisfied with Tiffen filters . Being that it 's ' Tiffen ' I expect nothing less .  
1	  Superb cam , picture quality is excellent - so is handling . According to several reports in internet unfortunately large quantity seems to be affected with tape transfer noise , the one I bought too . For more info see ww . akuutti . netKind Regards , PKa  
1	  When I got this , the blue power light bearly worked , and now it doesn't work at all . It 's very hard to tell if I 've turned it on or off unless it 's plugged into a music player and a radio is on to the right station .  
1	  I purchased this to replace my Monster brand cassete converter . I used it on my iPhone 4 on a 2004 Inifiniti G35x and decided to get a new one because the Monster one produced an irritating screaching / interference type noise which was difficult to get rid of . However , when I put in the Belkin Cassette Adapter , it didn't play any bass . Not that the bass was bad or not enough of it .. it completely left it out . I swapped b / w the Monster and the Belkin to check a few songs and played with the settings on my car , but the Belkin just didn't produce any bass . The sound quality was horrible . Returning .  
2	  Well , I have used this product with more than 100 t-shirt and I have no complains . After my 3 first big trials .. a really mess .. It is easy to transfer ( once you get used with the process ) , it is a fast process , and the image stay for a long time on the fabric . Of course , the transfer will not last forever , but after 100 + washing cycles , all of my t-shirt still are in PERFECT condition . I use soft soap , and a soft washing machine cycle . The most important words here , are : VERY high temp iron ( mine is one with 1400 watts ) , very VERY high pressure when ironing ( I sweat a lot in this process ) and the fabric must be as flat and firm as possible ( porous fabrics are not the best , as well as stretching ones like cotton-lycra are not a good option because when stretching , the image breaks ) . One last note : it is for white fabric . If you try it over other color , the image 's colors will be different from intended . If the fabic is dark colored , you will not see anything after trasferring . This is because the WHITE color of the image after ironing comes from the fabric , so if within the image are white and shiny teeth , and the fabric is dark , the teeth will be black , as well as all the other light colors of the images .  
2	  Great product at a great price . It comes from Washington State and I am in the midwest so it took a long time to reach me but it was worth the wait .  
1	  I purchased this PDA in 2008 .. and again in 2010 because the battery died on the first one . The battery on the second one lasted 1 month and it died . This PDA had so many bugs . It crashed frequently and 150 bucks is way too much money to plunk down on anything as unreliable as this PDA was for me . It 's hard for me to understand why this PDA gets such good reviews . I could understand getting one " lemon " .. but 2 ? .. in 4 years ? Poor resolution and nearly impossible to use in any type of light . Sorry .. but this product is overrated and just plain awful .  
2	  My wife and I really wanted to get a super-zoom once our baby became mobile . Unfortunately my old Canon Elph died and forced us to buy something right now . Neither of us are even close to amateur photographers , but we 've had excellent results with this camera . I was a little intimidated by the complexity , but the menu 's are well layed out and the equipment seems to compensate for my lack of skill . The only minor complaint I have is that the controls a bit plasticy ( is that a word ? ) We 'll see how it holds up

2	  Considering the length this cable has worked great . A bit cumbersome for home use , more of a pro situation cable . I absolutely recommend this cable .  
1	  When I saw this laptop bag in the store , I was excited to finally find a stylish laptop bag . I bought it to use it for carrying my travel laptop to conferences . Three months ( 4 conferences and at most 14 days of use ) later , the first strap broke and I almost dropped my laptop on the marble floor . The chique design is unfortunately not enough to cover the lousy quality .  
2	  I 've been using this camera for about a year and a half and have previously owned multiple point and shoot digital canon cameras . This camera allows a level of creativity unavailable with the other cameras . I have taken numerous pictures that people have asked " Where did you get that print ? " It is easy to use but has all the power you would expect from a SLR . I didn't buy the kit lens and opted for some higher quality lenses that have served me very well . Since others have listed pros and cons very well here are the highlights for me : Pros : SLR400 + shots on a single chargeFast shutter releaseExpandabilityCons : Doesn't fit in your pocket  
1	  The overwhelming 5 star reviews is what helped me decide to choose this trimmer . But it 's so not worth the price . It does work on trimming hair that is more than a quarter of an inch , but if you are looking for a closer trim - this item is not for you . Positives - its sleek , and very quiet .  
2	  I love the speaker the moment it arrived at my door step . Thank you to my housemate who help me set up the whole system . It took us less than 10 minutes to set it up ( without including unboxing and taking all the components out of the box ) . Hook up to the TV via optical cable . Great sound and great surround . Hook up to PS3 and played Final Fantasy XII . Amazing effect and surround . Highly recommend  
1	  Having owned several HP printers over many years , I have noticed a steady and unforgivable decline in the quality of this company 's printers with each successive model . The final straw for me is the 7960 , by far the worst HP printer I have owned . While producing acceptable prints under most conditions , this printer 's liabilities far outweigh its benefits . The workmanship of the unit itself is the flimsiest and most disappointing I have encountered . And the printer 's lack of consistent compatibility with the two separate computers I have used it with is both annoying and inexcusable for a supposedly renowned printer company . Bad drivers have caused numerous problems and the driver updates usually make the situation only marginally better . Plus the printer 's general overuse of ink and poor paper and envelope handling make the overall experience of owning one distinctly unappealing . This is my last HP printer - I 'll be switching to Epson .  
2	  The lens is great ! Just as advertised and as good as new with a less expensive price tag . Customer service was very helpful with some questions I had prior to purchasing . The lens and the vendor are both great !  
2	  this is the best solution for home security ! It works just as they say it does ! I love it . Not only can I see who is at the door I can talk to them easily . No home should be without this item . It 's easy to install , just takes a minute .  
2	  I use this backpack just for my laptop and its accessories . It is very cushioned making my laptop feel lighter than it is . I don't know how I 'm supposed to use that strap they say is meant for the cell phone but overall I would definitely recommend this product .  
1	  The vertical steam is useless , the cordless functions is convenient , however the ironing potential is very short it will iron an area no longer that the size of a sheet of paper before it cools again needing to be place back in the charging base . Therefore ironing with this iron takes longer , the great feature is that it goes off by itself when idol , making it great for seniors like myself .  
1	  My Zen Vision M locked up several times over several months . The last time , it was permanent . I had to contact their customer support to begin the process of getting it fixed in the middle of January . I received incorrect information regarding product availability , long waits for the sync adapter to come back into stock before I could attempt to reload firmware ( I lost it ; my mistake ) , and finally after getting an RMA approval have now been waiting 17 business days from their date of receiving it for them to get replacement stock . They quote an average of 10 , but ask you to contact them if it is longer than 15 days . I have been told that they are going to replace it once they get stock back in . Although they have units to sell in stock , this does not mean that they use them to honor their warranty with . They will not give any sort of estimate when they may have replacement stock . Also , their web RMA status page may not get updated , or may post incorrect status . Oh , one other interesting feature of their support is that if you don't have a support contract and the unit is older than 3 months old , you have to pay another $ 25.00 for the testing . In the almost 2 months of dealing with this , Creative Labs has lost me as a customer , which I have been for over 10 years . Aside from the lockups , I liked the unit . I now have an iPod that I love and also had to use Apples ' Customer Support services . No problems . They dealt with the problem in a professional and efficient manner .  
1	  Three years later , it died . For the price , I guess it did its job . The switches on the headphone are completely USELESS . There is no sound difference ! It is a lie .  
2	  This is a decent product . Easy to put together even for a senior female like me . Holds almost as many DVDs as it claims . Would get more .  
2	  Great storage solution for my daughter . She had it put together before I got home . Nice shape for her teenage room .  
2	  It 's important to me if a produce is easy to use so I won't get tired of using it soon . I 've had this for a long time . It works beautifully . No problem ever . Simple to use . Plug it in and there are the pictures .  
1	  I was on the phone with D-Link Tech Support within 20 minutes of setting this thing up . I unplugged a Wired Netgear router that was working fine . Brought the entire system down and then installed . I followed the directions and being a Computer and Network support person at a Major Corporation I know how to set things like this up . Well Nothing worked . I got on the phone with tech support ( very nice people but heavy accents ) and we began troubleshooting . Effectively i could talk to the ISP and get a IP addy from them but no name resolution . Finally after 40 minutes the thing seemed to start working and that lasted all of about 10 minutes . I had nothing more than 2 wireless laptops and a single Wired desktop on the switch . Oddly enough I took one of the laptops up to my daughters room and it found one of my neighbors Linksys network and connected to that with no problems . My reccomendation is spend the few extra dollars and get the Linksys , i know from first hand experience the D-Link doesnt work and the linksys does . The D-link is on its way back right now .  
1	  I ordered the Monster THXV100F8WHT but instead received an inferior cable the Monster SV100F-8 WHT . I already had opened the package before realizing I had the wrong cable in hand . Gathering from what I read about Amazon 's return policy I could no longer return it due to already opening the package , however upon contacting them , Amazon refunded my purchase and issued a return label . So I am happy to report Amazon did their best to make things right . Hopefully anyone else ordering the THXV100F8WHT will get what they paid for . The cable I got appears to be Monsters bottom of the line .  
1	  The camera is okay , and the pictures are okay , but I 've had to return two of them because the USB / downloading feature from the camera stopped working . Customer support is bad - after 90 days they want to charge me [ $ ] dallars to fix it - this is for labor ( one year warranty covers just parts ) . There seems to be a problem with this feature - I wish I did my research beforehand - I would have never purchased this camera .  
1	  It works well if there is no cordless phones ( GHz range operating ones ) in the vicinity . I tried various setup configs but gave up due to Interference and distortions . Finally I chose the phone line transmitting one ( since I had a phone line close by ) and that really helped . The model number is LF-10s made by Terk also . see its review elsewhere by me here at amazon .  
2	  This is a great little camera ! the photos are quick and clear . processing time is a lot less than my last olympus . This little gem fits in your pocket nicely for quick easy access while on the go . Great little camera .. love it !  
1	  The cartridge life is pathetic and a rip off , sorry to say . It doesn't bode well for the company in terms of ethical advertising . i feel like i am replacing one each month with about 500 pages - very limited use . In a short period of time , i have paid more for the cartridges than i did the darn printer . I am averaging $ 800 per year for cartridges . You have got to be kidding . The printer itself is ok so far , however . I would suggest if there are " compatible " cartridges at significantly less price , they may be worth trying , especially if they advertising the same specs . does anyone have any experience with similar products ? Thank you .  
2	  I bought this unit off ebay for $ 40.00 in the door . I am an audiophile with more than $ 70,000.00 of audio equipment in the house and bought this on a whim for my girlfriends house who is happy with an AM / FM radio if you know what I mean . First she had no idea how to run an Ipod , smart woman just electroniclly challenged . Plugged it in , plugged in the ipod and off you go . Easiest thing on the plant , sounds great and would loose and arm if I tryed to bring it back to my place . Just bought another tonight for $ 36.00 including shipping . Oh ! This thing looks great and very well built . Beautiful black piano finish . BUY ON YOU WON'T BE SORRY .  
1	  Contrary to the description , this is not a clock radio . Amazon 's description is deceptive - you need a newer iPod model , otherwise this unit doesn't function as a clock radio . To add a further insult , seller will not refund shipping charges and Amazon ignored the problem . Buyer beware .  
2	  I received the Monster Cable SS-4 Speaker Selector the other day and was doubtful when I first opened the package . DON'T BE ! This is an excellent product and is better than advertised . It was easy to install , works great , clear sound , no decrease in power . Had no problem with the speaker connections clamps , used 16 gauge wire . Shop around for best price , but would be hard to beat at any price .  
1	  The primary purpose of this cable is to allow the user to connect two computers via serial port for file ( and sometimes printer ) sharing . While this still works , only DOS 6.22 and Windows 9x support it ( under INTERLNK or " Direct Cable Connection " ) , it 's very slow , and it 's a whole lot of trouble . I recommend purchasing a low-cost Ethernet or phone-line networking product instead-both are much faster , easier to set up , and will work with ( and between ) many operating systems . Overall recommendation : purchase this cable only if you * must * fileshare with an MS-DOS based system and cannot install a network card .  
2	  The Zune came packaged very nicely . I love it , its easy to use . It was also shipped pretty fast in the mail . Thank you .  
2	  excellent cable for the money . I would purchase it again . Every thing shipped on time and I am happy with this purchase .  
2	  This is a basic HDMI to HDMI cable that does what it is supposed to do . Nothing more and nothing less .  
2	  This one is really a very good camrea , maybe the flagship model in the compact digital camera range of Canon , it makes good pics , it has a pic / image stabelizer , lovely design , 4X zoom like most canons compared to 3X zoon in competetive cameras , and it has many more nice features that were mentioned in previous reviews butt .. the but is not a small one in this case , and these are the kinds of buts that diffrenciate between a good camera and a great one , it is one of the best but not the best , surely not the greatest camera in its segment : 1 ) almost no manual posibilities , you cant " grow " with this camera if you start liking / enjoying photography and want to expand your skills . 2 ) i find the digic II processor thats fitted to most of the canon models nowdays rather limited , although it gives great images , it like its sibelings has many limits and it seems over the hill compared to some of its competetors and the processors they have fitted in thier premium cameras , i have to say that this is one of the main reasons i feel somtimes that canon cameras are overrated . 3 ) the price , this is the biggest problem of this model , its way to high and does not justify the extra 25 % till 40 % percent you pay for other cameras in its premium segment , further more other cameras in its segment offer a larger varity of technical , manual and tecnological features for even two thirds of this cameras price . 4 ) there is also an issue with the mic when filming video , as several reviewers have mentioned . Canon has produced a very good camrea , solved many problems of its predeseccors , dont see this review as a negetive one ! its easy to say whats good about it and honestly it has lots of things going for it and whoever buys it will surely enjoy it , its one of the top 5 camreas in its segment , that means one of the top 5 compact digital cameras out there today , but i can think easily of two , three camreas that do it for less and do it better .  
1	  Hard to read . you have to get down on your knees to see it , if it would work . Look around for better one  
2	  I may buy a few more of these ! They may not be perfect compared to the more expensive binoculars , but hey , these were the right price and they get the job done ! Excellent value . No problems .  
1	  The primary purpose why I bought this device was to connect video game console ( PS2 ) . As soon as I had it ready , I found that it could not be used for that purpose due to a 1 second delay , which is not a big deal with television , but is not suitable for the gaming . I also tried it out just to see how well the device performs . Pluses - Very easy to setup and install - Very easy to use , record and play the recordingsMinuses - The quality of the video was unsatisfactory , somewhat blurry and dark . OK to watch TV once in a while , but absolutely not for HD fans . - Every time I exit the TV mode , it would return the settings to default , meaning that every time I run this , I have to go and change video standard - Not compatible with satellite tuners - No good for video game consoles due to a delayI haven't really tested scheduling of recordings , so I cannot say anything for that . Overall , I say this device is not really a bad one , but I don't think it 's worth the money it 's being sold for .  
2	  Just picked this up for my older desktop and had it installed and running within 5 minutes . I had previously tried a Linksys card but I could not get it to identify my IP address or stay connected . The D-Link software / driver install was much quicker and I don't have any unnecessary programs running in the background slowing my machine down . I swear that my wireless connection is even faster than my wired connection . Perhaps my standard ethernet card needs replacing as well ! For the price , this one is tough to beat !  
1	  The title is simply put in the headline . I bought this battery to replace a dead Uniden BT905 battery . Installed the battery just fine and came back to it a few hours later , smelling & # 34 ; hot & # 34 ; like burnt plastic and electronics . Phone was no longer functional . I would strongly recommend a different choice , probably best just to go to your phone manufacturer 's website and get a battery from them directly .  
2	  This cable links at speeds up to 1000 Mbps and is clearly a good quality cable . The snag-less boots work well and the tabs release very easily which is something that sets it apart from other cables . Even with the ease of release , the tabs are secure when jacked in .  
2	  Extremely useful , and well designed . It even has a place on the back to store it 's cap while in use . Very good value .  
1	  I am in Chicago wher there is a channel 20 broadcasting DTV on channel 21 . I receive all channels with this antenna except channel 21 . Th antenna delivers most of the channels from the same transmitter location as channel 21 , so the aim is correct . It is relatively blind to this channel only . I just had the cables and connections replaced by an installer to make certain that everything else was OK  
2	  I have had this player for a couple of weeks , so I feel I 've used it and familiarized myself with the controls enough to write a review . This is my second MP3 player . I already own a CD based player made by IRiver that is excellent . I bought that player in 2002 and I have not had any problems whatsoever . By 2006 with the market saturated by the more portable hard drive and flash memory based players , I decided to make the switch to something more portable that could also hold a substantial amount of music . I 've always been of the line of thinking that it is a ridiculous thing to carry ones entire record collection with them . My collection however , is quite large . The 20-gigabyte hard drive the Zen Sleek Photo is equipped with was surprisingly a comfortable fit . I used to carry a CD wallet full of Data CDs formatted for my old player but now I 've transferred most of the songs on those discs to the Zen player . The portability of this player is one of its best features . It is small , light and well designed . All of the hard drive based MP3 players currently on the market are made for casual use , but it does seem that this player can stand up to constant use better than it 's counterpart the Ipod . The Zen 's controls are awkward at first , but it does not take long to get used to the vertical touchpad . The touchpad 's sensitivity can be modified by accessing the player options through the main menu . Once songs , albums and playlist have been loaded , it 's a breeze scrolling through the various names to access any song ( or group of songs ) that 's wanted . One of the drawbacks of it 's scaled down simplistic control system is the inability to make playlists , edit or change the order of songs directly from the player . If you want to make any revisions to track information or even change the sequence of a playlist , you must rely on the software that comes bundled . The software , while it 's easy to use , is a taxing application when it 's loaded onto a computer . If you have a newer system with a processor in the 1.5 to 2-gig category you should be fine . If you are like me however ( with a processor of less than 1 gig ) , then it can be a little sluggish . Running this program is similar to starting Musicmatch 's jukebox application . Once the program is running , navigating through it is simple . Even those who are novices to this type of technology will find a user friendly environment that makes it easy to access the content on the computer hard drive , load the player and put it to use . Another one of the player 's best features is it 's battery . This is the thing that is the most dramatic improvement compared to my last player . A 2 hour charge will last at least 12 hours ( it lists as 15-20 ) . When I put this in contrast with my other player 's 4 hour battery time it is significant because once I charge the new player , I generally don't have to charge it again until the next day . The feature that turns the backlight off when it is not in use probably contributes to the long battery life . File types also factor into the equation . MP3 's are the easiest to play , while WMA and WAV files are a little more demanding on the battery . The sound quality is superb . The player has an extensive EQ system that allows users to choose a preset ( ranging from hip hop to classical ) or customize their own settings . The smart sound feature will take all of the distortion out of songs encoded at high ranges and keeps the songs at a general levelness as far as loudness is concerned . This feature does affect the sound quality a little bit , but it can be side stepped almost entirely by turning the volume up a few notches . The headphones included are of average quality . The phones get the job done nicely and are a comfortable fit . I do wish that the padding that covers the ear buds were of a little more quality . I 'll probably be in need of new padding ( or new headphones ) in a month or two . The photo viewer shows crisp ( miniature ) replications of the photos loaded onto it . The quality drop when loaded onto the player is noticeable but not drastic . As a portable viewer , it is a good feature to have and it is the main reason for the player 's color display . The ability to partition a section of the hard drive for storage is also a useful tool . At the moment I just have 512 megabytes set aside to use for school work but you have the option of up to 16 gigabytes . Overall , the ZEN Sleek Photo is an excellent MP3 player , with great features ( microphone , FM radio , limited organizer , photo viewer , drive storage ) . It does have a few functionality issues but these don't warrant any great complaints and usually just require a tad more patience . I 've enjoyed using this player and I would recommend the Zen Sleek Photo to anyone looking to buy a quality player of this class .

2	  fits my Lenovo R-60 perfectly . Provides a bit of padding so it can be carried in a regular backpack or briefcase , yet isn't bulky .  
1	  I read the reviews that many have written about these cables but I thought they were just kidding and may be a one off thing . But turns out if you do not order from Amazon or any trusted third party you are going to get a knockoff . The item that i received was not from Cables To Go and was not Cat 6 cable either . I ordered for 2 14 Feet ( Black Snugless Cables ) from Amamax . I think I am going to pay more attention to the obvious reviews and then decide about products like this . Dont know why Amazon does not have a control on stuff like this . I have asked for a return hopefully it goes smoothly .  
1	  Summary : I hate it . Pros :* The photo output is decent for a multi-function . Not nearly as good as the canon or Epson photo printers , but decent . * The scanned images are good quality . Cons :* The software is awkward , bulky , SLOW , not well thought out and occasionally asks for the installation CD so that it can completely re-install itself . If this were the only con , this alone would be reason to stay away from this printer . * The black only printouts are light . * It 's very noisy * Did I mention slow ? * The small arm that guides photo paper into the unit is flimsy .  
2	  I have always favoured Bose ( and Sony ) for sound . I was going for my first SERIOUS purchase for speakers in December 2000 , at Future Shop in Toronto . A salesman asked me to try the newest Polk Audio bookshelf speaker , and compare it to the 151 's . The dude loves Polk Audio . Polk Audio impressed me some with good sounding small speakers . It spilled out sounds that were a fair score . Not to impress me into buying them . Over to Bose 's 151 Environmental speakers . And I love Bose . The construction , although not a wood or grain , is made of a cool hard-weather-resistant poly structure , in order for it 's outdoor capabilities . It can handle up to a hot 50 C , ( apr . 125 F ) , or dip into the Greenland regions of around , - 22 C ( about 5 F ) . Wow . Winter parties ! And for even indoors , it reall does OVERALL look like a neat speaker . For sound , it punches out a more than decent 80 watts per channel . And since BOSE is renound for it 's realistic natural sound , it more than proved it 's greatness over slightly polky Polk . The 151 's made the music so well delivered , making them sound relaxed , yet strong and natural . Just like they were " breathing " music . You could ' feel ' the sound everywhere . However , ( yeah , I know ) these speakers are better with a subwoofer . Otherwise , you 'll call this review , " correct yet overgenerous " . Polk on the other hand , are better than average .. but with too much push and shove . They sounded like a couple of little loud punks with some manors . I consider my 151 's the boss of 80-120 watt speakers , indoor or out ! And they also come with wall mounts that have a spacer to change angles at the notch of the bracket . A blessing is the reliable 5 YEAR warranty it carries . No extra price for 5 years . All automatic with your purchase . But courtesy of Bose , not your store . So , if you need a good pair of bookshelf , outdoor , or even GREAT movie speakers ( and not just as rear / satellites .. great for front channels too ) , then Bose wants to ask you .. " What would you like to hear ? " BOSE 151 Enviromental Speakers : score - 9/10  
1	  The recorder will record for 2 or 3 hours and at any time stop and give an error msg . Often the recording works fine but when you finalize you get an error . I have tried + R 8x , -R 4X and + R 4X . Some of these black DVD 's were the $ 2.00 last forever variety . When it works it works well but I cannot live with this erractic behavior . I also think the remote is ridiculous with its small buttons and slow response . I plan to return this item .  
2	  I already owned the same router , and I purchased this one for my daughter . Great price on a great product .  
1	  Three days after receiving this cable I noticed some small artifacts around the screen . After investigating the cable I found that the HDMI end of the cable did not fit into my TV 's HDMI port snugly and if the cable was not held up in the TV 's connector no signal would come through . At first I thought it might be a bad HDMI port on my new TV . However , after trying this cable in all three of my HDMI ports and having the exact same issue , I then tested the Mediabridge cable I purchased from Amazon for my DVD player in all of the sockets and it worked perfectly . The other HDMI cables I have all fit snugly into the HDMI sockets on my TV . This cable feels like it 's ready to fall out at any time no matter what socket it 's put in . I 'm going to be returning this cable and replacing it with a higher quality Belkin cable .  
2	  I purchased this 4/3 lens for use on a Leica Digilux . I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this lens . It is a very good performer , and for the price cannot be beat .  
1	  If you are trying to connect your laptop or computer to a TV that only has component inputs and no VGA inputs , this cable WILL NOT WORK . I should have read the reviews before I wasted my money on this . You have to buy a transcoder or converter box instead , which will convert the VGA signal to a component signal . Repeat , under almost NO circumstance will this cable let you view your PC or Laptop on a TV screen . SAVE YOUR MONEY ( Or spend $ 150 + on a transcoder / converter box )  
1	  Just drop this 2005 ancient thing that weighs more than 2 lbs . Adorama sent me this crappy one that doesn't read SD cards , so this camera has that problem after a while , and the LCD screen doesn't have live mode which is a must after Sony A350 . On D5000 Nikon is so slow and really hard to see esp . using 2x teleconverters , macro or any other manual lens with aperture . At this price , go for Samsung which has better acquarium and flower shots than in reviews , Sony with polarizer filter . For sports or nature shots or anything else , D50 is a piece of crap .  
1	  I bought the Champagne speakers and found that the sound is not as good as my $ 50 Yamaha speakers . This sound is not especially sharp or clear and there is a faint muffled noise in the background .  
2	  This is my first MP3 player and it was given to me as a gift . I love it and it 's probably the one I would have bought for myself . I love that I can slip it in my pocket or if I choose to use the neck strap , it 's so light that I don't notice it . Plus , it just looks so cool . The big plus for me was the FM tuner . A couple of drawbacks : The arm band .. Pfft . It completely obscures the controls . The manual was a definite translation . I read it just for kicks . The good thing is that the player is so simple to use that you don't really need the manual . The only other problem I 've had is that the software it comes with is a little flakey . I recommend using Windows Media or Real Player to transfer your songs .  
2	  I am satisfied with the product and the shipping time was less than one week . Price good . No instructions of course . I have been happy with all of my purchases thru amazon .  
1	  This thing was just plain crappy . It was loud , the power plug didn't sit right , and the fact it just had a pair of lame box fans with no ducting meant that if you use this thing on anything but a desk or table , it ; s going to suck up hairs , or your blanket will poke the blades , or one of a number of other bad , noisy things will happen . I had it for a couple weeks before it died a loud , annoying death . Spend the extra couple bucks and get thisAntec USB-Powered Notebook Coolerit 's fantastic , whisper-quiet , amazingly powerful , and has a sealed bottom with intakes in the back and side , so I can use my laptop on my lap  
2	  The product is fantastic ! Not much bigger than a postage stamp , yet with great storage . I use it at the gym to listen to recorded books . Easy to operate , great audio quality . It can be clipped to a sleeve or collar and operated with one finger . Holds hundreds of songs that can be listened to sequentially or randomly . Easy to upload or delete contents . I love it .. but still can't believe it .  
2	  We love the sound . and you are the best , fast service and delivery tks i will give you a # 10  
2	  Wow , the pictures that this camera takes are fantastic ! I 've had it for 8 months and the pictures that it takes are absolutely incredible . Our old digital 's battery would hardly last two pictures , this battery lasts for days with frequent use . You first look at it and you think it 's small , but it zooms in perfectly . It has tons of settings for taking pictures , my personal favorite is the " Sports " setting so that your pictures with proper focusing will never be blurry . Highly reccomended camera !  
2	  This case fits my Seagate GoFlex perfectly . It provides great protection for your portable drives . The only thing I would add to the case would be a wrist strap . The color is nice too .  
1	  My filter arrived dirty , and with a piece of paint stuck to the glass . Considering the extra expense of ordering a supposed high quality item , if I could rate this item a -1 I would .  
2	  Please trust me when I tell you that these speakers are great . The sound from Sony 's SSF-7000 speakers gives my living room a much needed PUNCH ! For under $ 200.00 this is a deal that shouldn't be ignored . I 've built my entertainment center around my Sony PS3 with all Sony products , because I thought it was time to have everything sync together as one unit . The only probblem I had was that one of the speaker cover was damaged at the top , but the speaker was untouched . The covers should be well protected since they'er so flimsy . Still a great purchase . If Sony sends me a replacement cover , i 'll be a Amazon shopper for life . Update January 2013 : I can't believe these speakers sound the way they do . When I slap in a blu-ray disk , these speakers kick like 2 angry mules ! If you live in an apartment like I do , your neighbors are going to love you , ( not ) . I have the new Sony 7.2 a / v reciever but only using the 5.1 setup but will order 2 more Sony speakers in the near future . Music sounds good from these speakers , but the real deal is watching movies with these tower speakers ! Its really like having your own movie theatre . The speakers are tall , slim and looks great enough to be displayed without being overwhelming . I like the fact that they don't need to be cranked up to the max to be heard , even at a low volume they sound impressive . Make sure you have a good reciever to push these bad boys and you'ii come to love these speakers like I do . Check out my other reviews on the Sony items i 've purchased from Amazon , Thank you .  
1	  I have the iGo Juice ^ 70 model PS0055 . This is a three-in-one adapter - AC , vehicle , airplane - that can power and charge your notebook computer . With an optional accessory , you can also charge another mobile electronics device , such as an MP3 player , a cell phone , or a PDA . In other words , the Juice can charge at most two devices : a notebook , plus one other small gadget . Unlike what some other reviews have said , the Juice cannot power / charge more than two things at a time . The Juice comes with 10 tips for a variety of notebook computer brands , from Compaq and HP to Fujitsu to Panasonic . Unfortunately and unforgiveably , no tips is included for the popular Sony and Toshiba notebooks . You can call iGo to request a free Sony - or Toshiba-compatible tip ; whether they 'll actually mail it to you is something I can't verify . ( There doesn't seem to be a way to make the request on their website . ) In addition to the heavy brick-style power converter / transformer ( " adapter " ) , you get an AC cord , a vehicle / airplane combination cord , and a notebook input cord . Let me explain . The AC cord and the auto / air cord bring source power to the Juice brick ; i.e. , you plug one of them into the approriate power outlet and also into the Juice brick . The notebook input cord then goes from the Juice to your notebook , with the correct power tip attached . Be sure to use the correct tip ! Not only is it a question of size and fit , but also polarity and probably also voltage control . Unfortunately , iGo 's tips are poorly made and there are many reports of poor fits . ( Everything in the package is made in China . ) ( Tip : even though the Juice comes with an insert of notebook compatibility charts , be sure to go to the iGo website for updated and correct compatibility check ! The charts have a number of mistakes . For example , it says my Fujitsu C2210 notebook should use Tip 11 , whereas in reality it 's Tip 3 that will work , something that 's correctly stated on the iGo website . ) On the notebook input cord is a connection point for an optional secondary powering system . You can buy one of these on iGo 's website for about $ 30 . With this and an appropriate tip ( another $ 10 , not included in the secondary system ) , you get a secondary adapter , i.e. , an adapter for the Juice adapter ! This secondary adapter then allows you to charge / power your cell phone or PDA or MP3 , one at a time , each with its own corresponding tip . For example , if I were to get a tip for my Sanyo SCP-8100 cell phone , I 'd have to buy an A02 tip , in addition to the secondary system ( which is called " DualPower Accessory for Mobile Electronic Devices " on iGo 's website ) . OK , the Juice works as advertised . It can get hot during operation . My gripe regarding its design is it 's rather bulky , like a brick , and a bit heavy at 7 oz . without the cords . The traveling weight - the brick plus the three cords - weigh at least a whole pound . iGo does give you a cheaply made pouch to store them . Now , if you get the secondary power system in order to charge / power another gadget , the secondary adapter will weigh at least 4 or 5 oz . , excluding its own power cord ! Again : out of box the Juice cannot power any cell phones , PDAs or MP3 players . You must purchase an additional secondary adapter and the right power tips . I simply cannot how some reviewers lied about or omitted this important hard fact about the Juice . My biggest gripe is how expensive this whole thing is . I paid over $ 100 for the Juice and the special tip for my Sharp Actius MM20 ultralight notebook . Then I found out in order to power my Sanyo cell phone or my HP iPaq Pocket PC PDA , I 'd have to buy a secondary adapter plus one tip for each ! The additional costs , and weights , can add up quickly . Not to mention the headaches of managing all the power tips . Let me say this : I regret my purchase of the iGo Juice . The small AC adapter that came with my Sharp Actius MM20 weighs a mere 2 oz . The AC adapter for my Sanyo phone is a mere 1 oz . Together they take up far less space and weigh far less than the Juice brick alone , not to mention I don't even have a secondary iGo adapter yet . Nor do I plan to buy one . ( So right now I can only charge one notebook at a time . I still need to carry the Sanyo and iPaq adapters . ) My advice : don't waste your money , seriously . If you need a vehicle adapter , get a cheap one from Radio Shack or direct from your otebook manufacturer . The airplane plug in the Juice package is useless as most modern airplanes accommodate regular power plugs . The Juice package , for its high price , doesn't even include world outlet adapters , so you can only use the AC cord in the U.S.A very poor value IMHO .  
2	  I have had the Stealth reporter D400 AW for about a year . Extremely well made and needed another bag . I find the 550 as well made and useful as to 400 . This bag easily handels a Canon 100-400 ' L ' series , 70-200mm ' L ' series plus a number of other lenses and a 40D with battery pack . This is a very rugged equipment bag . It 's not a bag to load and carry around all day however . Oh the bags great . But once loaded with quality gear .. it 's HEAVY . For just smaller lenses and camera body , I 'd recommend the Lowepro Slingshot . Very handy and easily carries stuff for a day trip . But the Slingshot won't easily carry the larger ' L ' series lenses . The Stealth Reporter line is highly reommended for Pro 's and semi-pros for getting equipment to and from a shoot .  
2	  I have been using Ridata DVD Media for some time now and I recommend this to every one , whose DVD burner supports Ridata / Ritek DVD media . I have used DVD + R / RW and DVD-R formats and they all worked flawlessly on my PC and DVD player . I must say that I have become big fan of Ridata media .  
1	  i bought these speakers thinking they would be good but to my surprise one speaker arrived at my doorstep broken ! the center part of the speaker , the tweeter had broken off ! i hooked up the speakers to my pioneer cd player NOT a high powered amp , the speaker that arrived broken was blown after about one day of use ! then the other speaker blew the next day ! i did not even play the music loud ! DO NOT BUY THESE SPEAKERS !  
2	  I recently bought this Samsung home theater system and I am quite impressed with it . I went through the other reviews and I totally agree with them and I will try to cover areas that haven't been discussed before . Highlighting some of the cons I found : - Does not support AnyNet + : I bought this system along with a Samsung 50 " Plasma ( picture quality is way better than LCD ) , but to my surprise , the TXQ120 does not support Samsung 's own universal control system , Anynet + ( check it out on Samsung 's web site ) - Does not have enough inputs : In addition to the home theater , I also have an Xbox 360 , a set top box and an HD DVD player ( Toshiba ) . The problem is that the TXQ120 has 1 HDMI in , 1 HDMI out , and 1 composite input and 2 digital audio inputs . I had to do some tricks to get it to work using the audio output from the TV . - USB interface : quite slow and not very intuitive . - The sound isn't as good as expected : at this price level and size of the speakers , I had higher expectations . I placed the unit in a 350 sq . ft room and I don't feel the sound filling the room , and I also don't find the audio effects outrageously good , but overall better than average . Overall , a good home theater system but a bit overpriced and requires a minor update ( Anynet support , some extra inputs like an extra HDMI , etc .. )  
1	  Fist you should know that while sirius advertises you get 120 commercial free music channels65 talk channelssports including all NFLfree online listening for subscriberswhat they dont tell you the online listening is only of the music channels even though they print it too look like you can get all the services online they don't broadcast any sports or talk online . also while they don't have commerials thyte still have DJ 's that come on EVERY 2 or 3 songs and talk about nothing to do with the music usualy to tell you about another channel or another show ( which in my oppinion is still a commercial just for their own service ) not a whole lot more music than fm  
2	  This is the best music player I have used . I have used ipod too . The sound quality is awesome and so is the other features . No wonder people rave about it . For heaven sake leave ipod mania and spend money on this and u will never regret . The other reviewer who cant convert his songs to this device is a real hero . Its just drag and drop and no need to convert . Its better he returned the device .. else he would have spoiled it . GO FOR THIS GREAT PIECE !  
1	  I love the Sound of these headphones but after a year of use . I merely placed them on my head and snap . The plastic used snapped . I agree with many of the reviewer . The sound quality is great , but what good does sound quality do if the phones break with no fault but putting them on and off . I take care of my phones , I don't drop them . Bose needs to make this wrong right and reconstruct the head bridge on these phones . These phones should be taken off the market until Bose corrects this problem . Just count the review on this site alow and 1/3 complain of cheap construction because the headset breaks . It just a matter of time for the others usally a little over a year and the phones self destruct . Just long enough for the warranty to end . You would expect better quality from a company that prides itself on the best .  
2	  Years ago , I had a Zapper . It had an attachment where I could also " Zap " numbers , or stop other unwanted numbers . I thought this one Zapper would do the same . However , there is no attachment . From what I understand , the Zapper will prevent unwanted numbers for the most part , and I can lift the phone receiver for two or three seconds , to prevent other numbers . I tried that and the numbers keep coming through . There must be something that I am not doing right . Otherwise , I believe the Zapper does what it is suppose to do .  
1	  I thought I was upgrading from analog to digital but after seeing the videos I shot indoors I liked the analog better . Very poor and grainy . Also the focus is terrible ! While filming 3 people in a row moving from one to the other the focus would blur then refocus . I filmed my daughter 's ballet recital and could not believe how the auto focus kept bluring then focusing . Very disappointed with this purchase . I guess it 's true what they say . " You get what you pay for " It seems under $ 600.00 doesn't get you much .  
1	  Purchased unit to read compact flash . Upon failed operation , looked closer and saw broken pin in card area . Didn't note * any * resistance when the card was inserted , so it was either broken upon arrival or it bent when the card was slid in the slot with no resistance . In either case , the unit 's far too fragile with compact flash cards and I had to make a return . Sad too , because it looked promising otherwise .  
1	  I did not buy a fax modem card with my new Lenovo Windows 7 work station . I loaded it with memory to run high end business applications . I attached a nice Fujitsu scanner that interface very well . I figured that a fax / modem PCI card would be great . Just scan the pages and launch the fax software and woosh off it goes . Well , not exactly . Comparing it to my 8 year old Canon L170 fax machine the computer modem is like a snail . The time it takes to send a fax via the computer is like quadruple the time , approximately a minute per page . A 6 page fax in 6 minutes , not exactly Olympic speed . Plus keeping a fax line open for 6 minutes is very difficult and often the fax transmission fails . If you want to receive faxes via the fax modem open all the time the computer must stay on 24 hours a day . The card was inexpensive so I am not going to return it . Plus there is some value if I want to send a PDF as a fax and save printing it out and faxing it the conventional way . This problem may be the extra processing that the computer must do to send the fax . I cut the down the scanner resolution to reduce the file size but it did not make much difference . The address book is nice with the system making it easy to pick out frequently used numbers easily but this does not make up for the slow speed . With Windows 7 the instructions clearly state to run the CD software first and then insert the modem / card in an available PCI slot . I have other Trendnet products like fast Ethernet switches that work very well . I think if you still need to send / receive many faxes stay with a good brand fax machine like Canon .  
1	  Note Type M and H xd cards are incompatible with some card readers ! I have a Fuji camera and bought an xd card type M. But it turns out that type M and type H cards are not compatible with all card readers ( even ones that work with regular xd cards ) so I have to use my cable and camera batteries to upload photos from my new card , or purchase a new card reader . Ugh ! Buyer beware !  
1	  My HP laptop got very hot while sitting on my lap . I had to put it on a small board to keep from burning my legs . The computer would get so hot after prolonged use it would shut down ! I purchased the Notepal Cooler and what a difference . The temperature of the laptop without Notepal would reach 151F . With Notepal , the laptop now stays in the 127F-133F range with no more shutdowns . The two fans on the Cooler are very quiet . You won't even know they 're running ! If you have a 17 " laptop you might want to get the new Cooler Master NotePal W1 Notebook Cooler ( R9-NBC-AWAK about $ 45 ) . The widescreen laptop fits perfectly .  
1	  I have over 200 CD on my computer that are in the WMA " Lossless " format . After several emails and finally a long distance call to Creative I find out that they do not support this format and can not help . They said that " maybe " if I gat a Codec from Microsoft that would help , but they could not tell me which one to get . The only reason to buy this product is b / c it is MS compliant and in theory should work better with XP and other applications . However , I have learned it is no more compliant then IPOD . Since this player is not fully MS compliant like they stated I am taking it back and going with the smaller and more ergonomic IPOD . Bottom line buy the IPOD it smaller and better !  
1	  This drum was not packaged very well . I 'm not sure if that was the issue , but I could not use the drum . Had to go out and buy another one !  
1	  The only reason I even gave it one star was that it did turn on . The battery lasts about 1 hour fully charged , which is just sad . I could not communicate with a vessel that was 1 mile from me , which again is sad . Spend a little more money and get a better product .  
1	  It is not really a review of the discs but rather of the entire LightScribe technology . I am new to this technology - just purchased my first Verbatim discs capable to LightScribing . The quality - mainly contrast ( with setting for high contrast ) - is so low that I simply cannot understand how this so imperfect technology has survived for several years . And it takes about 30 min to label one disc .  
2	  Have had TiVo for about 2 and 1/2 years , it brought my time-shifting ( 3 vcrs ) to a new level of convenience . The on-screen abstract of every show you surf over ( so you get to see what 's playing even while on commercial breaks which they all take at the same time ! ) , the ability to see a listing of every show on " right now " or in the immediate future on any channel you choose are great . the pause and rewind enrich the viewing experience whether for political debate or reviewing the beach babes on North Shore or clarifying stepped on dialog on dramas . As to the channel changing hesitation , the fix , to the extent there is one , is to fine tune the communication between the cable box and the TiVo box ( there are encoding options in the set-up menu ) . The hesitation is the " fault " of the cable box having a difficult time decoding the channel change command from TiVo . I am cable box free at the moment and channel changing is instantaneous : that particular concern ( and it IS annoying to experience ) only applies if you have a cable box and with TiVo I have more than enough stuff always ready to watch that I don't need premium channels ( or premium cable bills ! ) . 4 stars ? I 'm about to need my second hard drive replacement ( it 's working 24/7/365 so I understand but it IS a pain ) and while I begrudge the expense ( first was warranty , this one is likely on extended warranty but I had to buy the extension ) I begrudge losing the unit for six weeks or more even more : don't throw away those VCRs ! Even after you 've hooked up the extra to archive shows directly off the TiVo , which frees up space and gives you permanent copies of the shows you really want to save : as with everything TiVo just a click or 2 away , set the VCR to the line-in port coming from the TiVo , hit record and select " record to VCR " from the show 's menu .  
2	  Purchased these at the recommendation of a friend who said " wide angle " binoculars are the way to go for NFL games . I followed his recommendation and these work great - brings you up close to the action at the other end of the field . The wide angle includes the entire O-Line - not just a single player . The swivel style focusing button is a great improvement over the dial focus on my old binoculars - a touch of the button brings you into focus . Very good ! Unit comes with a nice roomy case . Some reviews I read complained of a cheap plastic strap , but someone must of heard and improved on that complaint . The strap is very durable and fits fine . Another convenience is the light weight - no more of the neck tugging downward pressure when you wear the binoculars over your neck . Easy to carry on the hike from the parking lot to the stadium , too , owing to light weight and smaller size than traditional binoculars .  
1	  Is this a joke ? Description says the Airport extreme card has a " new wireless technology called 802.11g " . Big time ripoff , questionable seller for failing yo add that this " new technology " is already quite ancient . Wireless G was surpassed by a newer version of the Airport extreme using a technology called " wireless 802.11N . " If this wireless G card is paired with a wireless N router , you will only get slow wireless G speeds . Great deal though if your goal is to slow your network down . Wireless G is and older and slower technology , buy an N card or adapter .  
2	  I used this in China and works very well . Used it on my cell phone charger , tablet and also computer .  
1	  If you are buying a new MAC do not buy this printer . This printer will not work with OS X Lion 10.7 . The driver is not available from Samsung and the Samsung help desk will not give a date when it will be available . I hope this review will encourage Samsung to develop a driver .  
2	  Purchased for the very occasional viewing of DVD 's - and for playing Jeopardy which we received as a gift . Unit works well , although we had problems with the open / close button on the machine . Amazon was quick to replace it with another . So far , the replaced player is working very nicely . Especially like how compact it is ! For the price , it 's an excellent choice for our needs . Would have rated it 5 stars had we not had the problem with the initial machine .  
1	  This alarm clock has been nothing but trouble for me . First of all , it always is behind on the time and I have to fix the time every two weeks or so since it gets off by 5 to 10 minutes . Second , the first one I bought was defective and the buttons didn't work . I should have taken this as a clue because when I got the second one the buttons worked for about 6 months and then went out and now only some work and only half the time . Third , after a year of use , it no longer plays my iPod , which is the main reason I bought it . I 'd spend money on a higher quality unit since this doesn't work for the basic functions it is used for .  
2	  Does just what it says it would do . I had 1GB of RAM on my emachines desktop even though I somehow thought all along that I had 2gb . anyway , this speeds up my multitasking and multi page web browsing significantly . no hitch in what i 'm doing now .  
1	  The design and sight of this baby are awesome . The battery life is also incredibly awesome . Yet it pains me to have to listen to the same mp3 's over and over and over and over ( you get the point ) again . 32 mb is patheticly pathetic . You will like it for a month and then disregard as some type of trophy of technology . If you want something you could really use and teasure I would reccomend the Archos Jukebox Recorder . ( 6000 mb vs . 32mb ) Just my $ 0.02KaiWhatever is not nailed down , is mine . Whatever I can pry loose .. is not nailed down !  
1	  Ok , I 've had this product installed for nearly a year now and I can't believe I out up with it due to the consistently poor sound quality . No , not poor , HORRIBLE . I 've stuck with it for a few reasons : A ) the factory head unit that came with my ' 03 Subaru Outback sedan was large format and the replacement I had on-hand ( a mid-range Eclipse with rear aux input ) was standard size and I didn't want to have to buy and fit a dash pocket and B ) the weather strip on my car makes a tremendous racket at highway speeds and it obscures any hissing anyhow , but really C ) laziness ; I just got used to working around it . No more ! I went out today and replaced the head unit with the Eclipse and came right back to write this review ( OK , I took a nap first ) . The Eclipse sounds wonderful and doesn't interfere with radio signals ( which I actually don't listen to anyway , but the Scosche pretty much ruined even if I wanted to ) . As I previously mentioned , the audio hiss was terrible which meant that I had to set the Bass really high with the Mid and Treble low just so it didn't sound like an Edison Phono wax cylinder . This is on either frequency setting . I actually disagree with the assessment of some reviewers that this has better sound than an OTA FM transmitter .. it 's MUCH worse in my experience . This was bad enough but I was obviously willing to deal with it until the winter came . I live in upstate Ny and , though this hasn't been a terribly cold winter , the temp has been hovering in the 30 's for a good few months . After I start the car , this piece of junk creates the most awful buzzing noise for at least a few minutes until some mysterious component warms up . To make matters worse , I have to have the stereo on as it doesn't seem to warm up unless it is actually powered . Now , I know what you 're thinking , " BS , this dude obviously didn't wire it correctly . " Not the case . All connections were soldered and the unit was properly grounded to the body ( bare metal to a grounding bolt ) . Additionally , the connections have thermal shrink tubing on them . This thing just blows , period . Bad purchase . Oh , yeah , I forgot that the unit I bought was not the one I was shipped ! It was the same basic unit with different components . Not a big deal , but I definitely had to rei agin my game plan at the zero hour . I 've been thinking of writing this review every morning and cold afternoon for months . Man , it feels good .  
1	  If you want to use this to record or play VHS tapes , DON'T ! Read all the other reviews about the problems people have when tapes get jammed . Panasonic should be ashamed .  
2	  I am not a huge fan of excessive bass in headphones . For me many of the sealed cans offer a less than desirable listening experience . I own a pair of EH-250 's and like them for a few songs then suddenly listening fatigue sets due to the overpowering bass . My EH350 's are better but I absolutely need a sealed set of cans . My perceptions about sealed cans changed the minute I put the HD215 's over my ears . Sound Quality : I immediately noticed how great the soundstage is on these phones . They provide a very expanded sense of spatial placement , especially for sealed cans . This was the first drastic improvement over the midsized cans I own . The next thing I noticed is how well presented all the mid and high frequencies are . These phones provide vocals and acoustic arrangments very desireable traits such as great detail and transient repsonse often missing from cheaper phones . Having said all that , I do have to point out the bass is ever so slightly shy . Litterally a 2db parametric bass adjustment makes it perfect for me and improves the linearity of the phones . Honestly the rated frequency response for my Iriver H320 is 20 .. 20,000hz + / - 2db and usually amps shy the bass away when the volume is turned up because it is the most demanding part of the music . So the adjustment may be for the phones and maybe for the MP3 player either way 2db is perfect . A breif note on the bass ; although less pesent than many phone out there , the extreme amount of detail in the bass reproduction makes some of my other aforementioned phones almost seem muddy . These babies are clean sounding and responsive to very deep bass notes . I love hearing all the hidden detail in the bass and these phones provide me with the deepest growls and transient response for this price range . Construction : These babies are top notch . Designed with professional use in mind they are built tough . I have heard poeple complain about plastic exteriors but honestly plastics are fast becoming superior to metal products in durability , tensile strenghth , and price . I don't use the swivel on the right earpiece but it does function as stated . Comfort : I place listening fatigue over pressure and weight at all times because I have phones I can keep on my head for hours but I am forced to take breaks due to listening fatigue . Next I consider how comfortable they are when properly adjusted for headsize and seal . I have to say these phones shine in both areas . Well designed lightweight and circumural design does wonders for these phones . I often listen for 4 hours or more at a time . Efficiency : Yes they are 32 ohm and they do have a 112db sensitivity rating but they do like a little extra power than other similarly rated pones . If you have a power saving ( lasts more than 10 hours on two AA bateries or worse yet a single AA ) cd or mp3 player you will not get the sound these babies can provide and should look elsewhere . Besides why pay more for the cans than the source which is a common mistake in the marketplace . Remember processing comes from the device NOT the phones , they simply reproduce the signal that is fed into them . Bad source always equals bad sound . A reveiwer below obviosly fell into the misconseption that better phones always provide better sound . Summary : Great dynamics and transient response win out over slightly soft but extremely well defined bass . No listening or comfort fatigue . Great sound attenuation . Exception spatialization and great construction make these phones a very good value . Don't buy if : You want the overemphasized bass other cheaper options will provide . Like the EH250 's or the HD212 's . You don't need a sealed can . there are far more options in open aire full sized designs from Sennheiser that can sound better . You have a cheap portable source . Get an Iriver Hxx series or the slighly less good sounding Ipod or Creative Labs for a portable unit . Something that can truly supply a good 10-12mW at 32ohms . Final thoughts : These cans take about 15-20 hours to break in properly so expect them to sound slightly bright and lacking in the bass at first . Once they break in they are warmer sounding and much better balanced .  
2	  For about a month now , I 've been reading all the reviews for the Digital Rebel . I was finding hard to believe that a camera can be that easy to use . I have a Rebel GII that was pretty easy and I got excellent shots with . I took the plunge and purchased the DRebel and all I can say is WOW ! The camera is quick and relatively quiet . The first time the flash popped up I jumped , but you get used to it . I am replacing an Olympus C-50 , which is an excellent camera . The camera does have some weight to it , but to me that 's a good thing . I like using the viewfinder to take the picture and of course you get to see the results afterwards . The firmware in the camera is very easy to upgrade ( which I already did ) . The software the camera ships with is pretty easy to use . My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a CF card . It should at least come with a small one to get you started immediately .  
1	  This book was overly long , and it seemed like the original premise got lost in the story . Ms . Tartt can certainly write , but I felt the writing took over the story . Certainly the book jacket is misleading . What was the story she was trying to tell ? As others have mentioned , the ending is a non-ending . Was I disappointed .. most definitely !  
1	  I bought my first one used from Amazon back in July and within 2 weeks , the screen died . I ordered another one , only to have the firmware corrupt and whenever I tried to reload the firmware , the player would disconnect from my PC . At first it seemed nice . It had decent sound and a good size of screen , but for all the trouble , it 's not worth the money . Creative doesn't give a long enough warranty . I have a Creative sound card and sound system for my PC which have been wonderful , and my brothers each have a Vision M which has no problems , so I 'm disappointed in the quality . And why is it $ 300 now ? It was only $ 80 when I bought the first two this past summer . There 's no way it 's worth $ 300 , let alone , $ 80 .  
2	  When Amazon wrote and asked me to review this cable , I was almost overcome with joy . It is functioning absolutely perfectly . The only improvement that could be made would be to add some style to it and hire a name designer like Tommy Hilfiger to add some creativity to its appearance and a class name for those want their systems shown in the Museum of Modern Art . I suggest " shocking pink " as the color for a real power cable .  
1	  Described as " brand new . " Was likely reconditioned . Was not to original specifications . We build custom machinery and put a UPS on each machine . These units were scrapped out at the customer location ( export ) and replaced with APC units from authorized distributors . My bad for looking to save a buck .  
1	  PROS * Good looking hardware * Small size ideally suited for travel and handheld use * Unique turn exclusion screen allows you to select multiple roads you want to avoid with ease * Lots of routing options ( including fast car , slow car , pedestrian , & scenic route ) * POI brand icons displays company logos on the map instead of generic POI category icons * Music player supports MP3 , AAC , and WMA audio formats * Relatively long ( 5 hour ) battery life * Includes swappable white and black faceplates * NAVTEQ mapping data ( 2006 maps ) * SiRF 's high performance StarII indoor GPS receiver * Light weight ( 3.9 oz ) * Nicely designed map screenCONS * Poor documentation * Cluttered , complex UI * Very sluggish / slow . Borders on unusable * When entering an address , pressing the " Back " icon takes you back to the main menu rather than the previous menu , and you have to start entering the address all over again * Couldn't find some addresses - quirky address entry system * Small screen size and small text combined with general slowness makes the Pocket LOOX N100 all but impossible to use while driving * Highly reflective screen difficult to see in many lighting conditions * No Text-to-Speech ( GPS doesn't announce actual street names ) * Voice prompts sound strange - like a drunk woman reading a seductive romance novel ( seriously ) * When using the MP3 player while navigating , audio prompts are announced over the music , making them difficult to hear . Some other GPS units pause the music for audio navigation prompts , and then resume music playback . * User interface needs refinement - some tasks are especially frustrating , such as entering a destination address * Voice Regocnition feature more gimmick than useful feature * No BluetoothConclusionI had hoped the Pocket LOOX would become the GPS I travel with - it 's good loox ( sorry , I couldn't help it ) and small size would have made it ideal for bringing it with me on trips and carrying it around in my pocket . Plus , the mp3 player , video player , and video games would have made it an even better travel companion . Fujitsu Siemens Pocket LOOX N100Unfortunately , the Fujitsu Siemens Pocket LOOX N100 ( seriosuly , not only is this the least catchy product name ever , but the unit I reviewed actually included a legal requirement that I refer to the product by it 's full , un-marketing firendly , name in this review ) is ruined by poor performance and its unpolished user interface . The single biggest problem with the Pocket LOOX is the overall slowness of the unit . Using this frustratingly sluggish GPS for any length of time is an exercise in patience . For example , it takes a full minute for the navigation application to load . Entering text is so slow that you constantly double-hit letters because your not sure if the unit registered the first tap . It 's not that any one aspect of using the Pocket LOOX is slow - it 's that EVERY aspect of the Pocket LOOX is slow , from navigating menus to redrawing maps . Performance is so poor that the Pocket LOOX is almost unusable . Then there 's the size issue - the Pocket LOOX has a small screen , so it 's all the more essential that software engineers make intelligent use of the screen . Instead , it feels like Navigon 's software was designed for larger display GPS devices and simply transferred onto the palm-sized Pocket LOOX without any adjustments . The small text is unreadable from the drivers seat ( and almost unreadable even at arms length ) , and the menus feel cluttered . The on-screen keyboard is much too small , and almost impossible to use with normal sized fingers . The screen is also highly reflective , making it difficult to see in many situations . I also had difficulty entering in addresses . Frequently the Pocket LOOX would be unable to find an address until I found an alternate input method , such as entering the street name first , or using a zip code or cross street . Browsing through street names is tedious as you have to scroll one line at a time and wait for the small text box to scroll for each line before you can see the entire street name ( assuming you can find the destination street at all ) . Pocket LOOX ships with NAVTEQ mapping data , but was unable to find addresses or POIs that other NAVTEQ-powered GPS devices find without issue . Pocket LOOX does manage to squeeze in some innovative features , such as Brand Icons , displaying highway road signs , speed limit notification , and many vehicle profile options ( there 's even a " scenic route " profile ) . However , overall the Pocket LOOX is too slow , too complicated , and the text layout is too small . Given the relatively high $ 500 price tag , I also felt the Pocket LOOX should have included Bluetooth and Text-to-Speech . Oh , and did I mention it was slow ?  
1	  This is the worst piece of junk ever . Amazon needs to do some serious product control here . The whiteprotective covering looks like mice have gotten at it . My concern is that the replacement will bethe same . I 've had to almost completely wrap the cord with black electrical tape so I can charge my kindle . Have never seen anything like this .  
1	  This is a SONY Product and you cannot even program in the code for the SONY Blu-Ray Player . What good id this remote ?  
1	  I bought this mouse and it worked for the first two days so I threw the box away . Then it died . I exchanged it , and the replacement never worked out of the box . I am trying to use a PS2 / Serial adapter , which the manual says should work . It doesn't . So now I am stuck with a dead mouse . Stay away from this one .  
1	  I 've had one of these things since February ' 03 and have burned only 7 or 8 CDs . It now crashes , freezing up my machine . Only a complete , pull the plug out of the wall reboot will get me up again . After a long ( 20 minutes ! ) disk restoration , the recovery fails and the CD is permanently unusable . I 've tried this several times . The software , by Roxio , is incredibly annoying . They clearly have no interest in existing user interface research . About me : I have a degree in computer sci . from UC Berkeley , have worked in the software biz for 20 years , and am not intimidated by hardware .  
1	  I bought this for a Canon SD10 to replace the stock battery which had a long and useful life . Right from the start the new battery didn't hold a charge anywhere near as long , and after a few charges it would only take four or five pictures before the low battery warning . I returned it for a new one and am having the same problem with it . Very disappointing . I 'm back to buy a stock Canon battery , which despite having a lower rating ( 790ah versus 1000ah ) performs much better . Beware " equivalent " batteries !  
2	  My favorite gadget is my Clie . It includes camera , mp3 player , and universal remote control . It is very sturdy and takes abuse quite well ( I 've dropped mine several times ) . Pictures are really good and the color display makes Bejeweled even more addicting .  
1	  Just bought a SONY T9 in Tokyo last April 10,2006 ( 7 months ago ) . And suddenly 2 weeks ago , the screen went dim practically can not see anything . The power on / off also not working . All happened at the same time . Try to repair at SONY service station in Shanghai as I am residing there for the moment . Very indifferent customer service staff refuse to repair , despite that I do have a world wide guarantee card and the receipt from the Tokyo shop as well as the complete boxes . The SONY people there are really not helpful at all . Most probably we suspect , they don't want to shoulder the cost for repairing under guarantee from SONY worldwide . It is shameful for such a big name like SONY . Definitely , I will not buy again from SONY . Change to Olympus for the replacement and also cancel my BRAVIA LCD purchase . I do not recommend buying goods from SONY as you might have the same experiences ( poor hardware quality and services ) .  
1	  This did fit the camera , however it didn't last very long . It lasted for about 100 pictures and 2 20-30 second videos .  
1	  It looks just like the old Crosleys but the sound quality isn't good and various features stopped working over the course of its first year . Maybe mine was a lemon ? I 'm not going to buy another to find out .  
2	  I originally purchased the D-Link equivalent and was very disappointed . I moved to the Netgear and I 'm very satisfied up to this point . Once connected , everything ( using the default configuration ) worked like a champ ; all computers and other wireless devices could access the Internet , and the DHCP was already working . I created the necessary drive maps and began to fiddle with the other configuration settings . The first things I noticed that pleased me were that the web interface was very well designed and settings I changed took effect immediately ( such as changing the password ) - this may not sound like a big deal , but that wasn't true for the D-Link equivalent . It is always nice knowing that you are working under the configuration you have set , and not having to wonder if they 've taken effect . Many of the network settings also took effect without having to reboot , which was also nice . Then I logged in and the router offered to search for updated firmware , I said " yes " , it found one , displayed information about it , and installed right from the router-easy as pie . I configured the security , and everything was working great ! I was also especially pleased with the little stand that came with the router , allowing it to stand upright and keep out of the way of other devices . I noticed on my wireless devices throughout the house the the signal seemed to be stronger and more reliable that with the other router I had . Note : I haven't yet tried to use the Super G 108Mbs functionality .  
2	  I am not here to say a single word about the product , just the way Amazon lists reviews for the product . There have been 1,2,43,8,16,32,64 and by the time * YOU * read this who knows how many GB devices sold by Kingston . The reviews Amazon lists are for all of them and this just isn't right . The 1GB unit came out how long ago ? Are the problems some reported with them still applicable to the 8GB units ? The 16GB units , the 32GB units ? You get the idea . It is great to have reviews from end users , but not when the seller lumps 5 year old reviews into reviews for the current product . No matter how good / bad the product was , it may well be 100 % different today .  
1	  I am on my second unit in a 60 day period , the first unit went up in about 22 days . I sent back the first unit and Amazon sent me another free of charge , now the new unit has quit also , I am returning it to amazon which now will cost me more money because , the Stinger is 35 days old and I will have to pay a penalty for returning it after 30 days . I can say I don't want another Stinger because neither one really worked any how . Doug from ocean city md  
2	  The Canon ink is great and the price is fantastic . However , the shipping costs for the products that weigh almost nothing is way too high . Do not think you will save by buying online here . I could have bought locally ( and paid tax ) for cheaper - I guess I 've learned my lesson . It also took some weeks to arrive . For the cost , I would have expected overnight delivery .  
2	  I upgraded from a Nikon D50 to the D80 . I have really enjoyed the extra features that the D80 provides . It is a great camera , a great purchase !  
1	  The cartridge did not work properly-all graphics came out reddish-pink . Tried the product multiple times : same result . The seller is professional and might be worth trying again , but in this instance money was wasted  
2	  Good quality , pretty comfortable . Used on an airplane for the kids - good sound volume . It 's not high-end , but for the price it 's pretty good .  
2	  Popped the top off with a screwdriver and put the SSCat sensor head on . Works just like the original canister but 3x bigger and costs less . Also , the lack of bitterant means that it won't funkify my kitchen every time it goes off .  
2	  The photos produced by this printer move home digital photography into a new realm . They are as good , or better , than 35mm prints . The brilliant vivid saturated colors have to be seen to be appreciated , and they also have an archival coating . The prints are a bit expensive at $ 0.55 each , but since you only print the good ones , and you can modify the image before printing , I think it is worth it . Maybe if everybody buys one the media will get cheaper . It is quite slow but you can batch print . Of course the prints are 4X6 inches maximum , but that is 98 % of what I print . I did have a problem during installation due to a conflict with my HP5550 USB printer . Make sure to turn off the HP printer manager or it won't work . Direct printing from a camera is extremely easy , so you can make prints for friends .  
1	  Like some of the other negative reviews , I couldn't get these to fit well . No matter how much bending and manipulating the ear piece I tried , they just fell out of my ears anytime I moved . Total waste of money .  
2	  I needed an inexpensive set of speakers to use with my MP3 player . I saw these Maxell 's and figured I couldn't go wrong considering the price . I received them , hooked them up and they blew me away . For under 20 bucks I could not believe how good they sound . The flat panel speakers take up very little room on my shelf , the speakers have crisps highs , very good midrange . Voices sound as good as on my expensive big speakers . The little woofer adds a nice bottom end and is really decent considering the size . There 's a wired remote that works OK . The speaker wire is a little cheesy , woofer enclosure pretty lightweight but afer looking a others in this range they are no better . I like these so much I 'm getting a 2nd set for my computer .  
1	  The Panasonic RF-SW70 has a lot of bells and whistles , but the sound quality is about a " C " with the bass turned on , and unpleasantly tinny with the bass turned off . The plastic earphones were uncomfortable and kept popping out of my ears . There 's an annoying beep every time one changes the station . Of all the portable walkabout radios I 've tried , this was the least intuitive / most complicated to use . I had to sit down with the instructions to figure out how to use the bass function . I worked with the instructions for 10 or 15 minutes to try to pre-set some favorite stations , and was still unable to figure out how to do this . Likewise the lap timer was confusing . It 's a stop watch one can have beep every 1 , 5 , or 10 minutes , but I wasn't clear on how to work it . Many people will not need this feature . There 's also a " city function " to receive better reception on FM broadcasts from weaker stations . Ironically , I was able to pull in these stations only when this function was turned off . Other features include :* a secure belt clip * tapered shape for holding in the palm of the hand * light-weight ( 3.6 ounces including headphones ) Overall I was not terribly impressed . With mediocre sound quality and confusing functions , I find other radios to be better buys .  
1	  I tried this from 47th street direct - somehow I thought it broke my body and I went into a panic . I switched to the factory lens and matched the focal length then did an MTF comparison between the two with a 5.4 degree diagonal 10 % - 90 % brightness transition . The MTF curves were proof that the lens was truly junk . Often MTF values at F / 8 dropped to 30 . Wide open the MTF dropped to 18 and was a wavy line . Having evaluated it I returned it and stayed with OLY 's lens , which all things considered isn't that bad . Don't bother with this one - you 'll wonder why things are not working . Perhaps the more expensive sigmas are worth it  
2	  The is the best universal remote controller that I have ever seen . It is very easy to setup and is working shortly after removing it from the box . It uses macros to startup devices and change channel inputs . If for some reason a device didn't respond correctly , there is a " help " touch screen button that you can easliy access the device that needs attention . This doesn't happen but on a rare occasion , but very easy to recover . You can have it setup to sleep , to save battery power , the second you pick it up the screen lites up . It 's worth the price . I have had many different Universal Remotes , this is the best one .  
2	  I can confirm the flat portion of this pens works fairly well for sensor cleaning . Here are some tips : - Always keep the cap on the pen until you 're ready to use it . You do NOT want any dirt or grime getting onto the felt surface before putting it on to your sensor . - Use a bulb blower to remove any large particles from the sensor . Neglecting to do so could result in grit being rubbing into the AA filter in front of the sensor . - Take a test shot of a white piece of paper at small apertures to get an idea of where most of the dust is on the sensor . Remember that the resulting image is flipped meaning that if it shows up at the top of the image , then it 's at the bottom of the sensor . - Gently put felt surface against the sensor . DO NOT PRESS HARD . You want to just barely touch the sensor . Start near the edges of the sensor and sweep side to side . - Take additional test shots to ensure sensor has been cleaned . - When done with pen , put the cap back on and give it a " twist " . This will help to clean the tip for future uses . I have found this method to work fairly well for both full frame and APS-C type sensors .  
2	  I was looking for a good adaptor plug for my trip to india . One has to wrestle with most sockets in India ; and its 220 v so have to be careful . This was a great product , turned out to be pretty heavy duty and easy to use . So I bought a couple !  
1	  I have programmed and reprogrammed this device to watch TV , DVR , DVD with a stereo for sound . I choose the radio signal option instead of the infrared and it DOES NOT WORK with any consistency . My family no longer uses it . I have been on the phone with support at Monster . They are nice but the problems do not get fixed . It works for awhile for some things and then other times it just doesn't turn the volume up , turn the TV off , etc . After about 12 hours of time spent on it over a few days , I have come to hate the thing .  
2	  Fast easy set-up , no problems so far have had it 2 months . Would highly recoommend . Great price at Amazon got an extra 30 dollars off with Amazon visa .  
1	  I have to be honest that when i bought this device , i was excited having read so many great reviews . However , upon receiving it , I started using it and was very disappointed . The player is very slow connecting to your network , and then loses the connection every once in a while just for the heck of it . The user interface is somewhat confusing and is slow to respond to remote commands . Also , the little blue light on the front that indicates network transmission is a very bright blue , thats gets annoying after a few minutes . A piece of electrical tape to cover it is a must . I purchased this to take the place of my XBOX 360 's media playback functions . It was once I recieved this player that I realized just how good the XBOX 360 's media functions were . Save your money , and buy an XBOX 360 .. You wont be disappointed in the XBOX .  
1	  I bought the chill mat when it was on sale .. and yet I still don't feel like I got a deal . The mat IS very loud , but that was of less concern to me than the fact that the USB connector is extremely un-sturdy and became damaged quickly , necessitating the connector to be held down to make the mat work . One handed computing is not my preferred method . Despite these defects , the mat gets the job done , keeping my chronically over heating laptop cool , but I came on Amazon to look for a replacement and ended up leaving this review .  
1	  This will be my 3rd trackball in three years . The design idea is nice , but not as functional as a desktop mouse . The rollerball jumps around , and is hard to select items . 3 years ago , I paid half the price as I paid recently , and I am very dissappointed . I will not buy this product again . They do not last , and they do not work well  
2	  Ok , so recently I stepped on my Earhugger A1000 Action Wrap Headphones . Unfortunately , they sounded good and fit really well . When I went back to BL they were all out . So I tried a pair of RPHS34 headphones by Panasonic ( my review didn't go through and don't feel like writing another one ) . They sound good and fit well but leaked way too much sound . So I ordered a pair of JVC earbuds on Amazon which I will review when they arrive . So on to these Koss P3 earbuds . I didn't buy them . These came with a set of big Koss headphones and since my friend can't stand earbuds , they passed these up to me . Hey , how can I pass down something that 's free ? Since they were really cheap and the reviews for these were bad I expected these to suck but really these are some good earbuds given the low price . I tried these on some of my music and sounded pretty good , not great but much better than others claim . Just with the EQ off these sounded good . The bass is actually pretty rich to me comparing the Sony MDRE828LP and the Earhugger A1000 . These don't provide near as much bass as those that cost much more but do sound good enough for their purchase . Mids sounded fine , But as with most of the cheaper earbuds I noticed a bit much in the 200-500k range . These also provide a good lcean sound to them , you don't hear fantastic detail but you can hear most of which comes out of your tunes . Overall , above average sound quality . Not excelling in anything but not failing in anything . I 've also heard that these are too big . Yes , they are larger than most , but with the provided pads on them they fit my rather SMALL ears just fine . These aren't for running or excercising , if you are looking for something on that matter you may want to pick up the Koss KSC22 or the Sony MDRJ10 . These don't fall out when walking but any vigorous activity will just not work with these headphones . One thing you MUST know is about the lifetime warranty . Yes , they come with the lifetime warranty . But unless you bought these in the pack with the big headphones , the warranty is pretty useless since you have ot send in five bucks to get them repair . Somewhat a ripoff if you look at the price listing for these seperately . Overall , a good middle of the road chose for those looking for somethnig with good sound and are comfortable and don't want to spend a ton . They are no where near the best headphones you can buy , nor are they the best sub ten , but for a cheap and well suitable replacement for your iPod or other portable player , these are it . 4 stars .  
1	  We purchased and set up this system 1/3/06 . It is sleek and the sound was fantastic . However 31 days later the subwoofer fan began making an awful noise . The warranty choices were send it to N.J. or drive it 100 miles round trip for repair . We drove it 100 miles for repair . After 20 days they advised they couldn't fix it even after installing a new fan . Another 100 mile round trip to pick it up . On 3/2/06 we shipped the subwoofer to N.J. and got it back on 4/5/06 . By 6/12/06 the subwoofer fan had stopped intermittantly many times and with it all sound from the speakers . We again drove 100 miles and returned the whole home theater system for credit .  
2	  Great product - I have both frequencies for this product family . Check out my review of this system using the 418 mhz . frequency . - I can't recommend this product more highly .  
1	  There was a picture of one a little further down the page and a special price if the second one was bought . I was not happy with the second one that I got . The picture of the first one was showed as the same for the second but in fact was not . I bought on the idea that the second one would be the same as the first but it was not and I did not like the second one and probably will not use it or order anything again from Amazon because of this fact . The picture shown here is the one I liked but not like the second one .  
2	  great backpack , holds one camera with attachments well , if you need to put in a second camera it needs to have a small lens , or remove it and use a cap . would buy another if i needed it  
1	  Had I not destroyed the product I would request my money back . Terrible , impossible to use . I have receipt no product , when I removed it after trying frustatratingly to use it , it was inadvertantly thrown out . I would never buy this productWASTE OF TIME MONEY EFFORT  
1	  After reading all the reviews and owning this product for 2 months , I feel that I didn't do a good buy . The unit overall is satisfying , but the problem starts coming after you come out of a underground garage or once you lost signal . The system never aquires the signal and I had to turn it off and on to get the sigals back . This becomes very critical especially if you come out of the covered garages and directly on roads and have no freaking idea about direction . The system would useless as you will taking rounds and rounds of the block till you get satellite signal .. big big flaw ..  
2	  I am saving a lot of money by learning how to take professional photographs of my son instead of paying a " professional " and spending a load of money on half-decent pictures . This camera is definitely paying for itself and I 'll be looking into purchasing lenses in the future as my skills and knowledge grow .  
1	  I purchased this card because I take a number of speed shots and , while my camera can hold them in memory for a period of time until they are written to disk , I periodically fill that memory as well . As a result I wanted to get a fast card compatible with my camera . The specs for class 4 memory cards go up to 15MB per second , while the ones for 6 cards go up to 20MBps . The packaging claims 16MBps meaning that this only barely gets into the class 6 range . This would be more than adequate for most things , but when I am taking pictures of my daughter 's rugby team in sport mode , I want them to be written to the card as fast as possible , I know that the card speed is just one of a number of things that go into the actual write speed , but this is the one that I can easily change . Like I said , for most things , this card would be perfectly acceptable and the price is pretty good . It just wasn't what I wanted / needed .  
2	  I was extremely disappointed when I recently lost my MDR NC11 's that i had been using for the better part of 4 years . I thought that they really blocked out a large amount of outside noise , but the fit wasn't the greatest as they would fall out of my ears pretty often ( I used the largest earpieces available ) . I searched in vain all over the ' net and finally ended my search by contacting Sony . The agent offered to sell me a refurbished pair of the NC22 's for about the same price that Amazon was offering for a NEW pair . When I received the NC22 's I really liked that the noise cancelling module had been updated into a more compact unit . The fit and style of earpieces has been tremendously improved . However , the NC22 's are lacking the volume controls found on the NC11 's . Which brings me to my only real gripe about the NC22 's . While riding on the city bus , I could actually hear some of the conversations of the other passengers with the volume at the midpoint . That never happened with my NC11 's ! I would recommend these headphones to anyone , but they must understand that the NC22 's will not block out all noise .  
1	  Maybe this lens is great , but Amazon does not indicate that the VAD-RA adaptor is needed to attach it - and that is currently unavailable .  
2	  I am able to carry a Canon 5D with a 70-200 zoom lens attached ( after removing the devider in the upper compartment ) a wide angle zoom , a 100mm macro , flash , and a 2x extender in the center area . My 15 in Mac Pro fits in the computer area with the camera equipment in place . I have even found a way to attach my tripod . The other two compartments on the sides , are roomy enough to hold just about everything else . Even with all this equioment , it is a small enough size to fit on my 5'5 ' back .  
1	  Pros for the 2TB LaCie external drive ? When working it is quiet . And , when under warranty , they happily repair it . I know , because the one I bought has crashed twice and had to be sent back . It is back now , fixed again , but I don't trust it enough to put any more data on it .  
2	  This product worked perfectly for me ! When buying just be careful to buy the original products as generic products might cause some problems .  
1	  I ordered and paid for 2 SILVER speakers . Your agent CCV Sales delivered the cheaper BLACK SPEAKERS to my freight forwarding office . I don't want the black pBIC America Venturi DV64 2-Way Tower Speaker , Silver ( Single ) [ [ ASIuN : B00012F7DM BIC America Venturi DV64 2-Way Tower Speaker , Silver ( Single ) ] ] air . Please rectify the situation urgently . Until I receive the product I paid for , I 'll give the product a token 2 rating .  
1	  My G5 can see the UPS as attached through the USB port but the downloaded software will not recognize the UPS unit . Had to send it back because it is functioning only as an expensive surge protector .  
1	  Three big disappointments . Biggest is the viewing angle is WAY too wide . It darkens at 45 degrees , but you can still clearly see what someone 's up to , even if it 's * kind of * harder to read precise text . It doesn't blacken until your near a 90 degree viewing angle . Pretty lame . Also , though it 's " matte " it 's a lot more reflective than a regular LCD flat screen . Maybe it 's less than an old glassy CRT , but the reflectivity is terrible compared to an LCD . You can actually make out your own face and highlights in the screen , even highlights coming from a side window ( which I was hoping would be reduced by the microlouvre , not increased ) . Bright environments are 5 times harder to work in than they would be with a regular LCD screen . And lastly , looking at it straight in , it darkens the screen enough to be distracting and eye-straining . So it 's the worse of both worlds - it darkens too much for the user , and not enough at odd angles . The method for sticking the frameless kind on clutters your screen with cheesy plastic adhesive disks . Plus , it 's pretty expensive for a sheet of plastic . Wait until the tech gets better . Or decent , at least .  
1	  After following startup directions exactly , charging for the requisite 6 hours , using the Creative software installed on my computer , my 4GB Creative Zen Plus froze repeatedly during playback . Today , when trying to shut it down , the entire device froze . Tried to restart it , followed the steps to reset it .. no luck . Now , I can't even get it to turn back on and there was power left in the battery . Am returning to Amazon with regret and will look for a different kind of player . Also , a note to other potential buyers , the black player ends up getting fingerprints all over it and looking generally greasy from the oils or lotion on your hand .  
1	  This hub is an expensive hub that fits well and looks good , but because it has no power , it isn't very useful . You need power for USB devices , in particular , or many of them won't work . It 's OK for a printer or Flash memory stick , but not so good for a keyboard , mouse , iPod , camera , or many of the other devices that power up via USB ports , when plugged in . Worse , the one I bought only lasted 2 years before it failed or burned out ! ? There are better products and a POWERED USB HUB is worth the extra money . This is my 3rd Belkin USB hub and I have not had much better luck with the other two . They make nice cables , but got cheap on the USB hub design .  
1	  I bought one of these for my mother-in-law . She has a Windows XP machine ( fully patched ) so I thought it would be an easy installation . I was very mistaken . The software that you must install on your computer to transfer pictures to the key chain is poorly written and the installation manual is out of date and doesn't work for the software that ships with the key chain . If you follow the instructions , you 'll get an error and the software won't work . If you follow the installation process that you use for most other software , it will not work . I finally found the correct information after googling the name and model number of the product . It took over an hour and five attempts at loading the software before I could get it to " work " . If you bought this product and want it to work , I have the following advice : 1 ) Google for the updated installation instructions2 ) Reboot a lot . After you install the software , reboot your computer before trying to start the software program . When in doubt , reboot again . If the software doesn't install , don't bother trying to repair it . Uninstall the software . Reboot . Install software . Reboot . Try to open software . 3 ) If you bought this and haven't opened the package , return it for a refund . If you get it to work ( and that 's a big IF , if you google this product you 'll see many people complaining about it ) , the picture is pretty good considering the size of the screen and the price of the keychain .  
1	  Yea , it is cheap , but is cheap worth it when you can't get the thing to work ? The instruction manual is an absolute piece of crap , and I quote , " Power save mode shuts it down automatically if in the set time no key is pressed and player is stopped . " Yea , okay . I have a Master 's Degree . Guess what my job is - I 'm a systems analyst and write software and manuals for using software . I 'd be embarrassed to even work for this company . I spent quite a while before I realized that the couple of songs I loaded had some sort of format error and wouldn't play . Then I reloaded some other tracks , and they would play , but only for a few seconds . I tried to make this thing work and tried to understand the manual for over an hour , and finally gave up and decided to go to the website . Well , the website has NO information , but you have to click about 5 times to actually get to the point where it tells you there is no information . And worse , this model isn't even listed . So , next step ? Call the tech support number . It was answered almost immediately . ( Man , was I surprised ! ) Then I got transferred to a recording that told me to go to the " Resource Library " on the website . Well , there IS no resource library on the website . So I called back , listened to the recording again which also said , " We 're experiencing a high rate of calls ( I 'm not surprised ) , and leave your name and phone number and we 'll call you back . " I foolishly left my name and number . They 'll probably call me at midnight . [ .. ]  
1	  We tried for several days to get the nero software to operate with our dell laptop . We updated , filled out forms , read the reviews to get hints - nothing worked . It would play the sound ok , but the picture was a bunch of colored lines - ie , no picture . It was a hassle and I finally returned it . The problem was the included nero software , not the hardware - go figure .  
1	  It worked at first but the connection kept dropping . Then every time you try to open the wizard it flashes on the screen for a second and disappears . You can't get the wizard to stay on screen for more than a second so can't change any settings . A total waste of time and money - don't bother with it .  
1	  You can't even change an ink cartridge without the LCD screen ! All I get when I turn on the printer is the BIG FAT red error light ! Just in time to not be able to print the Christmas cards .. Don't think I 'll be buying another Epson .  
2	  We are very pleased with this purchase . Can see far more than we " should " see in our neighborhood . Can't wait to use them at the beach , for bird watching and during football games . One of my best purchases during the holidays .  
1	  Photograph shows 1 spindle pack of 50 disks . That 's not what you get . You will receive 1 single disk . Mine arrived damaged .  
2	  I used this earlier version of the sony " Psyc " walkman a LOT while it was still working . It lasted nearly a year with no problems . Then my dog jumped up at me unexpectedly and got her claws caught in the wires . The walkman smashed down onto the floor . The buttons on the player itself stopped responding . Fortunately I could still use the so-called " Remote control " . But then I snagged the wire on a doorknob and destroyed that as well . I think I would pay extra to have a wireless version of this product .  
2	  Ended up putting it indoors .. because I 'm lazy , and I still get all the over the air channels I need . Reasonably priced and gives me infinitely better reception .  
2	  I bought this for my new Canon HF100 . And I found out that its too big . But it was not a problem . I put my Canon A610 in the bag together . I liked it because I put all the cables there .  
1	  Tried these for about 2 minutes , then boxed them up . Apparently , Audio-Technica doesn't realize that most people 's ears aren't flat against their heads . With no pivot capability in the vertical axis , these phones are held away from the front of your ear , while pushing excessively on the back part . Not comfortable at all . Don't waste your time ordering these .  
2	  I have tried in the past to use on-ear headphones , but my hair covers my ears , and it doesn't really work . These clip-ons seemed like a solution ( IEMs get uncomfortable after a while and block out all outside sounds , which I don't always want ) . Looks : god , if these aren't the best looking pair of headphones this side of 200 bucks . Granted , I feel obliged to preserve their brushed-aluminum beauty to the extent that I will only store them in the fussy ( but high-quality ) case that comes with them . Even the corrugated-plastic packaging was pretty . Sound : my only other pair of phones are Klipsch Custom 2 IEMs , which are fantastic , and at half the price , I expected nothing like the sound that comes from the ATH-EM7s , which are pretty damn good , and as good as it will get for $ 50 . Besides on-the-go listening , these phones are great for when you just want to listen to music loud and don't want to " appreciate " so much as " rock out " ( which can be a painful experience with IEMs ) . Comfort : finding the right position for the earpieces takes some time ( but not nearly as long as it did for my Klipschs ) , but once you do , there is a significant amount of leeway in the comfort zone , and they will stay comfortable for a long time . I only hit the comfort wall after wearing them for hours on end multiple days in a row . Ergonomics : the cord can be a hassle ; it 's heavier , and all the weight rests on one ear , which can irritate it . It is also longer than necessary , I think , but makes sense if you listen to music from your computer often , instead of a portable player . Quality : it 's made of solid metal with some rubber bits , I doubt the feel could be any classier than it already is . The cord has a habit of twisting around itself , but is effectively tangle-proof , and seems sturdy . A bonus : one of the screws came loose the other day , and the unit attached to the earpieces was jiggling ; I took out an Allen key and tightened it . Power to the people !  
2	  I 've been using this cable for a year . It snaps into place just fine for me and has worked without problem , even after 2 moves .  
2	  I have been using this printer / all in one for about two months now and it is great . It prints , copies , and scans with great precision . I was suprised when I got it at how big it was , but it does not really bother me now . If you are looking for a compact all in one , this is not for you . I have it sitting on a file cabinet and it hangs over the sides .  
1	  I 'm a mom of six kids . I 'm a cheapskate . I bought this because it was seemingly such a good deal . We don't have alot of money to throw around , and this was really my one chance to upgrade . I 'm so disappointed . The on light stopped working within weeks . the dial stopped working shortly after that . Now , less than a year after purchasing it , the thing doesn't work at all . My husband is really handy with wiring things up , and he can't even get this piece of junk to work . DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID ! Spend a little more for a brand you can trust !  
1	  It 's a real shame that one has to go out and buy these suction cups after spending several hundred dollars on the Nuvi . Yet , the cubs quickly become fused to the windshield ( no matter what season ) , and if removed often , they quickly lose their stick . Thus , if you want to move the Nuvi between cars ( the only advantage over having a built-in GPS system ) , then you must buy extra cups for each car . I found Garmin impossible to contact !  
2	  This product worked as I expected . I was without Sirius for a couple months & rolled the dice purchasing this item hoping the tuner was my solution . I installed it myself which was super easy , only 2 cables : antenna & stereo connection . Called Sirius to switch serial # ' s & I was a happy listener within a few minutes .  
2	  The charger works great . It is small & permanently connected to car - just plug in an electrical cord . BUT the cords that connect to battery are too short . There was no space within the cord length . Had to put on my own cords .  
1	  The way carrier was described appeared just right for my needs . When item arrived , the only person it would fit in my family was my 7 year old son , who had no idea what it was and didn't want anything to do with it . Misleading advertisements do no one any good especially merchants pushing things like this .  
2	  These HDMI Cables are fantastic ! I don't know why people buy those expensive cables at electronic stores for $ 30.00 to $ 80.00 when they are of no better quality that I can see .. Efforcity sent those cables to me in a very timely manner , I recommend them highly ..  
1	  This is a nice unit except it needs a shroud to keep some glare away from the screen so that you can see while using it outside .  
1	  seemed like a great product until I went through airport security at Reagan Airport . Set off explosives alarm twice , detained until they narrowed it down to the pen .. I got on the plane finally .. they kept the pen .  
1	  Saw a deal for 48 batteries so I wanted to give it a try and the price is same as 48 Kirland AA battery . I was very skeptical about this battery but I am not so disappointed . I borrowed a battery tester from kid 's science project : consist of 1kohm load and 4 small light bulbs ( will uploaded picture ) . I tested this battery vs Kirland and the result is shocking : - Sony Stemina , exp 2017 : lasted 20 mins - Kirkland , exp 2016 : lasted 2 hours .  
1	  I 'm a long-time Palm user ( love ' em ) , and liked the looks and feel of the Visor Edge . Unfortunately , recharging the battery has been a problem , and [ money ] is too much to pay for a disposable handheld that works for two weeks . I had to perform a hard reset to get it to charge the day I brought it home , and when I set it up for Mom as a gift nothing , I mean nothing , would get it to charge . Soft reset , hard reset , even an in-the-cradle reset , nothing works . .. Quality control just seems to be real problem for Handspring . I won't be buying another one . Getting Mom a Smartphone !  
2	  I received this product promptly from the vendor . As other reviewers indicated , the service from AEEC was outstanding . I connected the unit to my Dell laptop running Windows 7 ; it promptly powered up and loaded the necessary software . In less than a minute after I connected , I was able to open files on my Zip 100 . Very happy with both the unit and AEEC .  
2	  I bought this printer for my son-in-law . He wanted a wireless printer , and pleased with the product .  
2	  This case is a great , simple pouch for Sirius Universal port receivers . I own the Sportster 5 and it fits snugly into the single-pouch case . The seems are stitched well and seem sturdy . The inside lining is soft enough so that it doesn't scratch the screen of your receiver . The case is also stiff enough to help protect your receiver in case you place it inside luggage or a larger carrying case . THERE IS NO SEPARATE COMPARTMENT FOR THE REMOTE . In fact , I cannot see the remote fitting in with a Sportster 4 or 5 , only with a slimmer model like the Starmate . Overall , great product for the price . As long as it protects my receiver from the house to the car to the office , I am ecstatic !  
1	  This product 's problem , is that the maps are obsolete , and no technical support reachable . Errors , in directing to routes 25 % too long compared to Mapquest , or Mapgoogle . Not possible to get the maps update . Cheaper in price , cheaper in value  
1	  First , the camera does look much more professional then the other consumer cameras . The software that comes with it and the ability to save to the SD card are also great .. but after a few weeks of use the pan features inexplicably stopped working . The effort to get it repaired / replaced was such that we ended up not even bothering and just repositioned to get the best view from a fixed location .  
1	  I concur with other posters , this HDMI cable quit working after a few months . Had audio , but the video was completely scrambled . Double checked connections , and if cable was " wiggled " just right , the picture would come back . Replaced with another HDMI cable and things work just fine now . In this case , you DO get what you pay for .  
2	  I 've never written a review for any of the many items that I have purchased from [ .. ] , but I just had to write a review for this one . All I can say is " wow ! " I 'm not sure why I waited so long to get a good subwoofer for my stereo system . The low-end music reproduction for music AND movies is OUTSTANDING ! I am using Monster XP stranded speaker wire , so I can't comment on the sound quality with the speaker wire that came with the unit . Be sure to experiment with different amplification levels and cut-off frequencies ( adjustable on the unit ) .  
2	  If you 're looking for a way to plug your PS3 ( or other HDMI out video console ) to an HDCP capable DVI monitor look no further . Note however that DVI does not carry audio signals , so you 'll be gaming without sound regardless of if the monitor has speakers or not . If your monitor does not have HDCP capabilities it will not function with a game system that requires it . It 's not a cable issue , it 's a monitor issue . Good quality works @ 1080p without any hickups so 5 * ' s from me , especially for the cheap price :)  
2	  This backpack is great ! It is very spacious even with the laptop inside .. it has numerous pockets to store almost everything .. it can carry your computer with numerous thick books and they still fit ! The revolutionary front zipper opens vertically so you can access or store your books very easy ! Also the computer compartment has padding giving extra protection against shocks and water ! also the padding do not go all the way to the bottom of the bag .. this is great because when you put the bag on the ground or in any surface your computer will not hit it ! In addition , you got LIFETIME WARRANTY ! If by some reason your bag breaks , Targus will replace it NO QUESTIONS ASKED ! The only thing you need to do is call them and mail it ! And you will get a brand new one ! Finally this product is great I have been using mine for the last 4 years ! And it still like new ! It is worth your money because you will not have to buy any other computer backpack ! It will last forever !  
1	  If you like ink leaking and decorating your printer and desktop , by all means , buy it !  
2	  Listen People I just bought this tv and its a great tv . Its clear and it has good sound and everything . So people By this one if your looking for a good 32 inch tv with clarity and great sounding crisp sound . Trust me on this .. You wont regret it !  
2	  This is a great laptop carrying case . I was amazed at how many items this case can accomodate . There is padding inside which helps in shock absorption and you can easily store your removeable drives , CD ROMs , software manuals , and magazines in the pouches . It also has two " feet " for lack of a better term that prevent the case from falling when you place it on the floor . What 's even better is that this case is half the price of other similar cases that I 've been looking at on the net and in retail stores . A laptop carrying case is a MUST for people who have laptops and this case is the best bang for your buck !  
1	  I bought this tripod with the intention of using it for both still photography and video . Its head is truly fluid moving , unlike many other tripods on the market . However , the pluses end there . The construction is rather flimsy , and is not best suited for outdoor conditions . Do not use this tripod for still photographs ; one cannot rotate the head vertically , extremely limiting is usefulness . As a matter of fact , after about a month of ownership , one of the rubber pegs on the leg fell off , and now it does not attach on securely . Not only that though , is that the grip that allows you to move the head fell off , rendering the tripod useless . For $ 85 there are many more higher quality tripods that I would have bought . This tripod in reality is worth about $ 35 . I will return this product , expect a refund , and go visit a real camera store to actually try out the tripod before purchasing online .  
2	  This is an awesome thing to have ! No more running to the camera to set the timer , missing it , or having to wait forever for it to go off ! I set my camera up , get everything ready and click my remote - I have my picture ! So simple !  
2	  This device does everything I hoped for-print , copy , scan , fax . It is simple to set up and operate . The price is reasonable . All in all , excellent .  
1	  This is a terrible keyboard . I have always used Microsoft keyboards in the past , but this one is not typical of their normally great design . The space bar is very stiff and it hasn't gotten any better after 4 months of use . I am throwing it out and buying a competitors product .  
2	  The battery was exactly as described and delivered promptly . I would repeat this purchase without hesitation .  
1	  I purchased four of these for Christmas , and 3 of the 4 tested so far do not work out of the box .. the displays are gray and washed out , and the units only work when plugged in . I will be returning all of the units purchased due to this experience .. it 's a shame to give gifts that don't work ! Save your money and get one from an electronics store where you can test the unit before purchasing as problems with many of the digital photo key chains seem to be widespread .  
1	  Just purchased these as a birthday gift . Unpacked them and the set looks great . Went to connect the left speaker wire to the left red speaker clips on the subwoofer ; the red tab slips out , and the spring goes inside the subwoofer ! Nice ! These are going back to Best Buy !  
1	  Its cheap and it does the job but its not very durable and isn't comfortable . I 've been using it for 3-4 months now and its starting to have static when your move the jack .  
1	  I am a fan of Bose and their quality sound systems - or at least I was so far . The 3-2-1 GSX is a great idea and the sound is very good . But the box has so many glitches that it is extremely frustrating . The biggest problem is that DVDs tend to freeze or stop playing at the slightest imperfection . We rent DVDs from Blockbusters and almost never had a problem on our old DVD player . Really bad discs would cause some image distortion or strange effects on the screen but they would normally recover once over the bad spot and never freeze up . The Bose has a hair trigger sensitivity to the slightest imperfection on the DVD ( and which rentals don't have a small scratch or dirt ) . The Bose will simply stop playing , display a message ( " can't read DVD " ) and stop . All tricks trying to fast forward or somehow skip that spot fail . Imagine you are in the middle of a thriller ! In all such cases we played the same DVD in our old player without any problem . I am in the high tech business and used to systematic fault isolation . So I took one disc that froze the Bose ( in that case it did not even eject the DVD and I had to recycle the power ) to the store where I bought the Bose and tried it on other high end players . It worked fine in all cases and got over the trouble spot . The I played it in the top end Bose Lifestyle system . It jammed for a while ( also very sensitive ) but it recovered . I had a lot of interaction with Bose support on this . They sent me a software update CD which made no noticeable difference . The dealer just says such a high quality system is very sensitive to disc defects . That 's balloney , 80 % of all rentals from Blockbuster freeze the system . I have given up having Bose resolve the problem since there is an obvious flaw in the DVD reader and they don't admit to it . I am now buying another DVD player to add to the system since I am tired of the frustrations with the 3-2-1 GSX . If you have a choice , don't buy this sytem .  
1	  I used it once and when I went to recharge my cell phone in Paris it didn't work at all causing me to have to call the states with my credit card and costing a small fortune - Horrible product !  
1	  I followed the advice of another reviewer - I installed the card and expected WIndows to find drivers . Win-7 ( 32bit ) did not recognize the card as anything . It did not look for drivers . So , I tried the install disk . It crashed my system - badly . Took some extreme measures just to make my system start . When it did , a message said take the new unknown device out of the computer . Bottom line .. It does not seem to me it is compatible with Win-7 . The box says it works with Vista and XP . It does not mention Win-7 . I returned it . ( I appreaciate Amazon 's customer-friendly return process ! )  
1	  FROM THE FIRST SECOND THIS ITEM DIDN'T WORK . YOU HAD TO CONSTANTLY REBOOT IT TO GET CONNECTED . THE TECH SUPPORT ( AFTER 3 HOURS ) SAID IT WAS DEFECTIVE AND I SHOULD EXCHANGE IT . WHY WOULD I WANT ANOTHER PIECE OF JUNK . I RETURNED IT AS FAST AS I COULD AND GOT A BELKIN . NO PROBLEMS WITH IT . WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS MANUFACTURE AGAIN .  
2	  I wanted to put my workstation inside the office furniture , which required a longer cable than the supplied one with my LCD . This is way inexpensive , built well and shipped for free to my door ? It would have cost me more in gas to head to the local super electronics store where I would have been bent over ..  
2	  I can connect my TV to my laptop easily with this cord ! The sound and picture are great . Also , I can keep my laptop close so I can easily change the video .  
1	  The body is capable of producing great quality , razor sharp images . Sadly the same quality does not extend to the standard 18-55 kit lens , either mechanically or optically . For example .. - The inner lens tube wobbles all over the place , which makes you wonder what is actually holding it in position . - Accurate manual focusing is impossible due to the amazingly poor design and build . - The lens mount is plastic . - The optics are shockingly poor . Don't expect sharp images , esp at the tele end . If you compare the optical performance of this lens to the Nikon std 18-55 kit lens , you could be forgiven for thinking that Canon are having a bit of a laugh . You can make up your own mind if you check out the " Reviews " section of the Photozone site ( comes up via any of the search engines ) . Try opening two web browser sessions and size them down width ways so you can compare the two lenses side by side . I think you 'll be shocked at what you see . So why does Canon ship such a poor lens as standard with this body ? Beats me - its reputation is widely reported in mags and online . The sooner Canon discontinue the std 18-55 lens the better - it 's absolute pap and has no place on a current day DSLR . My recommendation to anyone thinking of buying this camera is to buy the body and choose the lens separately . If you must have a Canon lens then the IS version of the 18-55 is infinitely better than the std ( non-IS ) 18-55 kit lens ( in terms of the image quality it delivers anyway - mechanically it 's not much better ) . Or , if you don't mind going down the third party lens route , you could opt for the Tamron 17-50 F2.8 - a cracking lens that really does justice to the superb quality and design of the body . Which to choose ? The Canon IS 18-55 is cheaper , while the Tamron 17-50 is faster and significantly better in terms of image quality ( sharper into the image corners and sharper at the tele end too ) . Happy hunting . :-)  
1	  I bought this unit thinking it would solve my travel charging needs . Wrong . I have tried three Sony OEM batteries and the charge light comes on but doesn't charge . I have bought the Sony travel charger since . Wish I had done this first and saved the $ 40 for the Digipower paper weight .  
2	  This camera was so great that I ended up buying another one as a gift . It 's a all in one . There are tons of attachments and it 's great that I can have a video and digital camera all in one . If I run out of disks , I can always through the pictures or video on my memory chip . Amazon has the lowest price on it by far .  
2	  I 've been looking for a camera that doesn't produce blurry pictures , takes FAST pictures , & reduces red-eye , and this camera meets all my expectations and beyond ! I 'm not a professional photographer , I just like to take pictures especially of my kids and this camera is perfect for my needs . It is very user friendly especially if you 've owned a canon digital camera before . I replaced the canon powershot A520 because it was soo slow and took too many blurry pictures and lots of red-eyes . The rebel is so much better and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to take pictures .  
2	  This is a good buy and very quick delivery of this item . Thanks !  
1	  I can't really review the camping stove , because I didn't receive the stove . I did receive a shipment , but it was a kids ' camping gear set instead of a camping stove . Since I needed the present quickly and it went along with the theme of our gifts to our kids ( It was a camping gear theme for CHRISTmas - both adults and children ) , I settled for it . What I received is okay but I was definitly disappointed . Since I decided to " settle " for what was received , I did not contact you ; but since you asked - I 'm informing you of the situation . Thank you , - mendi holt  
1	  I bought the headset to be able to enjoy surround sound while playing my favorite game Americas Army on my Laptop . I got it to work ONCE ! It was awsome ! Great sound , I was able to tell exactly where shots or voices were coming from . Absoulutely great ! But after shutting the PC down and rebootig the next day , I couldn't get the same great sound anymore . It was all kind of .. well , just stereo ! Then I updated from AA 2.8.1 to 2.8.2Now I get all kind of echo , like in a basement . I reinstalled the driver , the software , even the game ! No change . I checked trough all the settings . Nothing wrong . I wrote 3 e-mails to the LTB customer service . Zero response , absolutely nothing ! And that is actually what gets me the most . If there is an incompatibility , I want to hear it from them ! That one day when the headset worked , it was great . But it is a little too expensive for just one day .. The microphone in the headset is not ideal . It is mounted too close to the speakers . It picks up sounds from the game and feeds them back into TeamSpeak , so all other players hear gunshots twice : once in the game , and with about a second delay on TS . It is possible to reduce that quite a bit , but I was not able to get rid of it completely .  
2	  This receiver definitely upconverts analog to HDMI - I have an TiVo Series II ( among other things ) connected to it via S-video - with only a single HDMI cable to the television . I am also sending sound to 3 zones - and getting great results ( Polk RTi speakers ) . Performance-wise , it is everything I hoped for when I bought it . It is a complicated unit - I used a professional installer . Additionally , the remote control is ridiculous - replace it with a Universal Remote . I never planned on using the remote that came with it , but rated it only 4 stars instead of 5 because of the remote and the level of complication involved in setting it up and understanding it .  
2	  i bought this camera for my sister who is obsessed with coach purses . she cant thank me enough . if buying for a female , definantly purchase coach carrying case . This camera is so tiny ! its a great gift for any age over 13  
1	  I purchased this scanner in Feburary of this year . I was pleased that the installation was easy and for what I used it for the quality of the scans were Ok . Unfortunately , the scanner totally quit functioning after 12 scans ! So the referral on this product being a " work horse " wasn't true im my particular case . In contacting the manufacturer , I learned that the effort of getting this scanner fixed wasn't worth the scanner . I would not recommend this scanner or manufacturer to anyone .  
2	  I wish it worked from behind the camera a little bit better , but otherwise this is a great purchase . Highly recommended .  
2	  the item i rivieved is just what i ordered from amazon . THANKS  
1	  I purchased JetFlash V10 , 4gb about a month and a half ago . It has simply never worked . Transcend will not honor the " Lifetime " warrantee ( they actually will not even return my emails or faxes ) . The Amazon seller will not take the item back , it was just a waste of money . I will never buy a Transcend product again .  
2	  These are pretty good earphones . They fit comfortably and sound good . I am using them as a secondary set of earphones for my iPod and they fulfill that job nicely .  
1	  I have exchanged this joystick 4 times at Walmart due to the calibration loss issue . 4 JOYSTICKS in 4 MONTHS . You will be sorry you bought it I assure you . people recomend Saitek , Microsoft , or CH joysticks . Find someone who recomends this Logitech and I 'll show you someone with a dusty stick .  
1	  Some minor problems : 1 . Screeching sound developed on the left button after a day of useage . Fixed by taking apart the mouse , and put some lube on where the button contacts / rubs the chassie . 2 . Mouse won't power up unless I put a set of fully charged battery . My guess is that it has a higher oprating voltage requirement . Fix : Charge battery before use , or use alkaline . 3 . Battery is hard to remove , the door opening is just too small . You can easilly slide it in with an angle , but very hard to do it in reverse . I ended up with my rechargeable batteries scratched ( not that I care really ) . 4 . Skin on my hand some times got cought up between the mouse and the table surface . This sounds weird I know , but if you take a look at some other Logitech mouse , you 'd noticed that the shape contours sharply inward the mouse body near bottom , and that prevents this from happening . I don't know if this make any sense , but compare those mice yourself and you 'll see what I mean . 5 . Lots of user reports reliability problem . Microsoft issued a recall on some of their ealier Intellimouse , So I don't really trust their stuff . 6 . A bit on the heavy side . I do get used to it overtime however . Some good things : 1 . Unlike some Logitch optical mice , this thing don't light up the whole room like a Chrismas tree when you use it . The light output from the LED is well covered by the non-transparent mouse body . I hate a growing mouse in dark environments . 2 . A very Logitech-like button / wheel feel and sound gives clear feedback . 3 . Good long range . 4 . Looks good . 5 . Cheap . bottom line : Too much hassle over a simple device . Go with a Logitech insted of this one .  
2	  So after burning through those worthless apple headphones that came with my ipod I began my search .. Started with a cheap pair of clip-on type of headphones that my wife had lying around , but they looked ridiculous ( made my ears look huge ) and were uncomfortable . I finally decided to stop looking like an idiot and by a decent pair of headphones to use in the gym . First I bought the Sony headphones that wrap around your head and are supposed to stick in your ear - these did not stay in for more that 5 seconds and provided me with the worst gym experience ever . I finally got the Sennheiser MX75 Twist-To-Fit In-Ear Stereo Sport Headphones and after some hesitation I was very pleased . Needless to say , I was very confused as to how to fit these things in my ear when I got them and once I did it was a little uncomfortable , but ultimately these are the best most secure and easiest to use headphones I have had to date . While slightly awkward , you get used to the fit after 5 seconds and you are set without having to adjust the headphones the rest of the time . I don't use these outside the gym , and probably wouldn't recommend them unless you were using them just for the gym as well .  
2	  ALL laptop locks can be easily circumvented by professional thieves . And ALL laptop locks provide good to excellent protection against opportunist NON-professional thieves . This lock is one of the fairly good ones . And - for the price - unbeatable .  
1	  I had a high trust in linksys routers as my previous one worked well for 5 years w / o a glitch . This one was bought half a year ago and broke down recently , it either has no warranty or it is extremely hard to find the information . It is probably not worth fixing .  
2	  This device has performed flawlessly . The device does feels cheap though . I did not have a Canon model to compare it to , but I would imagine that it feels similar . The device fits securely in the camera jack and allows you to auto focus by depressing the button half way . It has good ' action ' , I have only accidentally depressed the button too far once while trying to auto focus . It also has a shutter lock button which has proven useful for long exposure night shots . Wish I would have bought the longer cable .  
2	  I have a canon digicam & a dell laptop . The dell has inbuilt SD slot . This SD card works fine with both . I think the speed offered by this is good enough for amateurs . You don't need to pay extra bucks for that ultra II type .  
2	  We were desperate to find a cartridge for our machine - they arediscontinued so we were excited that this contact had one left .. Nice transaction . Very quick and arrived in great shape .  
1	  File and folder names started to include gibbrish at some point and after that computer stopped to recognize the disk .  
1	  Why did it take three pairs for me to finally learn my lesson and stop buying these ? Well , they have great sound , are extremely comfortable , and won't fall off . The loops do catch onto things , but the thick plastic of the headphone wires allow for easy untangling . The price is also very decent . But don't waste your money . I 've owned three of these , and all three gave out in one single ear after about a year . Maybe they 're not meant to be that portable , or maybe they 're just cheap . Either way , I 'm done with these .  
1	  I bought this to use in my new Asus 1005PR in the SD slot for ReadyBoost . It failed the speed tests not matter what I did .. and I did everything from full format NTFS , to setting the SD driver for increased performance to compressing , all of which others on the web said might get a non speed conforming SD card up to ReadyBoost standards , all of which failed . I suppose this is a good price for an SD of this size , but if you are looking to use this for ReadyBoost you need to go with a higher speed memory .  
2	  WOW ! Are these really supposed to be less than 40 bucks ? The sound is amazingly full , from classical to jazz to rock . Playing Elgar 's Enigma Variation I could hear the distinct sound of each instrument , from the treble to bass , nothing but clean crisp sound . Chopin 's piano was nothing short of heaven on these headphones . Playing some jazz saxophone , I could hear the player breath ! I have never heard that in this track when I was listening to it all the previous times . Also , you can heard where each note begins and ends , even when the sax part was soft and blanketed by the accompanyment . Moving over to my favorite rock bands , again , deep bass and crisp sound . In summary , unless you want to spend 150 + bucks on some closed and bulky headphones , you won't be able to find anything better than these headphones . And if your budget is under 50 , I don't see how you can choose any other headphone .  
1	  Despite using the International frequency tips mentioned by other reviewers , the transmitter is * frequently * interrupted by ambient radio signals . Further , the sound quality is lousy compared to the tape deck adapters I have used in the past . I bought this to replace an ailing tape deck adapter which would routinely switch sides / eject , causing continued interruptions in my music . Unfortunately , the iTrip suffers from nearly as many interruptions , and the sound quality is worse than the tape adapter when it does work . I ended up buying a new tape adapter for about the same price as this ; not looking back . To be fair , none of my complaints are , to my knowledge , specific to the iTrip FM transmitter ; I suspect all such transmitters would cause similar issues . For what it is , the iTrip appears to be a good deal ; similar transmitters cost something like $ 60 in retail stores . Still - do yourself a favor and just buy a tape adapter .  
2	  Let 's quickly move past the outrageous prices that your local store charges for an HDMI cable . ( The cheapest no-name one at my local Radio Shack was $ 30 . ) Making that comparison is not a fair fight . But given that this cable appears to have good build quality and works perfectly well connecting my 1080p laptop to my 1920x1200 external monitor , how much " should " it cost me , given the seller 's cost to make it , pay Amazon as its retail channel , and ship it to me ? $ 10 ? $ 12 ? $ 15 ? As of now , they are charging $ 2.09 with free shipping . That is dumbfounding . How can they not be losing money ? Whatever - I 'll take two , please , the one I actually need plus another to have as a virtually-free spare lying around .  
2	  Great product and great price . Use this to hook my ipod to a mixing board and it works perfectly and the sound comes across crystal clear .  
1	  Despite the great rating and rave reviews , I curse the day I brought this one home . I have gone through at least a ream of paper in the three weeks I have had this printer-not because I am so productive , but because the paper jams so often and the printer actually shreds the paper as it tries to eject . Several cries for help and complaints to HP customer service resulted in " that 's a common problem . The arm doesn't detract after each page . You will have to manually reset the arm whenever that happens . " So far , that means 6-8 times per day . No more HP for me ! This is my second bad experience . You would think I would have learned by now .  
2	  We bought 4 cables , just because the price was so low . They work great so far !  
2	  This is only great for convenience . You should still need to keep track of all your passwords in case your PC crashed or your hard drive dies . The biggest drawback I see is that this does not work with Netscape . Geez , I wonder why .. It also does not work with password protected excel spreadsheets . It 's great for logging into websites as long as you don't mind using Microsfot Internet Explorer . The Quicklink feature is very nice too . If you set up a quicklink to sign you into a website that requires a userid and password , this will be a great tool to have . All you have to do is let the reader read your fingerprint , at which point a menu with all your quicklinks appears on the bottom right screen and you just click on the quicklink that you want and it will automatically load IE and signs you into the designated website .  
2	  I bought this to replace my headset it works great and can take a beating from a lb puppy . and it still works  
1	  The mechanism that props the notebook up is not adjustable , and will not lay flat enough for MacBook / Pro notebooks to angle the display properly . The rubbery finish attracts dust and dirt like crazy , the feel of the keyboard is repulsively squishy , and the overall design of clasps / inputs is simply sub-par . For $ 70 , I was expecting a higher-end piece of hardware , not this total piece of junk . Don't buy it-it 's a gimmick .  
2	  I like it very much . I have dropped my NOOK several times and it seems to have suffered absolutely no damage . One slightly annoying feature is that once in a while one of the little elastic corner tabs works its way off the corner that it is supposed to be latching onto .  
2	  Needed to attach a few more devices thru a 8-port switch , and needed both short and medium length ethernet cables . Have used several brands in the past , including Belkin , Tripp Lite and " no-names " . Tripp Lite is heavier duty ( both the exterior insulation and the internal wires ) and the snagless connectors are great quality . Wouldn't use any other brand at this point !  
2	  I got my wallet the day I got back from a long trip .. and planed to return it .. for a refund , but then I looked at it . This wallet is perfect for the m505 and has allowed me to reduce the amount of stuff that I put into my pockets every day . The Palm slides onto the rail for a secure fit . The other flap in the wallet holds my drivers license , credit cards , cash and cards for the m505 all very nicely . The walet also fits nicely into the pocket of all my shorts and pants . It feels well crafted and the leather is very nice . Overall , I am glad I bout it ..  
2	  feel , but once you use it for a week , you will never go back to a standard keyboard . Very well done Microsoft !  
2	  This is a good beginner camera . I would put it in a class with the old Kodak Instamatic film camera - more than a toy but certainly not professional . Pros : The camera is small enough to slip in a coat pocket , easy to use , takes decent to good pictures . Cons : Batteries - Yes , it eats through batteries fast ( and by this I mean the batteries must be replaced somewhere between 12-24 pictures depending on whether flash is used ) . I did notice , however , that when the camera no longer likes the batteries , it doesn't mean they are truly dead . So don't just throw them out - try them in a flashlight first . In fact , if you let the camera rest awhile ( off for a few hours or overnight ) you may find that the battery indicator now seems ok . Dark Pictures - indoor pictures do tend to look dark , even with flash , but you can fix that with the brightness / contrast edit in the software that comes with the camera . The downer is that you can't just print them as is right away without fixing the picture first . Picture Delay - There is a delay between when you push the button to take the picture and when it actually snaps the picture . So , what this means is that you think you 've snapped the shot but then you move the camera and find out that the real time it takes the picture is not when you press the button but a few seconds afterward . The result is blurred pictures , pictures of the floor or your feet or something else you didn't really want . So , you have to be very careful when taking a picture and hold the camera very steady in position a little while after pushing the button to make sure that you get the picture . Overall : I don't regret buying this camera . It is useful and handy since it 's small . But I wish I would have purchased something a little better .  
1	  i purchased this dvd player for a trip with my kids to hawaii - they used it on the plane to hawaii and that was it - just after a year i got it out of the cupboard to take on another trip and it was broken - it would not play the dvd - i called audiovox and they wanted over $ 90 to fix it - what a joke - i barely paid $ 120 for it - i would never buy another audiovox electronic again - what a waste of money  
1	  I bought this switch last November . Last month , it stopped working , wouldn't power up . With a one year warranty , I contacted their technical support and , 3 weeks later , I received a replacement . The only problem ? The replacement didn't work either . I 'm not trying for a third .. I 'd rather have one that works .  
2	  Excellent sound and I 'm not even through the break in period yet , I 'm using an ancient Onkyo amp , and they are playing 128kbps without any major distortion unless turned up 3/4 or more . I think since I only have 50 watts going to the speaker this is excellent . I highly recommend these little things .  
2	  I was needing a headset for quite a long time , and I 've never been able to find one , but I got recommended this one , and after looking and looking , I 'd never thought Amazon would have it !  
2	  I agree with all of the positive comments about this product so I 'm not going waste your time repeating what you 've already heard . I just wanted to comment on the battery life . While not the longest battery life , I bought my Zune before my recent trip to Iraq and it lasted the whole way . I know this may not mean much to you since I haven't told you my starting location but I will say that I spent over 12hrs in the air . As with any mobile device , you have to practice good battery management . Make sure to turn off the WiFi function , reduce the time that your backlight is on ( I reduced mine to 5 secs , one was just too short ) , and avoid fliping through the menus if you don't have to . I often use the hold function to prevent my backlight from coming on . I use mine everyday while working anywhere from 8-14 hrs and mine does just fine .  
1	  I purchased many cables throughout the year and this is by far the worst quality cable I have purchased to date . The packaging and cable said Belkin on them , but that 's where the resemblance to an authentic Belkin cable ended . This cable being sold by MarginMart , Inc . is not an authentic Belkin cable and is a cheap reproduction . If your cable works when you get it , consider yourself lucky . Everything about this cable screamed low quality . The twist on ends that secure the cable were cheaply made and difficult to use . I simply unpackaged the cable and securely fastened it to both my monitor and PC just to test it out and immediately I had problems with false colors showing on the monitor . I moved the cable around and all the colors were changing as I was moving it . I kept moving it just to try and get the colors to show correctly and the monitor started blanking out . Obviously , there was something wrong with the integrity of the wires inside the cable . The cable has since stopped working altogether . I ended up purchasing the following cable and it has been working great ever since : SVGA cable from Kumo High Resolution VGA To VGA Cable ( BLUE ) - 25 FTSold by : INTERNATIONAL GLOBAL VENTURES  
2	  The BNC Female / SMA Male , Adaptor arrived soon after I ordered it and satisfied my need . The quality was acceptable .  
2	  100 % satisfied . Product works great and is easy to use . Sound is excellent and it 's a wonderful thing to have in the car ! Great value and great quality . You will be pleased if you purchase this item .  
2	  This is an excellent product for price value . I probably would not give this a 5 star rating since I 've tested several other products from sony or bose with better noise cancelling . Still the construction and sound quality is really good for the price . A little sound leakeage but this really is just an annoyance for people seating next to you . I you don't care about this you should really buy this product .  
1	  Little bit of story first , followed by my question to you all , then my good and bads on this camera : I had been waiting for this camera to be available in the market and was following the reviews too on amazon , cnet , and couple of other places . I did take a note of the ' bad ' comments , and waited to see the camera in the stores instead of pre-ordering it before the launch . I went to the stores and checked the camera out when it was launched .. inside out to the best of my knowledge . In my opinion , many of the bad comments are true . Still I wanted to buy it since I thought I can live with those bad things . by the way , there are many good things too that I liked ( why would I buy it otherwise ) . On top of goods and bads on this Sony , I had made up my mind to buy a Sony since my canon ( S1 IS ) broke down in less than 2 years ( CCD problem ) and another Canon product I had ( ZR90 camcorder ) was also broke down in less than 2 years ( CCD problem ) and I had not bought any extended guarantees . Finally I got the H9 one week ago and voila ? nope .. shot few pictures indoor and copied the images to a computer . Looked them up , it appeared fine when in 25 % view . But , the original view of the picture is so bad .. noisy , obscure , grainy , whatever term is used for it , it looks like a smaller image is digitally enlarged like in a image viewer . Picture is not sharp . So grainy . I had the 8M pixel setting by default and took the pictures in Auto mode . Later I took some shots under the sun ( it started shining in Texas last two days ! ) , and images are just a little better and no where near good quality . So .. fellow cameramen / women , what I see is what is expected out of this Sony in terms of image quality .. ? Or , am I missing something ? I compared with the images taken with Canon powershot A540 , Sony DSC-T1 , Canon Rebel Digital XT , and Canon S1 IS , I am soo disappointed to see the image quality of Sony H9 . What I see as goods .. 1 ) How quickly the camera gets ready for shooting from being switched off2 ) 31mm equivalent at wide angle3 ) Light weight4 ) Good Flash5 ) large LCD6 ) Many other features that I have not tried yetBads .. 1 ) Not quite handy to hold ( may be because I want to avoid scratching the LCD ) 2 ) 74mm lens size , not so standard . 3 ) Battery type , not so standard . 4 ) No power adapter comes with the camera to connect to power directly5 ) LCD is so large that our fingers rub it every time we use the camera . 6 ) Lens hood is pretty large7 ) Strap holders are like ears to the camera ( does not help the camera being a compact ) Like I said earlier , I can live with all these bads .. but I can't keep the camera if the quality what I see is what it delivers .  
1	  E Machine Laptop heats up and shuts off and the monitor flickers . I have sent it back three times and today is the fourth time , as it continues to shut off and flickers . I have it for less than a year , and I cannot get my money back . I have written the Attorney General at their Irvine , California headquarters to try to get my money back . Let 's hope that works . Ed in Philadelphia  
2	  I can rest assured that my new HDTV is being protected . I like this surge protector because it protects both my cable and antenna coaxial connections . It has antenna , cable , and satellite coax protection circuits which I like a lot . Just look at the technical details on this site . The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I am sick and tired of everything being manufactured in China . I prefer to buy things that are made in the USA but that is getting almost impossible to do these days .  
1	  I bought this coupler to put two 25 ' phone cords together ( the cord between the hand set and the phone itself ) . We were always stretching a single cord beyond its limitations when talking on the phone . However , when using this coupler , I could not get a clear connection between two cords . I tested both cords ( at first I thought I had a defective cord ) but I determined the issue was with the coupler . Perhaps it just should be considered only for line cords ( between the wall jack and phone ) that do not have tension .  
1	  Yes it 's a cool product . But it 's essentailly disposable technology starting at $ 300 a pop . The battery is NOT replacable , it 's internal and will cost you price of a new one to " repair " it . They are involved in at least 5 class action lawsuits regarding this issue . Also they advertise the battery runs for 8hrs .. that 's if you just turn it on and let it run .. not pressing any buttons or using the backlight etc . We 've used ours with what I consider normal use and found it only last about 3.5 hrs $U$ product with poor design flaws .  
2	  We received our replacement charger for our Sony camcorder on time as expected . It appears to be well made and all parts fit together tightly . Though it has just been a short period of time since we received it , and therefore we / I cannot attest to its longevity , it has already given us many hours of repeated use . Overall I am very satisfied with the product . It was an excellent value for the price .  
1	  Received the Jensen 20 " today . Eventually got it all hooked up , but no picture . I 'm the second reviewer to receive this set new with a bad picture tube . The sound worked , but it was rather muddy sounding . I gave it 2 stars because it looks good just sitting turned off . Don't waste your time on this .  
2	  The cable works fine . No loss of data . It is much better quality cable than the 6 ' cableI paid $ 36 for when I bought the printer  
1	  I ordered this speaker new . I was sent a used one that was covered in dirt and FOOD . It was also missing the power cord so it couldn't even be used . The instructions manual was missing as well . I would advise everyone against purchasing this speaker from Galactics .  
1	  This mp3 player was great when I first got it . However , I 've not had it even a week yet , and it has begun freezing up and having other various problems . I would not suggest this item .  
1	  Three weeks after having the unit home , I came home one evening to find it brightly lit , with no characters on the display . No buttons functioned , it would not turn off , the CD door would not open ( with three of my CDs loaded inside ) , and there was that telltale pungent odor of burning electronics . All this occurred after the unit had been OFF for several days . Having read another review dealing with Emerson 's reliability issues , I decided to return the unit and upgrade to a Panasonic 5-disc system . The speakers were better and Panasonic does not have the overall reliability problems Emerson seems to have . But , with the Panasonic , I lost that subwoofer out that I liked so much in the Emerson . Bottom line , check out the Emerson . It has a lot of nifty features for the price . If you can take a chance on the reliability issues , you 'll have a fine-sounding micro system at a mini price .  
1	  The ad . did not indicate that this products digital camera only worked with Windows and not MAC . All of our computers are MAC and so the product had to be returned .  
2	  I am very pleased with this product . I like it even more than the others I have used in many hotels rooms-it 's quiet but dries my hair really well . I like the nightlight but I unplug it during the day since it isn't sensitive to light / dark .  
1	  When new it worked good , but after a short time it lost its mind , and would not play anything and started eating tapes . Too bad who ever makes Sylvania now doesn't have the quality they used to be known for .  
2	  This is the best protection filter for digital bodies at any reasonable price . I have the 58mm version . Buy it instead of a UV filter . LensTip rated all the major UV filters in mid-2009 . The worst filter was a generic Tiffen UV , which let in 88 % of visible light and caused a lot of flare . Tied for first place above all the German brands were two Hoya UV filters : the Pro1 MC and the UV ( 0 ) . Both passed 97.1 % of visible light and did not cause flare . The best B & W ; filter passed 98 % of visible light at the expense of high-frequency UV . This is not a UV filter . It 's just a piece of glass multi-coated to prevent reflections . And that 's perfect , because light transmission for multi-coated glass is about 99.5 % . Digital bodies are already UV-filtered . The haze that UV can cause with film at higher altitudes doesn't exist on digital ; there 's no reason to pay extra for UV filtering . BH Photo had the best price for this one . My copy arrived without flaws . Build quality for the metal ring is average . It 's standard-thickness , so if you plan to leave it on a wide-angle forever and stack a polarizer , choose a slim filter instead . I 've had cheap off-brand filters that threaded just as easily . It 's certainly rougher than brass , though to no consequence . The coating , though , is the best I 've seen . No additional glare at all from any angle relative to the bare front element on my 100/2 . But should you buy this filter at all ? Maybe . Things to consider are whether the lens will be resold , exposure to inclement conditions , your clumsiness , the use of lens hoods , and how often you clean the lens . For this filter and similar high-end models from B & W ; , it 's almost impossible to see any negative effect on images even with point light sources that would cause lesser filters to flare . This is a nonissue . Of more import is that the filter keeps water and cruft off the front element . You can wipe things down with a t-shirt on the fly without worrying about scratching lens coatings . Protection for more severe treatment is marginal . If you drop a lens on a filter , it 's probably going to damage internal lens components and break the filter . If you drop it without a filter , your filter thread and potentially the front element will be damaged , in addition to the internals . Drop it lens hood down and you 'll probably just break the hood . For those not shooting in rain and dirt , a lens hood alone may be preferable unless the lens focal is so wide that the hood doesn't protrude . Should you care about your front element ? For photos , no . You can scratch it or even break it to little effect in most lighting . Severe damage ( e.g. , scribbling on it with a screwdriver ) will cause flare and drop contrast a bit . Cleaning marks from a t-shirt won't affect anything . A filter won't be economical if you 've got a kit lens like the 18-55 or 55-250 , or sensible if the lens has a small and recessed front element like the 50/1.8 . There 's little purpose to dropping $ 25 or $ 30 to protect a cheap lens from damage it 's unlikely to encounter . Where the front element matters is resale . Buyers will ding you 10-15 % of the lens value if it has cleaning marks or coating scratches . Desirable lenses ordinarily sell for about 75 % of their new value . Less desirable and third party lens , perhaps 50 % . Even if you assume damage , it 's therefore not economically rational to buy a $ 30 filter for a desirable lens that costs less than $ 400 new , or an undesirable one less than $ 600 . That said , I 'm very enamored with my $ 350 lens , so I bought a filter from this line for it . The combination of low price , top-class coatings , and light transmission is unbeatable .  
2	  For it 's size and main function the sound quality on this unit is exceptionally good . Other brands have models that have many features , but skimp on the sound quality . The Phi aj3950 features both making it an exseptional buy . The one thing it could use , a repeat track function . All in all I don't mind waking up next to it .  
1	  I had been looking for the right GPS for quite a while , balancing whether I wanted the bells and whistles along with a hefty price tag or go for a bare bones unit . Then the Go 720 crossed my screen . Bluetooth , MP3 player , large screen , the features are impressive with a price tag that the stores would have a hard time to match . Also , sad as it sounds , wanted the Homer Simpson voice as I thought it would break the boredom on an upcoming trip I had planned . Unfortunately , that 's where my praise ends . The first GPS I received refused to sync with my computer and in fact , got corrupted almost straight out the box . Second unit had no initial problems and synced with the PC fine , downloaded the latest map , signed up on Map Share , added some points of interest and even managed to download the Homer Simpson voice I was after with no problems ( cost $ 13 though ) . Thought I would do some trial runs and it seemed to be pretty much on par with what I believed were the quickest routes . Then came the fateful day I put my trust in the TomTom . The route to say the least was bizarre . Even though I had specified no unpaved roads , it took them until eventually the sign read , road closed . Now , going up dark , one car width lanes , Homer 's voice kept telling me to turn around , but to where , back home ? I was lost and my downloaded celebrity voice was now the most annoying thing on the planet . Eventually , I got to my destination by ignoring it and using a good old fashioned map . TomTom told me to go straight on at an intersection , when I knew I had to go right . Having taken the right , it readjusted to the correct route and shaved 10 minutes off the eta . As the celebrity voices become very irritating after a while ( it would keep using the same punchline over and over again and would not tell you any street names ) , I resorted back to the computer voice . Then I noticed that it kept stuttering resulting in the voice not working at all . Then I would loose the Bluetooth feature though both issues would restore after continual warm starting . Little less than a week after owning it , it died completely . A blessed relief in my honest opinion .  
1	  The adapter appears to be a multiple adapter - BUT the one specific size connector I needed for 4.5 volt does NOT fit the two 4.5 volt openings for which I ordered the adapters ! ; - ( Also , for the correct settings to use - the directions are of no help at all !  
2	  Works well . Get a good charge every time . To answer the question about alkalines . On a very rare occasion , you will find a product that requires 1.5V . For these products , the rechargeables won't work , but for 95 + % of electronics , the rechargeables work as good or better .  
1	  Do not buy this player if you are considering it . It was nice for a couple of years but the DVD player Optical pickup unit ( which from what I 've read , commonly goes out on Panasonic ) is failing . It was nice to get everything in one package but I recommend not getting an amp and DVD player in one case due to the heat issues . And I am now in the process of replacing this unit with Sony components ( I should have done from the start ! )  
2	  It took me a while to figure our how this thing works . It was expecting it to work more like a usb drive , but it had a wierd program that wasn't so clear cut . Besides that it is all fine  
1	  My daughter bought a Magellan GPSr . The hardware 's features were great ! Since I own a Garmin V , I thought she might have out-skunked the old man . That was right up until we tried to find map software for this GPS . ( The base map is ok if you like traveling interstate routes without street detail for cities . ) So , what good is a GPS without map software ? Generally USELESS ! We bought MAPSEND Streets & Destinations USA . Thank the lord I only spend $ 39.00 on it . Good for the seller , bad for me . I should have recognize the clues when there was NOT a " Streets & Destinations USA " version for sale on the Magellan home page . ( hint , hint , hint ) I HAVE VERSION V4.00F . THE MAPS ARE SO OUT OF DATE THEY CAN ONLY BE USED FOR BASIC STREET NAVIGATION . MANY POIs DON'T EXIST ANYMORE AND IN SOME CASES THE ACCURACY IS SO BAD STREET CROSSROADS ARE OFF BY HUNDREDS OF FEET . Do not waste your money on Magellan products unless they get their mapping software FIXED and stop ripping off their customers . Magicman  
2	  I bought this hand crank / solar powered radio about 3 years ago and use it about 3 times a week ( mostly to shower by ) . The sound is good and I can listen to between 20-35 minutes of music on about 100 continuous turns of the crank . It also recharges when left in direct sunlight-though I prefer to crank it as my bathroom doesn't get direct sunlight . It 's guilt free radio , too , because it uses no electricity !  
2	  Although the Garmin Nuvi 360 doesn't always go where I think it should , it gets me there . And if I stray off the path it wants to send me on , it recalculates quickly , almost as if it knows where I want to go . I bought the friction mountGarmin Portable Friction Mount for Garmin GPS Units ( 010-10306-00 ) which I like better than having it stuck on the windshield or rather permanently on the dashboard . Oh yes , you can pair it with your bluetooth-enabled phone and make and receive calls . Very cool . Most of the reviews for the model 350 have already said what I have to say , so there 's not much to add . You do get a free Audible book ( two " small " ones or one big one ) which you can listen to if while you travel . You are required to sign up for a trial Audible membership , but after you 've downloaded your book , you can cancel on-line . ( I bought Bill Bryson 's A Short History of Nearly Everything which I had already read , but want to re-visit ) . A Short History of Nearly EverythingIn sum , the Nuvi 360 is one of the coolest " toys " I 've ever owned . Just don't let it distract you too much . You won't be able to take your eyes off it , even though it speaks very well on its own . ( P.S. My wife and I agree that " Jack " is an easier voice to understand than " Jill " .  
1	  Although I would really like to give this stand three stars , I can't give it any more than two . The stand is beautiful , sturdy and does a good job of holding your laptop . Great . It contains a cable routing hole in the rear to keep cables neat . Smart . That said , this product suffers from a single major design flaw that just can't be overlooked : The cable routing hole is too small to accommodate the DVI plug from an apple Cinema display , despite the fact that the stand is shown * right next to * an apple cinema display in the product 's retail packaging . FAIL.Fail . Fail . Fail . Did rain design not try to plug this into a single laptop accompanied by a Cinema Display before taking the design to the manufacturing step ? Incredible . Sure , you can bypass the hole for the cinema display plug , but then what 's the point in having the cable routing in the first place ?  
2	  Does a great job charging . I assume it is treating my batteries well . Does not have a fast charging setting though that I know of .  
2	  Product works well and arrived quickly . The battery life is longer then expected . I think this was a great deal for the price .  
2	  I got this portable keyboard to use with my pocket PC . I was on a month long trip and wanted to be able to type notes . In this regard , it was great . The keyboard folded up to about the same size as my pocket PC , yet when unfolded was a nice-feeling keyboard and reliable for text entry . I literally wrote a book using this keyboard , around 150 pages of notes and impressions from my trip . I 've moved to Windows Phone since I got this keyboard , but if I am in a similar situation and Belkin makes a similar folding keyboard for the Windows phone , I wouldn't hesitate to buy it based on my experience with this one !  
2	  Not sure if Philips corrected the problems mentioned by others ( the dim lcd and the absence of cue and review ) , but my EXP103 arrived yesterday , and let me assure you : lcd is FINE , and cue and review can both be accomplished by pressing and holding down the & gt ; & gt ; or << button for long enough to invoke this feature ( it 's possible that these folks just didn't bother to read the instructions carefully ) . Let me also assure you : THIS PACKAGE ROCKS ! I 've tried it stand-alone with both mp3 and music cd 's . Plenty of volume and good sound . The earphones included aren't my type ( I don't like the kind you stick in your ears ) , but so what , you can get a good headset reasonably priced right here at amazon . I 've tried both mp3 and music cd 's with the car kit - very good sound and plenty of volume , and I have a generic cassette player . The anti-skip feature works great . I haven't even tried some of the other features , but I 've tried all the essentials I want , and I 've come to this conclusion : THIS DEVICE IS KILLER ! Philips included basically EVERYTHING you need . Even though I know prices will be dropping , I can already tell on day one of use that it was worth the price . Go for it !  
2	  The 1GB silver Sandisk is great . You can download songs very easily , and it comes with a computer disk that gives you a walkthrough of how to do it . It has a great FM radio that has 20 available presets , and a voice recorder that works very well . The only thing that I do not like about it is that i havent yet figured out how to delete songs . You only need to use 1 AA battery , and it lasts a very long time . It is small and lightweight , so it can go pretty much anywhere . The menu is easy to read , and the buttons are big so that you dont have to try and push little tiny ones . I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a mp3 player .  
2	  Nice to have to protect my lens glass . Last filter looked just like the broken one on the label of this one .  
1	  I had never heard of " open " ear headphones . Seems like a strange idea ; aren't you wearing headphones to block out ambient noise ? These do not block out ambient noise at all . The product description says : " Good attenuation of ambient noise " - that is a ridiculous claim . I can easily hear the conversations in the office with these headphones on . Its like not wearing headphones . The top-rated review for this product influenced me to buy these , with this statement : " Other reviewers have mentioned that the open format of these headphones results in large sound leakage into the air around you . I 've found that the leakage is quite small , and not noticeable a couple feet away . Then again I don't crank the sound up to 100 decibels . " This statement is completely untrue . My co-workers can easily hear any music that I play through these headphones , when I have the volume turned way down . Do not buy these for an office environment , or any environment where you want to block out ambient noise , and where you don't want to expose others to your music . These would not be allowed in my office . I only tested them for 20 seconds ; they just don't block out sound . Sure , the sound quality is good ; they are comfortable , and look well-made . It is a strange design that is not at all what I was looking for . Now I have to go through the hassle of returning them . This is the big downside of buying online .  
2	  great case . not to big , not to small . also avail at wally world for same price minus shipping :(  
1	  I found that the quality of this headphone to be worse than the set that came with my ipod . In order to get quality bass it had to be inserted far into the ear , and during physical activity ( working out at the gym ) it constantly became dislodged , causing the sound to be very tinny .  
2	  I bought this TV over a month ago . I have nothing but good things to say about it . The HD picture is sharp . I had to do very little adjustments on it to make the picture perfect . It has a number of connections , including 2 HDMI and 2 component cables . The 1080p picture looks fantastic as well when you have a PS3 or some other kind of Blue Ray DVD plugged in . The speakers also produce much better sound than most TV 's of this size . The only real drawback is that the standard definition channels tend not to look very good and are very blocky . Overall I am very happy that I purchased this television . It is definitely the highest quality 1080p TV around that can be purchased for under $ 2000 .  
1	  I purchased this mainly as an alarm but was happy with the multiple features it offered . I was disappointed that the volume of the morning alarm could not be set below " 10 " which was , IMHO very loud . There was a sticker added to the manual explaning that the alarm volume could not be set below ' 10 ' , but if you were just listening to the radio like during the day , you could easily adjust the volume down below ten or up . Since there was this ' sticker ' added after the fact in the usage guide , I have to believe it was a manufacturing ' oversight ' during product design .  
1	  Oh they look good and are comfortable . Only one problem : they don't work . The left earphone did not work right out of the box . This is clearly the result of poor wiring or a short in the unit and poor quality control .  
2	  I purchased Icom VHFs many times and I recommended them to my colleague also because I was sure of their exeellent quality and preformance . And I have never heard any complaint regarding thier quality and performance . Icom VHF gave me and my colleageu full satisfaction .  
1	  I credit Creative Labs with an innovative product . I like the display on the remote control . However , it was too slow to navigate through the songs when searching for a song to play .  
2	  The WorkCentre has an excelent ADF . Although the price is a little bit high , it did worth ! . Congratulations to Xerox .  
2	  Serial ATA drives perform better than the equivelant Parralel ATA drive from the same manufacturer . If you 're current system doesnt have SATA support on board you can easily get a controller card for a decent price to add this capability to you 're current desktop . I have noticed a very significant speed increase in raw data rates when put head to head with PATA drives and this Western Digital drive is a very solid performer . In addition to the speed increase over Parallel , you also have the ability to mount more than 2 drives ( master , slave ) to each controller enabling you 're system to have as many as 16 drives per controller , you can also add multiple controllers so you 're limiting factor is the case the system is mounted in . With 250GB per spindle , were talkin about storage in the range of 4 Terabytes in a non-RAID configuration ( Redunt Array of Independant Disks ) . With RAID5 you gain some degree of fault tolerance , which is the ability to lose one drive per controller without losing data . As a single drive replacement for existing parallel ATA , this will prove itself quite worthy in most any system . If it is an add in drive , you should consider migrating the operating system to it for speed and use the slower existing drives to offload storage .  
1	  I own a sony camera which they no longer make the memory stick for .. i thought id end up buying a new camera when i found this and thought it would be the answer . I ordered this memory stick because it clearly stated and showed that it came with an adaptor that would allow it to work in my camera .. it arrived without the adaptor . I now have to order the adaptor seperately and hope the memory stick works .  
2	  After three years of wanting and drooling , I finally bought a digital camera . Now of course , I had my doubts and worries , so I held my breath with each click I made which led me to purchase the Olympus Camedia D-380 . My fears subsided when I began to test the features of this camera when I received it the next day . This is a great beginner 's camera . At the highest resolution ( 1600x1208 ) , you can take 5 photos . At the lowest resolution ( 640x480 ) , you can take up to 47 photos , although it 's not the best quality . By default , the setting is at 1600x1200 , which allows for 16 photos . I use 1024x768 which gives me 29 photos . Keep in mind that these number of photos are on an 8MB memory card . A higher card will produce more clicks for your buck . For the most part , I didn't need the instruction booklet to guide me through the steps . I find it simple to operate , and mainly used the booklet to understand what the icons represented . There was very little which I couldn't figure out where I used the booklet to understand . This camera is simple to operate . This is my first camera of any kind , and I found it worth my money . The first thing I noticed was how light this camera was . It felt like a toy , but it 's functions proved otherwise . The four AA batteries will add some weight to the camera , but not by much . After every photo , the image will freeze for less than a second in the LCD screen . You can view your photos through the thumbnails offered , and delete those which you don't want , saving space and meory for those good photos . The Olympus Camedia D-380 can also record mini movies ( without sound of course ) . The more difficult aspect I found was the application which comes with this Camera , but the problems where easily worked through . Over all , I found this camera to meet my needs . I 'd recommend it to anyone first starting out .  
1	  It 's unfortunate that a company would sell a piece of CAT-5E for this much money . There are no such things as pristine 0 's and 1 's . I understand the ' audiophile ' philosophy , but this is ridiculous . Digital signals do not get better with gold plating , or by paying enormous amounts of money . Digital signals are digital signals . CAT-5 cables also relies on balanced lines which means that the signal is transmitted down the twisted pairs as inverses of each other . This technique effectively cancels out interference over CAT-5E without the $ 495 markup . If you are looking for a " AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable " , buy yourself a 2 meter CAT-5E cable and pocket the rest .  
2	  I 've always liked panasonic , I feel you cant go wrong . We just sold our 2 year old 5 disk dvd changer , we would of purchased the newer version but we wanted the HDMI which it did not have nor did it have the optical which I cannot understand , but anyways we are happy with the picture it looks much better than our old one and our old one looked great , but this one looks even better . I can't tell you how it compares to any other dvd player but I can tell you that you will not be disapointed . I hope this helps  
1	  This is a great set . I almost bought it from Amazon until I noticed that they want to charge you $ 120 for shipping . Are you kidding me ? There are quite a few other reputable online retailers that have this set for the same price and don't gouge you for shipping ( < $ 30 ) . Sorry Amazon , you 're not getting my business for this purchase .  
2	  These earphones sound surprisingly good . They are very light and produce a nice sound . Don't expect these to sound like Bose earphones but they sound much better than my pair of $ 60 earphones from Sony . They fold nicely but the travelling bag is too tight a fit to make it easy to use . I have also read other reviewers who are concerned about the flimsy plug and I would agree . All in all though , I am certainly happy with ths product .  
1	  I purchased this product less than a year ago - mounted for use in late October , 2005 and like numerous others the LCD went out over 3 months ago providing only 6 months of use . Called Polaroid - same story - 3 months warranty - will replace upon return of unit and $ 110.00 . When I asked if they should have a recall on this product because numerous customers reported the same problem , Polaroid stated that for the number sold that the complaints received were not sufficient . I loved the product while it worked , however it is overpriced since they determine it to be disposable ( working only 6 months or less ) . Recommend not purchasing if you can't afford replacement every few months .  
1	  I bought this camera the first month it was out and I hate it . The picture quality is very bad . Just about all the pictures come out blurry even with a tripod . I contacted kodak to posibly return the item and was told they would not take it back . This product does not perform as promised the 5mp kodak easy share I bought 4 years ago takes better pictures , and it cost $ 175.00 less .  
1	  I loved this keyboard when I first got it . As other reviewers have noted , it occasionally missed a keystroke , or would even duplicate keystrokes , but I assumed this was par for the course with a wireless device . After about 6 months , performance had gradually degraded to having to hold the keyboard in just the right position to get it to recognize even a single keystroke . Another few weeks , and the device didn't work at all . I bought a replacement ( the RMA process for Adesso seemed like a hassle , and I didn't have the original box which was a requirement ) and the new replacement keyboard is worse than the first ! Right out of the box , the touchpad doesn't work at all , but it does appear to be sending a left-click periodically , often when I 'm nowhere near the keyboard . I 'm going to have to take this one back immediately . If the third time 's not a charm , I may try out the Logitech diNovo Mini instead . - Update : 2009.9.6I have owned three of these keyboards ( am typing on one now , in fact ) . I don't have experience with other wireless keyboards , so I can't compare it to others , but I can tell you what 's wrong with this model , with plenty of qualified experience . MY SEETUP : I use this keyboard as the intnerface to my home-theater PC , which is attached to my television 6 feet in front of me . I sit on the couch with the keyboard in my lap . The receiver is connected to the front of the PC and there is a direct line of sight to it from the keyboard . Sometimes I sit 1 foot away and stitll have these problems . As you can see from mthis review 's text , the problems with this keyboard are evident . CONS FIRST : - misplaced / delayed keystrokes . Typing " letters " you 'll get " leterts " or , as I have gotten twice while attempting to type this bullet-point , " letterrs . " Which leads me to .. - repeated keystrokes . It is merely annoying when you type " This keyboard blows " and get " Thiss keyboaard blws . " But it 's * PAINFUL * when you use a keyboard shortcut and this keyboard repeats it ad infinitum . Example : use ctrl + backspace to delete a previous word - this keyboarrd will often continue to delete words as long as you hold the ctrl key , deleting entire paragraphs . Exampmle 2 : use ctrl + F4 to close tabs in the browser . Doing so on this keyboard will often close every single tab you have open . - unresponsiveness . Sit with the keyboard facing the computer and you 're ok ( with only occasional typos ) . Lean back with the keyboard tilted upward , and you get this : theuickroewfox jumpedver the lazyThat 's my attempt at " The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog . " Yes , I typed everyy letter . PROS : Makes a great gag gift . I 've had three of these keyboards because at some point eachc one has exhibited the same problems , and each time I have lived with it until I couldn't take the torture anymore . Save y ourself the heartache , learn from my lesson and do not buy this product .  
2	  Having fallen in love with everything but the price for some Bose headphones I tried at the ipod store - I began to look for some similar " over the ear " phones at a more reasonable price .. These are the ones I chose , and I love them - good sturdy phones at a great price .  
1	  I am still waiting for this article . I 've emailed the guyssupposedly sending this twice . He said he would look into it , but nothing has happened . What do I do next / Jim Malone  
2	  Works perfectly ! Plugged it into the phone , turned it on and the phone took over . I now have over 500 mp3 's on the card plus 30 some Java apps , not to mention the pictures .. I have no idea of what the access speed is rated at , but the delay is not too long to wait to load up 25 CD 's worth of music . ( about 10 seconds ) The phone is rated for 512 mb 's , but this 1 gig card works just fine !  
2	  Great for the Kindle ! Folds into a very compact size . Will be perfect for travel so I ordered another for my husband !  
1	  As others have stated , this kit is a total waste of money . It only lasts for about 10 pictures before it loses it 's charge . It almost makes using the camera unenjoyable to use , as you constantly have to worry when the batteries will die . I don't use it anymore , I buy the CR-V3 batteries .  
2	  As an IT professional it 's imperative that I 'm able to establish and keep an active VPN connection for remote support and troubleshooting . I have been incredibly impressed with how the D-Link DIR-655 has performed . In our household we are extremely heavy internet users and consistently transfer a couple hundred gigs worth of streaming content a month . The DLink DIR-655 has performed this task flawlessly . I can have 4 simultaneous Netflix streams and still maintain a rock solid VPN connection without the unit breaking a sweat . If anyone is looking for a rock solid replacement for an aging Wireless G router you should definitely buy this wireless router . I recommend it to all of the remote users that I support and once they deploy this product all of their connectivity issues disappear . SincerelyAn Extremely Happy IT Engineer  
1	  The product that I ordered did not fit my camcorder but that was not their fault , Sony told me the wrong product to get , although I did send the item back after this company told me I was able to , which I did send it to the address that they provided me . After about two and a half weeks of no credit to my credit card , I E mailed them asking if they received the product back and why I was never refunded . I received no reply what so ever . I told them to e mail me back and I also left my phone number to contact me by , nothing . I finally got a hold of someone by calling them , again after repeated voice messages left . They are now saying they never received the product back and I would not be receiving any refund . Even though I have the receipt from the post office sending the product back . Now I am out the price of the product , two separate shipping and handling charges and I don't even have the product . Very un happy with this company and do not recommend them at all , Amazon should not sell their products , I have always liked using Amazon , now I am probably not going to use this site again either .  
2	  I bougth this camera in replace of a sony point and shot camera . My idea was get a camera whit more zoom and better quality in pictures taked at night and low light rooms . When I saw the reviews , some people said that there was problems with pictures and they saw that have blur , but many people said that the camera is good . Then I bought it and I took a couple weeks to read manuals and make the adjustments to get excellent pictures . This is the camera that I was searching , and by the price is an excellent option .  
1	  Broken record of a review . The print heads hopelessly clogged after about a year . Not only that , when i disassembled as much as i could , i found the ink tube / straw feed to the heads had popped off , which is why nothing at all was coming out . You need to be a surgeon with unattainable instruments to put the tubes back into one another ( they 're both about the same diameter ) . Lexmark = junk , Epson = junk , now i have to try a Hewlett-Packard . This problem is unfixable as my ink stained hand and high blood pressure will attest . Screw you , Epson .  
1	  As with another reviewer , the quick release is a problem . It gets jammed and I can't get the camera off , except after several minutes of pushing and pulling . No confidence in this head . Otherwise it works fine ..  
1	  Batteries last about 30 minutes in this thing - it only works when it wants to , even in the car - don't buy this !  
1	  Hi everyone .. I got this one for my new blackjack . I was not interested in it because of the price but because I wanted something conventional wired handsfree for my phone without a bluetooth ( I think bluetooth is not yet accepted culturally and makes you look like a clown in meetings .. Anyway ! ) As soon as I got it .. I tried to plug it in my phone .. it wont plug in .. I was afraid I might damage my phone port connector .. Also even after connecting it makes a thundering sound whenever I change my ringtone or music or click website links .. I would say if you dont want to buy a bluetooth .. dont go for this one at least .. use handsfree speakers .. thats what I am gonna do !  
2	  I have been running this drive more-or-less continuously for 1 year . It does get moved around now and then to various PCs , and it gets packed up and driven cross-country twice a year . It gets heavy , daily use because it stores my music collection . The drive is quiet and does not run hot . The footprint is reasonable given the amount of storage provided . The enclosure is sturdy with a rubbery covering on the sides and edges . It has occasionally made ominous motor sounds ( sounds like a bad bearing ) , but it always stops after a short time . The drive is configured RAID 1 . I do not use the Retrospect backup software ( horrible installation experience ; I never have high expectations for software that is thrown in with devices so I don't really include that in my assessment ) . Overall a good , solid piece of equipment that works as advertised . * UPDATE 5/14/08 * It died . I experienced an I / O error while adding tracks to my iTunes library ; subsequently , Windows would not recognize the drive . Retried on several different computers and with both Firewire and USB . Fortunately , all of the data on the drive was backed up so it 's not a disaster , just irritating .  
1	  Shuffle 1 GB and sleek design got it . itunes is absolutetly the worst thing ever . they keep telling me to upgrade and it never does what i want . Do you want to load a CD . No . Then it does anyway . Puts tracks in the wrong order . Impossible to manage . It actually got erased from my comp and when reinstalled itunes and loaded the shuffle into the USB it tells me I have to seek it with the current library , which is empty and everything gets erased . i got the shuffle for free but will never buy an apple product ever , let the rest of the lemmings look cool jumping off a bridge i 'm sticking to my cell mp3 .  
2	  I have had this printer for a few months now and am very satisfied with the performance . I was looking for photo quality printing to use with my digital camera and this printer surpassed my expectations . The card reader slot is another bonus and makes printing index prints quick and easy . I have had no set up or operation problems . I hope this printer lasts a long time as I am very happy with it .  
1	  I purchase this camera december 2004 , i really like the design stlye its amazing . After a month or so the zooming start to malfuction , if i zoom to say 10X the camera start to unzoom its self back to 1X , . Because of this shooting a video is really hard beyond 1X , i have to keep using my finger to try an keep the zooming steady . At that time i figure it was a function of me not knowing how to used it so i did not return it then . After reading the manual a few time i realized its the camera 's fault so i sent it to JVC . They call me to say the need $ 150 before they can start to look at it . I realy feel rip-off , i have not even get $ 50 value use since i 've got it and i have to start spending on it already . I really made a mistake in buying this camera .  
2	  Correct rating on these I received via Amazon from Parts Express ( printed right on the product ) : 150Hz @ 8ohms300Hz @ 4ohmsSo these are useless to me personally . I contacted Parts Express via email , and they quickly and professionally handled my issue . Very very happy with the seller Parts Express !  
1	  If this worked , it would be great . Unfortunately , it doesn't . Even with the unit placed on top of the radio ( a high-end JVC - some reviewers have mentioned that reception was dependent on the quality of the FM receiver ) , it was still filled with static , and sounded cheap ( which admittedly , the iPod is ) . I don't know if it 's worth the postage to return it to Amazon . From all I 'm reading , it might work well if you 're in an uncrowded FM area ( but I wouldn't bet on it ) .  
2	  Great product that is easy to use . I bought one for my husband to use during work and he liked it so much that he bought me one too ! 5 star product !  
2	  This camera is very easy to use , and the color pictures look great ! It came with everything I needed to get started right out of the box . I also got larger a xD memory card ( 128MB or higher would be about right ) , a charger , 2 sets re-chargeable batteries , and now I 'm set ! It 's a keeper ! There 's also an waterproof / underwater housing for it as well .  
2	  First of all I like to thank Amazon for not making me wait for my brand new toy . It arrived it seemed like as soon as I confirmed my payment ! Honestly it must have taken all of 2 days ! When I saw the box on the table I just knew it wasnt the printer because I had just placed the order not even 48 hrs earlier . But wait , there 's more . The quality pictures that this printer provides is EXCEPTIONAL ! .. They are literally postcard perfect ! You cant tell the difference . Flawless . I would recommend this to ANYONE who loves to take and print pictures its a must have ..  
2	  The Grill & Go Camp Stove is the perfect toy for kids of all ages . It comes with the little grill that lights up and makes real grilling sounds when you add batteries . It also has a coffee pot , frying fan , and several utensils . Willow loves playing with it , and I know its safe for her because there are no small pieces that can detach . Even my older kids love it . The three of them set up a campsite in the living room , and had loads of fun pretending to grill up some hamburgers and hot dogs for their trip . The best thing about it , is that when the kids are all done playing , all the pieces can be stored inside the case so its less likely they will lose all the pieces .  
1	  Product is fine , but why purchase from a seller that charges exhorbitant prices for individual shippin ? !  
1	  This radio should preform better for being close to $ 50 . I 'm 50 miles from Detroit and 30 miles from Toledo and most nights I only receive static . I wouldn't buy it if you are looking for a radio to draw in distant stations if you live in a more rural area .  
1	  After having for one week the earpiece does not work . do not recommend to any one for that u buy a bluetooth .  
2	  Great product very easy to install . All you need is internal Sata ports and then you quickly connect the product to your computer and have two aditional esata external ports . You need activate in the Setup boot of your computer , but be very carefull y you have Raid configuration because you need special definition otherwise you can lost you data . If you do not have Raid then only put on your sat ports and ready to work . I have connected two 1 Terabyte Western Digital with esata ports to my computer and know it is flying on time response .  
1	  I 've had two of these and each time the z-axis ( twist ) control fails . I 've read alot of negative reviews conserning the same . Two thumbs down for this product , I 'm extremely unhappy with it .  
2	  Used with a " Little Wil " Wilson magnetic mount antenna . Very easy to switch from auto to handheld mode and gets decent distance and good reception both as a handheld portable with the Rubber Duckie antenna and hooked up in my car with the " Little Wil " . Worth the money . I do wish there was a way to hang it on my dash , but I used a piece of velcro , hook part stuck on my dash ( " 3/4 square ) . The little radio is light enough that the velcro works fine .  
1	  This keyboard is excellent except for the space key , which is used the most . The issue is that this key doesn't push down without large force . My fingers get tired quickly with keep pushing this space key . Sometimes I had to use both my fingers to push it . It also makes noise when you push it . After 1-2 days trial , my finger 's muscle gets tired and never want to use it anymore .  
2	  Pros : excellent tracking on a variety of surfaces , especially for fps games such as UT2004 ; buttons work great ; wheel works great for both scrolling and clicking ; has lasted me 4 years and countingCons : a tad bulky for small hands , for which the Logitech MX310 might be a better choice ; side buttons should be shifted inward ; feet may peel off on hard surfaces  
1	  If this DVD player worked as advertised it would be a great unit and I do like the space savings aspect . The main problem I have is that the DVD player has difficulty accessing menus on some DVDs . It displays the menus wrong and won't allow selection of some items . Another annoyance seems to be with the actual decoding of the DVD during playback . Usually during the course of a movie there will be one or more glitches , which amount to a slight pause or skip . Sometimes the video appears scrambled momentarily . Worst of all , the unit I have seems to hang up or get into a mode where it doesn't respond to any buttons ( even the power switch ) . To correct this problem I have to unplug it from the wall outlet to cycle power . ( Really inconvenient ! )  
1	  I bought the VGA to RCA component RGB cable but it does not work at all . Waste of money and efforts . VGA to RCA Component RGB Cable - 1.8M - M / M  
1	  I bought this for my roku 2 . When I hook it up green flickering lines appeared in my TV screen and that ` s about it ! The cable is so skinny it can ` t handle the signal strength thus it doesn ` t work . Buyer beware !  
1	  I purchased these head phones to accompany my iPod . After wearing it 6 times , it does not accompany anything anymore . They cancel out noise in reasonable manner ( you can't expect miracles for this price ) , but it is so terribly uncomfortable . On my 7 hour flight I started off enjoying its noise-cancelling capabilities , but could not wear it for any longer than 2 hours . They are very tight and literally cause me headaches . It is just such a shame .. If I could only return these headphones and purchase the Sennheiser PXC 250 ( they are fab ! )  
2	  I gave it to my little bro for Christmas , and at the beginning he was eseptic but then he love it . It was difficult to make the mars laser eye to work but after a while we did it . Definetily it need and adult supervision for asembling and help to use at the beginning . We expend hours outside checking for stars and the moon .  
2	  Very easy to use and realiable product . Making it work was plug and play . I could even connect my office portable which has access to company intranet without any problem . Besides , the Norton Internet Security stop showing alerts about hacker attacks . I recommend it .  
1	  The idea of having access to my computer music collection anywhere in the house was very appealing . In my case , " anywhere " was the bedroom . With no LAN connection in the bedroom , wireless was perfect . Unfortunately , the Blaster must be connected to the computer acting as server by a usb cable ( supplied ) . During configuration , the Blaster console software searches for wireless networks . This means the server must be in range of a wireless access point . In my case the bedroom has wireless access but the server 's wireless access is marginal . ( I don't normally need wireless access at the server - I have a wired connection there ! ) This is inconvenient , but temporarily moving the Access Point got the thing setup initially . Unfortunately , the Blaster managed to " forget " its configuration settings several times over the 5 weeks I used it , requiring moving the thing back to the server , moving the access point and reconfig . For what ever reason , I couldn't even reconfigure this last time . Now it may well be that my problem was compounded be weak wireless access in the bedroom ( my wireless laptop reports weak access - but it does work ) . If the Blaster didn't work , I could understand it . I don't understand it forgetting its settings and the subsequent requirement to reconfigure . I really wanted this to work . It almost did but in the end I returned it . BTW , while the interface was not zippy , I found it adequate for the playlists I used ( about 100 songs out of a 3000 song library , YMMV ) . I also found it very convenient to have the entire user interface on the remote 's LCD . Bottom line : if you want this gadget , realize that you are an " early adopter " and you may have some problems . In the end , if it works for you - great ; if not , you too may be returning a Great Concept with a flawed implementation .  
1	  It 's a very nice and portable mouse , when I bout this mouse , I did for two things , the brand ( GE ) and price . but after a couple of months always happen that windows show me a message " a USB device it doesn't work properly " and after that mesage the mouse was freeze " . Now I Need to buy other one , but never a GE mouse .  
1	  The sound quality was impressive , but the right channel earphone failed within one week of use . An attempt to get a replacement or money back from the manufacturer was unsuccessful .  
2	  I bought these batteris for my Olympus camera . They work awesome as does the charger .  
1	  Received this purchase BEFORE time promised and in excellent condition . For first time digital camera users such as myself , this was easy to use and a good starting system .  
1	  The Netgear SC101 was one of the worst possible choices . Propriatary format and software are bad news please spend your money on something else .  
1	  The mouse works fine . The keypad is pretty much crap . The rubber anti-skid things on the bottom came off the first time I used it and the plus and minus keys no longer work . I haven't even tried all of the keypads functions yet to see if they work , as I 've only had it about 2 weeks . I 'm returning it . I do like however , that both the mouse and keypad have an auto off feature after a short period of not being used .  
2	  I tried these cameras right out of the box and experienced the same troubles others are having . But I came up with a work around . The first thing you need to do is straighten the antenna completely . Do not use the 45 and 90 degree catches . On my router / ap .. I installed ddwrt on my linksys wrt54gl and increased the transmit power on the router from 28 to 50 and set the router to reboot itself every morning at 4:00am . On each camera I bought a $ 5 appliance timer at the hardware store . ( the one 's people use to have their lights turn on and off when they aren't home ) and plugged the cameras in to the timers . Then set the timer to shut the camera off at 4:00am and turn itself back on a few minutes later . A nice low tech fix . Everything is 100 % rock solid now . Of course I had to jump through a couple of hoops to get everything working but hey , these things are cheap for what you are buying . I have not had a single problem with the cameras in months after the timers and router reboot were in place . Yes they are troublesome but are perfectly reliable with a little ingenuity . I would have given it 5 stars if it could push the images to an FTP server at a faster rate than 2 an hour . Also , I wish it was able to stream the video so I could embed it in a page using media player or quicktime . ohh well .  
2	  This works great . Instead of my bf constantly having to change his controller batteries , he plugs this in and is good to go . It takes a few seconds for the red light to come on to show it 's charging . Cord is a good length to . Longer then others i 've seen on amazon .  
1	  I loved this product for 4 months ( it does have lots of gadgets that I love ) and then .. for no reason at all my computer no longer recognizes it ! Rhapsody doesn't recognize it .. It 's turned into a ghost although I can see it ! I can play all of the songs that I owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled . I 've done a little research about the disappearing MP3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the H10 's and 1 other model I can't remember right now and iRiver can't figure it out ; although I 've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug .. So buy with caution ..  
2	  I did have to call tech support to assist in the installation process , but it only took ten minutes to walk me through the process . I installed this on a dell for my father-in-law and it works great .  
1	  I bought this from BestBuy and it was a piece of junk . I know it gets great reviews here , but the picture looked blurry and had a smeared look . Like someone put vaseline on the camera lens then filmed the movie . It was so poor . My friend has last years samsung 720p model , in the same community and same cable system as myself , and his picture looked 100 % better than this set . BestBuy then tells me to try another set , that this model might be a lemon , so I do that . Big mistake . The second sets picture was blurry , pixely , and had that noisy smeared look as well . My cable company checked the digital HD signal and said it was fine . I also used high quality HDMI cables and did everything to tweak the picture to no avail . I recorded the HD version of " King Of Queens " on my HD digital cable box , showed my buddies , and they were like , " That 's high def ? " . It looked like a noisy mess as well . Back this set went . I then bought the Toshiba 62HM196 , a 62 " ( bigger screen , AND ALOT BETTER picture ) 1080 DLP , and the difference is like night and day . The processor is MUCH better and even SD television looks pretty good . DVD movies are played with the Oppo DV-981HD DVD player , and the quality is amazing . I only wish I bought the Toshiba sooner . Consumer Reports rated it Excellent in HD and SD.I agree with them 100 % . Get the Toshiba .  
2	  This mounting arm is made very well . The overall quality is amazing and the installation is a breeze . The installation of the arm itself , took roughly 30 minutes . The only thing that I noticed was the mislabeling of mounting screws for the particular display I purchased . This was no big deal though since the package included an assortment of compatible screws . As far as the distance from the wall , it is as they claim , a little over 4 inches away , which may bother some .  
1	  I bought this stereo nearly a year ago and it was working great until a couple weeks ago . At first the CD player was having troubles , wouldn't recognize or play certain CDs ( regardless of type : original or burned CD ) . Then , one day , the sound just didn't work . No sound coming out of the speakers or the headphone jack at all . There are several online reports of this being a common problem with this model . Aparently it 's not worth the repair ..  
1	  DO NOT BUY NEW . DO NOT BUY USED . THIS IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF JUNK EVER MADE AND SOLD TO THE UN-SUSPECTING PUBLIC . THE SCANNER DOES NOT WORK . THEREFORE NO COPYING , NO FAXING , NO SCANNING . ONLY HALF-ASSED PRINTING . THE PAPER TRAYS STINK AND ARE USELESS . WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY TO DETER YOU FROM EVEN THINKING OF THIS PIECE OF CRAP .  
2	  I am often hesitant to purchase 3rd-party parts for important equipment , wary of compatibility and reliability . But this battery performs well , holds a charge for a good long time . I will wait to see what it 's lifetime proves to be ..  
1	  If you try to use a Microsoft Force Feedback joystick then forget about this simple cable with 2 connectors . I called Belkin and they assured me I will not have problem with my Microsoft Force Feedback . As usual today , they lied . I ordered from XP PASSPORT for about 3 dollars plus more than 8 dollars shipping and handling ( one man or woman handling from the shelf to the envelope ) . Now checking their return policy they refund the merchandise but not the shipping costs . As you reckon I am not going to pay a shipping to get 3 dollars back , even I doubt they give the money back . XP PASSPORT took a super long time to ship . So Belkin and XP PASSPORT belong to the same society . Shame on Belkin and shame on XP PASSPORT.I think Amazon should check close this guys .  
1	  From the 10 burns , 6 of the disc were bad . Must have been a bad batch of blanks .  
2	  I have just begun using an SLR camera . This was the right choice . It is simple to handle and does not have any confusing features . And best of all , it doesnt break . All around i think this camera was a good buy .  
2	  i received this camera as a gift and love it . i 'm a casual picture taker and i find that the quality of the pictures is very good overall . it 's easy to use .  
2	  The range of this router beats any G router I have used . It is easy to set up and maintain . I also like some of the advanced security features .  
2	  I originally purchased a 2640B two years ago after owning a 2540B ( no wireless ) . Because my wife bought a laptop , we needed WiFi . The 2640B is PACKED to the gills with all the bells and whistles and is pretty future-proof since it supports up to ADSL2 + out of the box . What 's up with AT & T ; pushing U-Verse and not faster speeds DSL speeds ? Hello ! Europe has had 24 Megabit DSL for YEARS ( and for 1/2 the cost of ALL US DSL providers ) ! Anyhow , setup was a breeze with my AT & T ; account , follow the wizard ( don't use the Auto setup , use Manual setup ) and plug in your info . I 've dealt with nearly all models of DSL modem AT & T ; foists upon the unsuspecting DSL customers and most of them stink to high heaven . This is a great model and works well if you have at least some understanding of your user name , password ( or AT & T ; ' s Network Password ) , and following on-screen directions . As for the reviews stating it is burning hot to the touch , nonsense . I leave mine on 24/7/365 and even on the hottest summer days , it warm , but not burning hot . I 've felt it after downloading hundreds of megs of data , still just warm , not hot . It 's unclear to me if the people who claim it gets hot are using proper ventilation . Anyway , I am buying another for my brother whose 2Wire modem is just a total POS and failing after only a year of use . Nuff said . UPDATE : 7/6/2011 : I just installed an updated version of this modem ( Hardware revision T1 , purchased from Newegg ) for my parents today and discovered some MAJOR useful information for you AT & T ; folks . At some point , AT & T ; started making users set a Network Password . Back when I got my DSL service , this was non-existent . In order to be able to use this modem , follow the directions posted by another person ( see below ) and note my changes ( CAPS ) . It will work , 100 % . 1 . Once AT & T ; turns on your DSL SERVICE , plug in the modem to your phone jack and make sure you get the SOLID green DSL light . 2 . Connect modem to computer with an ethernet cable OR WIFI . 3 . Open your browser ( Internet Explorer / OR FIREFOX ) and log in to the router admin ( address : [ .. ] user : admin password : admin ) . 4 . On the first page you see , de-select ' DSL Auto-connect ' and input ' 8 ' ( WRONG ! AT & T ; USES 0 , NOT 8) for VPI and ' 35 ' for VCI ( YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO THIS UNLESS YOUR DSL PROVIDER TELLS YOU TO CHANGE IT ! AT & T ; is 0 FOR VPI and 35 FOR VCI ! ( VPI depends on resident state : 0 or 8) THIS INFO IS WRONG ! THE FOLLOWING VPI / VCI INFO IS KNOWN TO BE CORRECT : AT & T ; - 0/35 , Bellsouth 8/35 and 0/35 , Covad - 0/35 , Earthlink - 0/35 , Verizon - 0/35 , Pac Bell - 8/35 , or 0/35 if you had your PacBell DSL installed between December 14 , 1999 and March 2000 , Southwestern Bell - 0/35 , Sprint - 8/35 , CANTV ( Venezuela ) - 0/33 , Cable & Wireless ( LIME ) Cayman Islands just changed from VPI : 0 VCI : 35 to VPI : 0 VCI : 38 ( added 08-24-09 ) ) . Click next . 5 . Select PPoE and leave the encapsulation mode on LLC / SNAP . Click next . 6 . Input attreg @ att . net as the username and attreg as the password . Click next . 7 . Leave the default settings . Click next . 8 . Leave the default settings . Click next . 9 . Enable wireless if you want . Click next . 10 . Click ' Save / Reboot ' . Exit the browser , wait for 2 min . 11 . Once that is done , reconnect to the network and navigate your browser to att . net / reg ( without the spaces , of course ) ( that is the only website you will be able to access ) . 12 . Follow the instructions to setup your personal username and password . 13 . You will need to install a file called ' ATTInternet .. ' ( NO ! YOU DO NOT NEED TO INSTALL ANYTHING ! USING FIREFOX , I DID NOT . ) 14 . Here it says it failed to recognize modem since its 3rd party . And also says to log in to modem and enter new user name and network password . 15 . Now log back to modem in a new browser ( address : [ .. ] user : admin password : admin ) and click on the ' Tools ' tab and the the ' System ' button . 16 . Click ' Restore Default Settings ' . ( THIS IS NOT NECESSARY . I DID NOT HAVE TO DO THIS STEP . ) 17 . GO BACK TO WHERE YOU ENTERED THE attreg @ att . net AND attreg info . CHANGE IT FROM attreg @ att . net TO YOUR NEW USERNAME < whateveryouchose @ att . net > AND PUT IT THERE . FOR PASSWORD , USE THE NETWORK PASSWORD YOU WERE GIVEN DURING THE ACCOUNT SETUP . WHEN YOU SEE IT WANTING TO SAVE TO WAN_000_2 ( OR SOME SUCH NAME ) , CHANGE THE 2 BACK TO 1 SO IT SAVES IT TO YOUR ORIGINAL SETUP . YOU 'LL LIKELY HAVE TO DO A SAVE / REBOOT . 18 . Now you should have internet ! Look for the green internet light . TEST YOUR CONNECTION . IF IT FAILS TO GO TO THE INTERNET , LOG BACK INTO YOUR MODEM AND REPEAT THE ABOVE . IF AT & T ; TELLS YOU TO ENTER att FOR THE PPoE SERVICE NAME , DON'T . IT MESSED THINGS UP I MY CASE . 19 . GO TO THE SECURITY SETTINGS OF THE MODEM AND CHANGE THE DEFAULT ADMIN PASSWORD TO SOMETHING ELSE ! GOOD LUCK !  
1	  I installed the stereo with this harness and thought all was ok until I turned off the car an the stereo kept playing . I had a friend look at it and we tried the harness with another stereo . It did the same thing . I went to bestbuy an bought a different harness and the stereo works fine .  
2	  I bought this as a gift for my dad for Father 's Day-he needed a new scanner for the Nascar races we go to each year . I think it 's almost better than the one he gave me ! We haven't used it yet - next race isn't until Labor Day weekend , but just by testing it out , it seems like a great scanner . It 's sleek and easy to carry around , and if you don't have earphones , the speaker on the scanner itself works really well . Great product for a great price !  
2	  excellent well made good quality material holds all the camera gear I need and with an Canon SLR 550D and separate flash As I said excellent .  
1	  We bought this card to use for a trip so we wouldn't have to use 4 different memory cards and the capacity suited us well for the trip . The problem came about when I tried to get photos off of the memory card and successfully got 30 or so pictures off before I started getting an error message and I couldn't copy my photos to my computer . I took the card out of my computer and re-inserted to fix the problem and when I opened the file , all of our photos were gone ! I ended up having to pay another $ 40 for a program to get the pictures back . This will be going in the trash can and I 'll be going back to Sandisk cards from now on .  
1	  this battery was totally ripe off . first of all its not toshiba its generic brand and does not last for 30 min .  
1	  They make 8-footer HDMI cable for $ 7 elsewhere by the tons ! Don't waste your money and fall for Monster 's trick , paying $ 75 !  
2	  I bought this HDMI cable to hook up my PS3 to my HDTV . It works great and definitely worth spending a couple bucks on than shelling out more money for a more expensive cable . I would recommend buying .  
2	  There is a rechargeable battery kit for this camera that 's sold separately . 2MPs in a tiny little camera , no protruding lenses or buttons , the touch screen / viewfinder is very convenient and easy to use , the picture quality is great , and the price is very reasonable . For a casual amateur photographer like myself , it 's ideal . I 'm very happy with my Toshiba PDR-T10 .  
2	  I bought this camera to take pictures of my family and friends . I have had if for more than one year , and it has performed above expectations under all conditions . The 1 minute video feature is great , and was an unexpected bonus ( since I didn't know about it when I bought it off Amazon ) . The camera works great with iPhoto and MacOS X. I bought a 512 MB card for it and so far it has been great . Both my father and my father in law have the previous Powershot S400 and they have had no problems with it . I figure at some point I 'll have to change the battery , because Lithium-Ions lose 20 % capacity per year , but so far it has worked flawlessly .  
1	  After going through the time and trouble of installing the Cruisader on my Cycle , and then to find out this thing doesn't work . Tells me that there is a " Com Error " . Not a happy camper ! Now I have to take it all off so I can return it . Did I mention , Not a happy camper !  
1	  What a piece of junk ! $ 20 sony 's are superior . Honestly I was expecting something very good but these were just were too nasaling giving off nothing but highs void of any bass . I spent a bit more and got some Shure 's . Much superior in total range and much more true in sound . God I was really blown away with how big of a pile of junk these ended up performing .  
1	  Purchased 4 of the little devils for family members . Within a month , 1 faltered ( wouldn't play unless smacked against something ) , then within 3 or 4 months , the second one has had the " upgrader " problem ( fixed ) , now it shows memory space taken up , but no music . In process of trying to fix now . The other 2 machines have performed flawlessly . When they do go , I will look elsewhere for a more durable product , and you should too !  
1	  I bought the more expensive - rw because a review had said you could delete and use space within the dvd . It might be my recorder but this is not so . When I delete mid dvd , my recorder says it will not increase capacity . Nor can I view on another player without first finaliZing , which is a pain since that gets rid of the thumbnail pictures and only shows time and date . And to delete select titles I have to unfinalize .. grr .. not so with + rw . These are much more expensive and the hassle factor is much greater .. back to + rws I go .  
1	  .. which ended up being about 6 months . After that the dvd laser only worked when it felt like it , which wasn't very often . Now it will only play cd 's since they use a seperate laser . I 'd suggest getting something else , unless you 're just wanting one to hold you over .  
1	  ALWAYS drops connections . I am on here right now because it just did a second ago . Every time it does ( 1x per day ! ) I have to manually unplug it . DO not but this .  
2	  I 've had a few of these - they 're great , but there 's been a tendency for the wires to split ( I think from cold weather ) . They 're compact and deliver great sound .  
1	  How many reviewers do you think were influenced by the success - and excellence - of Tartt 's first novel ? If the public was smart enough to pick out her first novel - and be right - might they not be correct about this one as well ? The first dozen of so pages were great , but the author just got too enchanted with her own word processor .  
2	  I have used this nearly every day for about 18 months at work , on the road , at parks and sometimes at home to secure my laptop . It has worked well for me . I have had no trouble with the combination changing as others on Amazon report . It can be a little sensitive to go off while you are typing , so you want the cable to be fairly loose between the laptop and alarm so vibrations aren't transferred through the cable . But I don't consider this a problem . My company accepts this as an alternative to physically securing ( anchoring ) the laptop to a piece of furniture which is often impractical when on the road or in many other situations . The cable is not long enough to physically anchor in most cases so you have to trust the alarm mechanism , but it works very well . The rubber / plastic cover for the Activate motion alarm button cracked but the button still works fine . If your company requires you to secure your laptop from theft at all times this is a more practical approach than trying to find physical anchor spots in meeting rooms , hotels , outdoors etc . See if your IT group will approve this device . It makes laptop physical security a lot easier and therefore more likely to be followed consistently .  
2	  The Zune is awesome . I find both the player and marketplace extremely user friendly . The player is very high quality as I have dropped it a few times and it still works perfectly . It integrates quickly and easily with my Xbox 360 and allowed me to free up tons of hard drive space that I had tied up with music . It is a great alternative to the very trendy Ipod .  
2	  In a word " fantastic " . Great picture on both analog and HD and the picture quality for DVDs is very very good . It was easy to connect to our Sony DVD surround sound system and cable system . Will certainly consider other Samsung products after our experience with this TV . Also , must give an A + to Eagle and their delivery service . They were professional in every way .  
2	  Not much in the way of directions for this but at least Axiom returned my call . It supports USB memory sticks up to 2 GB in size . Keep all your pictures in the same folder , it does not support multiple folders . The price was right , it looks good , and is relatively easy to operate .  
2	  This audio tape is great for recording even the most intense and powerful cds from the 80s . Of course , if you are listeing for it , you can probably tell the difference between the cd and the audio tape . However , the VERY SLIGHT difference is easy to tolerate considering the fact that by using tapes when you travel , you are protecting your cds from cd rot . For those of you who don't know about cd rot , it is caused by heat and moisture . Basically what happens is that heat and moisture corrode the cd . It turns the cd purple and renders it unreadable . In extreme cases , tiny holes are also present . The best way to combat cd rot is to keep your cds in a cool dry place . ( A drawer if possible . ) Keep your cds safe , and use this great audio tape to make travel friendly copies .  
2	  Another reviewer here with his facts mixed up about this cam 's preformance , said the Blair Witch was shot with the VX1000 ( almost same ability as vx2000 ) and that it has edge bleeding problems . Blair Witch was shot with a Hi-8 camcorder ( with some 16mm shots ) . Not with the Sony vx1000 or with any DV camera . Some claim the VX2000 is dated ( like sales people and others inexperienced types ) . While that may be partially truefor videographers , this is far from the truth for filmmakers . I own the newer Sony PDX10 , the best widescreen resolution than any other cam under 10 grand . But the VX2000 is Fantastic for low-light shooting ( 2lux ! ) while the new trv950 and pdx10 have over 1 megapixel per chip ( 3 times more than the VX ) , VX2000 's color performandce is virtually the same . The PDX10 and TRV950 are great for outdoor and well-lit shots . But neither come even close to the VX2000 for " low-light performance " , which is the most important feature for moody , cinematography-style lighting . It get 's down to VX 's larger 1/3 chips . For serious indoor filmmaking and if you 're set on using a 3ccd cam , then only consider a Canon XL1 or a VX2000 and nothing else . And forget the dvx100 in my opinion . It doesnt shoot widescreen at all . The DVX shoots in 24p for going out to film but with 25 % less resolution than xl1 or vx2k because it does not pick up any extra pixels in widescreen mode . If you need an interchangeable lens unit , go with the XL1 . But if not , you 'll save $ with the vx2000 . The VX2000 is still the best DV filmmaking prosumer machine out of the box .  
2	  Maybe Maxell has redesigned the cord since the previous set of reviews , but it is working great for me . I was very hesitant to buy the the cord because of the past poor reviews but figured it was worth giving a chance since all I wanted to do was be able to listen to Napster while running on my treadmill at home and my other alternatives were either 1 ) buy an MP3 player ( expensive ) or 2 ) crank up the volume on the computer loud enough to be heard over the motor of the treadmill ( not too nice for the rest of the family ) . I have the cord stretched to it 's full 20 ' length , from one room into another , with no loss in sound quality and the connections have all stayed tight and never popped loose ( something that has surprised me given the tension on the cord ) .  
1	  I was reading some of the reviews and i began to chuckle , at least i was not the only sorry one .. I was very happy in the beginning and made a few great mix cd 's for when i hit the road . ( that is the reason i purchased it ! ) I tried to use it recently and when i turned it on i heard this vroom vroom vroom sound from the recording side . The sound went away so i tried to make another cd , well YOU GUESSED IT , no good . Tried again wasted another cd . Such a shame . It 's not old at all . No need for me to get it fixed . It 'll probably cost more than the unit . SO BE AFRAID , VERY AFRAID .. SAD JUST SAD !  
2	  I am not a great photographer , but I have an eye for great photos . They are hard to take . I have taken over 400 photos with this camera . Outdoor photos : I took one set of 60 with my 14 year old daughter outside in 3 settings , and came up with a dozen great shots . Reflected light is a bit of a problem . But get your settings right , the camera will deliver . Photos were for head shot type enlargements of 8x10 . I will definitely be able to do this . I also messed up a lot of pictures with reflected light from my pool cover . I did not realize it was there in a 4th set a week later . With better light though , I got some incredible shot of kids in the pool , with dead still water motion caught in the images . Almost all this was in Program Mode , and the smallest autofocus area . Faces were gorgeous . Indoor photos : As others have mentioned , it can be a problem . We have an old 4 bulb standing candlebra , that had 60 watt bulbs . I got my distances right with some juggling of the chair and tripod distance , and came up with many outstanding photos . I then replaced the 60 watt bulbs with the same type 75 watt bulbs , and got a variable output switch for more control . What a mistake ! I could not get the yellow right at any , what I thought , light intensity . That was Program Mode , that I thougth I knew how to use . Then I took pictures of my fair skinned blonde wife in a different room , low light , automatic portrait mode with flash . HUH ? ! Great photo ! Went back to the other room , dimmed the lights and forced the flash the same . Great photo , great color ! I have not tried all the settings . I inadvertently proved indoor light sources vary a lot , and can easily ruin photos that you might blame on the camera . A fellow at work works a 2nd gig nights and weekends doing photography . He still relys on film , since it very true on color , and not so light sensitive . I think I agree with him that a comparably priced film camera is more capable with a skilled photographer . But with the costs of film and develoment to find out how you did add up , and not till days later . With instant review , you keep shooting , make an adjustment , and shoot some more . You get great photos . With patience , time to learn the camera , and a steady hand , this camera can and will deliver great pictures . Being digital , you save on film and development . Even more just printing those you want , and put the rest on CD or on your computer . For those folks who don't like the flash of the FZ5 , they need true white bulbs for their house , or have semi-gloss paint that is tinging color in the room , or something other problem the camera is revealing . Years ago I painted my living room in a light beige ( California Sand ) color semi-gloss . Every picture came out looking sepia-toned from reflected light off the walls and ceiling . That was a different camera , and film . Back to the FZ5 . My nephew took about 60 pictures as if it was in instant camera . Most came out terrible . He did not hold it steady , did not check light sources , did not catch good looks on people . But most cameras can't fix the issues a user of the camera who does not know what he is doing . If you can hold a camera steady , wait for a beautiful shot in the viewfinder , or LCD , the camera will capture it . You will also be able to have outstanding enlargements . Oh . I also knocked over the tripod , and the camera hit the concrete pool deck putting slight scrapes near the viewfinder . ! @ # $ % ^ . Nope , camera still works fine . I bought the FZ5 for : 12X OPTICAL Zoom for good home distance shots and great portraits NOT standing in someone 's face . Image Stabilization for help with blurred images . 5 MP for film quality enlargements . Combining this with the zoom works really well . Very good shutter speed for the price range and feature set . Very good color accuracy for the price range and feature set . Trying to stay near $ 500 . Added plus , a nice little lens hood . I selected based on cameras of similar features I reviewed on both Amazon . com ( somewhat helpful ) and ww . imaging-resource . com ( very helpful ) . The latter includes nearly identical pictures of the same items with each camera and extensive , and identical reviewing standards . Sample lighting seems to vary just a little bit from camera to camera , but the reviewer I 'm sure at least used consistent lighting . I will get a 2nd battery , an A / C Adapter , and a basic set of lens filters . But no external flash . If you want that , the FZ20 should be your pick . Buy with the idea of using it heavily in the trial period . For me , I think the FZ5 is a keeper .  
2	  Worked . I have a Dell Inspiron 8600 with Linux Ubuntu Mint Edition . But could have used an indication of capacity somewhere on the thing .  
2	  Excellent features on this DVD player . The remote is a little confusing , but that is only due to the fact that I didn't read the manual . Most electronic remotes are intuitive , but the one supplied with this DVD player has a small learning curve . I would definately recommend this DVD player to anyone . Excellent piece of electronics .  
1	  The package I received is totally different than the picture shown on this page and when I tried using the battery it was already dead . Guess that 's why they are selling it for so cheap with free shipping . You get what you pay for !  
1	  The sound quality of these earphones is really good . I was very pleased with my purchase until about 4 months ( 1 month past warranty ) into them , when I noticed bare wire on the cord in two places . The cord is very cheaply made and doesn't seem to stand up to the normal wear and tear . I love the sound quality , but the cord problem can present a serious problem .  
1	  Bought new and was very expensive . The device was riddled with problems mailed it back to JVC for repair and it eventually stopped working for no reason !  
2	  Great sound but I have't gotten the part that goes in my ear to be comfortable yet  
1	  The microphone quit working after one month so that the person on the other could not hear me . I made sure the plug was pressed in hard into the jack , but no luck . I tried another headset and it worked ok so I know the phone and jack are working . This headset was great while it worked , bummed it quit working .  
2	  I just want to start from saying that this is not $ 1000 or more DSLR camera so I did not expect to see high quality pictures when I first bought it . However after taking few images in full sun I was pleased with image quality taking into account small lens and price of the camera ( I paid $ 56 for refurbished one with 90 day Nikon warranty ) . All pictures came out sharp with true colors . I did not see single one that was blurred . Macro worked fine too . In low light condition story is a little different . It appears that flash fires always with the same power so you need to keep approximately 5 " to 6 " from the subject all the time to avoid under or overexposed pictures . I got better results ( in low light condition ) using museum mode ( BSS is on ) . There are lots of things I like about this camera : size , metal body , lens built inside , nice features like 4 assists modes , 15 scene modes , D-lighting , picture editing , voice recording , date imprint , color options , excellent movie modes and many , many more . Everything works as it should ( I checked them all ) . It is easy to use without reading manual ( may be to me becasue I own Coolpix 5700 ) . I could wish only for manual mode . I read a lot of complaints about blurry pictures , noise etc . One can set ISO to low value and use tripod to get good pictures . Do not expect that tiny lens to pass enough light so camera sets low ISO and short exposure time avoiding blurry / noisy pictures . I do not think that you can show me better camera in that size and in this price . There is really nothing not to like about this camera , you just need to read manual and experiment with settings to get good results .  
2	  First , I 'll start off with saying that this teapot / set is amazing and worth every penny . Second , as a huge tea buff ( but not a snob ) I have to say that the tea is better than the price implies . It 's not obscenely expensive , nor will it brew the best cup you 've ever had , but for people who drink tea as a recreation and not some creepy obsession-hobby , it 's great . It 's not as strong as you 're probably expecting , but all flowering tea is this way , due to how the bulb is designed . You just have to steep it longer , is all ( 10 or so minutes will yield a tea as strong as regular old stuff takes 5 minutes to reach . ) so simply adjust steeping time accordingly . Third , I have to say that ALL of the tea in them is expired . Primula stopped making the set after making a ton of them , and all the sets were with tea dated to expire 12/30/10 . Not their fault that stores / sellers still have kits . but they still make the tea ! And here 's the good thing : bed , bath , and beyond carries the set ! < .. > Just use the " find in a store " and find a nearby store that has it . If you can't find a store with the kit , you can order it online , but bear in mind that the tea may not be as good as it could be , and you might want to order some more tea separately as well . If you do find it in a store , go there and pick this thing up ! just open the box in store to check for cracks ( this broscillate is very strong , but thin enough that a hard knock can crack it , like anything else made from broscillate ) and swap out the expired tea for one of the tubes of un-expired tea they have on the floor . It 's the same stuff , just un-expired . And if green tea isn't your thing , your B , B & B ; may have the " assorted " flavor pack , or an earl grey pack available to swap in as well . On to a review of the pot itself : It 's an excellent pot , particularly for not being bottom-spouted . The broscillate is strong and very thermally efficient . you can boil water in the pot , ON THE STOVE , and the handle will not get hot . The lid , on the other hand , is thin , so it gets SCORCHING . Just be careful with the lid when you pour , it gets hot , fast . A regular old teatowel on the lid ( let 's face it , all teapot lids get hot ) alleviates this . The top-pour spout doesn't dribble at all , is very well designed , and only the last few dribbles from the pot require inverting the thing . It 's not a hassle at all . Overall , I bought this set for the pot , and have been nothing less than perfectly happy with it ! It is very thin ( not a fault , really . There 's a reason all vessels made from this material are thin , ) however strong it may be , so be gentle with it . With regards to the infuser , it 's good , and very attractive , but not very efficient . If you want to use very fine , loose tea , I suggest a regular old $ 2 mesh ball . But if you have larger-leaf tea , such as gunpowder style , it works brilliantly . And if you plan on using the tea flower multiple times , I suggest placing it in the infuser .  
1	  It lasted less then 2 months . Never again .  
1	  .. but it slowly faded ! It made terrible sounds and broke quickly . I have had many turntables and they all worked well . For some it may work but I reccomend researching this buy further ! ( unless you can afford it )  
1	  Print quality is fine , but holy moly , you can maybe get 100 pages out of each cartridge . I 'm changing them very frequently so overall the cost of each page is much higher than it should be . I wouldn't be surprised to find out that these 92 's are only used in low cost printers , as HP is probably using their low output to subsidize the cost .  
1	  After reading all the glowing reviews about the great sound , I ordered this as opposed to the JBL , figuring the only thing that 's missing is remote control . The sound quality is nothing to write home about . It turns out that there are no miracles , and you get what you pay for . If you 're looking for an inexpensive dock that sounds better than a clock radio , but not by much , then get this . But don't think you 'll be able to use this to provide music at a party , unless it 's in a nursing home .  
2	  This kit is excellent . It 's the second one I have , one for home and one for my office so that I don't have to " tote " these items back and forth .  
2	  I bought two pairs of the PNY Optima 's , one for my Dell E510 and the other for my Dell E521 . When I opened the Dell E510 ( Intel Processor ) , I realized the " Channel A " memory slots ( DIMM_1 & DIMM_2 ) were not next to each other but were physically separated by a " Channel B " memory slot ( DIMM_3 ) . If it weren't for the white securing clips and previous matched pair of 512MB memory I might not have known what was the " Channel A " memory slots . So I moved the preexisting matched pair of 512MB ( PC2-4300 533MHz ) memory from the " Channel A " slots to the " Channel B " slots and installed the matched pair of 1GB ( PC2-5300 667MHz ) PNY 's into the " Channel A " slots . Once I started the computer , I instantly wanted to make sure the computer recognized the memory and went into the BIOS . I did this since I moved the preexisting memory AND I installed new memory with a higher clock speed capability ( 667MHz versus 533MHz ) . I had to trust that the PNY would work , but I had to verify the motherboard would work with them also . Thankfully the motherboard recognized all the memory and did not show any conflicts . And I resumed the boot in to Windows and no issues there either ; it went straight to the Windows login screen . When I opened the Dell E521 ( AMD Processor ) , I saw that the " Channel A " memory slots were actually next to each other as I expected with the previous matched pair of 512MB ( PC2-5300 667MHz ) memory . As before , I moved the preexisting matched pair of 512MB memory from " Channel A " to " Channel B " and installed the PNY 's into " Channel A. " Again , I instantly went into the BIOS to make sure the computer recognized the memory . The computer did recognize the memory and so I resumed the boot in to Windows . However , this time on the Dell E521 it didn't get to the Windows login screen . And after about 30-minutes of moving the memory around I figured I needed to see if I could even get Windows to recognize the memory . So I put the memory in how I wanted it , PNY 1GB 's into " Channel A " and preexisting 512MB 's into " Channel B " and booted into the Windows Safe Mode by pressing " F8 " multiple times after the BIOS screen . Low and behold , Windows gave me a " New Hardware Found " dialog box and indicated it was memory . Therefore , I rebooted to get out of the " Safe Mode " and Windows went straight to the Windows login screen . So now both PC 's are working wonderfully with a total of 3GB of memory and both are using the memory at different speeds ( 533MHz versus 667MHz ) without issues . Note : I moved the memory because the computer tries to utilize the " Channel A " memory first and having a larger amount of memory there means my computers would run " better " even though all the manufacturer instructions explicitly told me not to do it . In addition , what happened on the Dell E521 could have been narrowed down to just the addition of memory as a single change versus multiple changes like I made .. maybe they knew what they were talking about . ;-)  
1	  Worst box ever .. I am switching back to my old Directv TIVO HD Box . Do not waste your money ..  
1	  Can someone tell me what boards can I buy for this memory ?  
2	  I absolutely love this mouse . It fits comfortably in my hand . Just the right size for travel . The functionality is not too sensitive and I like the fact that you can interchange the function assigments . I also like the scroll to enlarge feature . A lot of times the print on articles is very tiny . I rate this mouse a " 5 " !  
1	  I used this bag for one year to carry my 13.3 " , 4.2 lb laptop ( without the charger ) and occasionally a textbook ( never more than one - there wasn't enough space ) . It served me well enough at the time . The shoulder strap was comfortable , and the separate front pocket was easy to access and large enough to hold my other stuff . The downside : one day , while walking to class , the D-shaped ring on the side broke and the shoulder strap released . Absolute disaster ! Sure , the bag is well padded , but it does nothing to protect a laptop after it plunges 3 feet onto concrete . My laptop was in bad shape : there was a hole in the casing on the corner where it had impacted the ground . Also , my wireless internet on-off switch stopped working . Unfortunately , it had gotten stuck in the " off " position . I called Targus customer service and received nothing more than a hard-to-hear ( overseas ) service rep reciting the company 's mission statement . I asked to talk to a higher-up and was denied . Later I received an email offering to replace my bag , as per the warranty . I didn't take them up on the offer , nor will I be entrusting my laptop ( back to normal now , after a $ 400 + repair ) to a Targus product . Bottom line : I can't recommend this product to anybody . Current owners , check your D-rings ; mine were separated in a very inconspicuous line .  
1	  This is a very attractive , feature laden electronic device . It has very straight forward easy to understand and use features and controls . It appears to be well designed and constructed and claims to offer loads of fun for picture taking , shooting videos and playing mp3 's . These are the thoughts that will go through your head when you first handle the MC3 . However .. There is a dark side to this picture ( pun intended ) . In my opinion one would be better off donating the money you would spend for this to your favorite charity instead . This device should have never been released for sale . Kodak has truly hit an all time low with this product . Simply put , the pictures are of such poor quality that they lack description . The same holds true with the video . As far as an mp3 player ? Well , first you are going to have to figure out how to put them on the unit . The software isn't compatible with WinXP for one thing . Tech support was no help ( for me ) I finely broke down and purchased a cf card reader / writer which seemed to work ok , but when the mp3 's were played back on the unit the display showed no song information at all ! The volume has to be turned up all the way to even hear them ! And there is very little difference in sound quality between the various EQ settings ! The only redeeming quality this unit seems to have is it 's appearance . And boy it sure does look nice sitting next to my trash can !  
1	  I liked the fact that the walkman was very light and easy to carry around , but the reception is just terrible . I was able to listen to only one radio station ( sometimes ) . The earphones are a pain to use and the foam covers came off very easily . I lost one of them soon after purchasing the item . Don't bother buying this product .  
1	  I ordered this item from this company and did not received all that was promised . It said that it had a charger and there was none and a case and they did not send any . I do not recommend this company or this item .  
1	  I ordered this item from this company and did not received all that was promised . It said that it had a charger and there was none and a case and they did not send any . I do not recommend this company or this item .  
2	  This is not the newest model on the market , however it works and priced right . Now I wait to see how long it lasts .  
2	  Tried other chargers but this one is the best by far . Good price and problem free .  
2	  It 's easy to use . It 's light weight . It takes great pictures too ! At first , I was disappointed because of the plastic body , but I later enjoyed the fact that this is a light weight camera . I also enjoy the automatic focusing and the easy film loading . The 55N has a built in flash that pops up automatically when the light is not sufficient or if extra light is needed to soften a picture . I would recommend the additonal purchase of a " circular polaring filter " because it greatly enhances your photos . You can find one on Amazon . This is a sofisticated camera that is easy to use and has made me a better photographer . I highly recommend this camera .  
2	  I am rating these earbuds under 2 categories : 1 ) Sound is fairly good but can have higher Fidelity . " Highs " are clean , " Mids " are ok ( doesn't provide full range but decent enough ) , and " Lows " are clean . For optimal effect , I would tune your equalizers in your hardware to your liking . 2 ) Comfort is very important especially for earbuds bc you are going to be sticking them inside ur ears for a prolong period of time . The material used for these earbuds are higher quality than most that I have used . The rubber / plastic ear inserts aren't the thin / flimsy kind where it will rip in a couple of months . It is more rigid and stays in my ear comfortably . Earbuds are also very light weight so it doesnt feel like they weigh you down . Overall , these are definitely worth my $ 20 for the quality that I am getting .  
1	  the product description should state what the packaging does , that the unit only provides 500mA at 12V . i wouldn't have purchased if i had known it was so puny . :(  
2	  like many other driver ed instructors i need a good way to talk to my students with helmets on in loud racing cars . the last 2 way intercom i had was 3 times the price of this one and the mic in the head set broke on that one in no time . i have used this one three time now and though it as cheap in price and quality it does work just fine for my needed . so my thinking is if i need to buy a new one ever year it 's no big deal at all . my old one only lasted 2 1/2 years and i went thru 4 head sets . i use rechargeable batterys with these intercoms because you do go thru batterys quight fast if you don't . as for the FM radio part of this system well all i have to say about that is any radio of this type is nothing but a joke . it is not better or worse than my walkman of the old days . i can't say how it would do on a motorcycle but for my needs and 60 bucks it 's a sore dick deal . you just can't beat it !  
2	  Every time , I used this microphone and heard nice modulation from my friends . It is has big gain and good frequency response and I like red color devil designing . I recommend this microphone for HAM radio mobile .  
2	  Product works great . Plug & play . Did not need to use the installation CD included with the product . I am using it for Skype with Vista Home Premium 64 bit operating system and Plantronics 640 headset . Plugged the IOGEAR adapter into my PC . The PC immediately recognized the adapter and started installing the driver . I then clicked on the Bluetooth icon in the system tray and added my Plantronics 640 device . Couldn't have been any easier . Only problem I haven't figured out yet is why I can't go back and forth on the Plantronics 640 between my cell phone and PC / Skype . Can't seem to dual pair the headset with the PC and the cell phone . But that might be a limitation on the Plantronics headset , not sure . The Plantronics 640 works great paired alone with the IOGEAR adapter . Now I can ditch the corded , bulky headset I was using for Skype . Would definitely recommend the product .  
2	  I got this laptop when I returned to college . I absolutely love it ! I love the sleek design , and easy to use keys . I spend many hours a day on it , and it never seems to overheat .  
1	  One star is generous . Forget this piece of junk , it is not worth even a 10th of the price . Spend $ 10.00 more and get an iPod shuffle with 10X the space . Why this is still being offered is beyond me . They don't even make smart media cards anymore ! Please tell me this is a joke .  
2	  I received the Sony RM-AV2100 for Christmas .. I 'm very happy with the unit and felt compelled to fill everyone in . The first thing I did was programmed the unit for my current A / V equipment .. a Mitsubishi TV and VCR , Pioneer CD / DVD player , amplifier , General Instruments cable box and Sony Mini-Disc player . The instructions include the universal codes for a ton of manufacturers . This process ( after reading the instructions , of course ) took less than 20 minutes . Next , I taught the unit to recognize my Replay TV . This was as simple as hitting a key on the Sony RM-AV2100 and then hitting a corresponding key on the Replay TV remote ( while the Sony unit doesn't have a pre-defined DVS ( digital video server ) selection I was able to treat the Replay TV as " VCR 3 " ) . Getting the unit to synch up with my Replay took about 15 minutes . Finally , the bells and whistles that I really wanted were installed . The unit comes with 3 " macro " keys which allow you to execute up to 16 commands with the push of one button . I programmed key 1 to turn EVERYTHING on / off . Key 2 turns on the TV , Amp and Replay unit and then tunes to CNBC ( in addition to coffee , Squawk Box is my morning addiction ! ) . I haven't programmed Key 3 yet . This process took less than 10 minutes . So , why did I rate the unit only 4 stars ? Here are my complaints : - The LCD pad is smaller than I 'd like . It would have been nice if they had increased the size of the LCD pad and reduced the size of the hard wired buttons - It doesn't have a button / template which supports digital video servers ( Replay , TiVO ) directly . As a result , I have to remember how I mapped the keys that are unique to the video server ( skip commercials , replay last 7 seconds , etc . ) Now , what I love : - Excellent instruction manual . Take the time to read through it quickly then follow the step-by-step instructions the first time you program a particular function . You 'll get the hang of it in no time . - Perfect overall size .. not too big but not so small that it 'll get lost . - Back-lighting is very good ( though I 'd like an LCD contrast button ) . - Very responsive . It executes the commands much faster than my regular remote . For instance , moving between selections on an on-line programming guide is much quicker .  
2	  It is a very solid product , not looks like cheap plastic , and I trust Belkin as a reliable power-bar provider , works very well .  
2	  just as described what a wonderful gift this will make hope they like it they have wanted one for a while  
2	  I ordered this with the camera and was surprised as just how handy it is . The small carabiner on the back makes it easy to attach to a belt loop and the velcro / zipper close also makes it easy to grab those shots you normally miss . It 's especially handy when hiking with a pack or kid on your back .  
1	  I am writing this to clear some of the reviews for products I have bought through Amazon . This is an old product but when I bought it , it never worked to satisfaction . So much so , that I never really used it and should have returned it . But I guess this is now not even offered for sale .  
1	  Although the frame itself looked good , it didn't work . After calling customer service , I decided to return it for a full refund . I ordered a Koday Easy Share SV11 .. which worked great . Do your homework and look at all reviews and specifications before ordering any frame . In my opinion , you can't beat Kodak 's frame .  
2	  Ordered this camera because it seemed like an amazing deal , for the kit with the lens and the dateback body . Package arrived , it 's the standard body in the kit . Be aware of false advertising / very expensive typo ..  
2	  If you were unable to get sharp pics with this camera , then you 've done something wrong . Pics are VERY sharp . I 'm formerly a professional photographer who has used some of the best cameras ever built . The Z1 is a CONSUMER camera packed with a lot of features for the money . Construction is fair and this is not a TOUGH unit like a Canon G3 or G5 . The lens is of very good quality at this price point and can deliver crisp images fully zoomed in . I 've zoomed in to 40X with the digital kicked in and gotten sharp images HANDHELD . But the truth is that even with image stabilization extreme zooming is hard to keep steady . The fellow who said you need 4 mp or more clearly knows little about cameras . You can crop fine at with a 3.2 , unless you have a printer that does posters ! Focus works great on manual settings as well , but the camera lacks a focus light which can give it some trouble . The Z1 can also shoot good quality video , above and beyond what most others can do . It has a great display , among the best I 've seen and is easily balanced . B & H ; sells them every day for 329.00 and it has utterly replaced my G5 for day to day shooting . It 's an amazing value . I 'm sure Minolta will come out with a better version soon .. and I 'll probably buy it !  
2	  I always do a lot of research before I invest in a piece of technology such as this and I always half expect for all of the customer reviews to be misleading and I get a piece of junk , but nothing bad has come out of this camera so far . Pictures are gorgeous , video is better than what I expected in low light and phenomenal outdoors or in other good lighting . Size is one of the reasons I picked this over the 750 series , because it 's just that much more stylish and convenient . Even with theCanon PSC-55 Deluxe Leather Compact Case for SD430 , SD500 , SD550 , SD600 , SD630 , SD700IS , SD800IS , SD850 IS , SD900 , SD950IS & SD870IS Digital Camerascase I bought for it ( apparently it 's not advertised as fitting the SD1000 series but it fits like a glove , trust me ) , it fits reasonably well into my pants pocket . I might try the case that 's specifically for the SD1000 , just because it would be that much more compact . To be honest , it bulges out little more than my ancient cell phone so it 's not a problem carrying it around every time I go out with friends . I also purchased theKingston , 4 GB SD Secure Digital Flash Memory Card SD / HC ( Retail Package ) because I work for a certain technology retailer and I got it for about $ 5 more than the 2 gig version with employee discount . 4 gigabytes is more than enough memory . Formatted , it holds just over 30 minutes of very impressive quality video ( seems to hold more if you record shorter videos instead of one 30 minute video ) and just over 2000 pictures at 3072 x 2304 resolution . Overall , more than pleased with this purchase . With the camera , accessories ( case and 4GB card ) , and a 2 year service plan , I was right at $ 250 . Very good investment if you can find a deal that good . The only thing I regret is not buying the black version , but it 's not a big deal at all . Besides , silver hides dirt better ;) . Pros : Price , size , style factorBrilliant photo quality ( in my unprofessional opinion ) Great video qualityImpressive bundled softwareCons : Didn't buy the black version .. not really a con .. None at the moment  
2	  They aren't super high-quality , but for the price it will get the job done . Packaging and condition upon arrival were acceptable .  
2	  I bought this printer from amazon . com . Nicely arrived before scheduled time . Great photo printing . Copying is very cool , with features like both color or b / w . Really enjoying it . Both side printing kind of works sometime . These printers are great product for such a low price , because they planned to make money from the ink you buy . They have chips in their ink catridges to avoid you going after market catridges for refills . If you do choose go after market catridges , changing the chip from old oem catridge into after market catridge is little bit harder . But you will loose nice elegant feature , monitoring ink level functionality from the computer . And you have start monitoring ink level manually atleast once a each week .  
1	  You would be better off purchasing a bridge in Brooklyn , than buying this cable . Actually , if the former sounds appealing to you , let me know . I know a guy .. Digital signals by definition are as steady stream of 1 's and 0 's . Any cable that transmits those ones and zero 's at ALL is indistinguishable from any other such cable . There is no difference in the " purity " of a 1 or a 0 . It is either one or the other , you can't have a digital signal that transmits * almost * a 1 . Search Amazon for any standard Cat-5 cable and you 'll save yourself $ 495 on a product that will be * just * as good as this one . Give the difference to charity or spend it on something truly worthwhile . Needless to say , I 'll be very careful to never purchase any Denon products . They really should be ashamed of themselves .  
1	  I left behind my D-link DWL 132 ( 108 mbps ) when I was on vocation which work great for me over a year . After read all the reviews , I decided to give this one ( WUSB54GS a try ) . The signal range was dispointed ( D-Link DWL132 have much better range ) . Setup with push button with Linksys Secure Easy Setup is easy with Linksys router , BUT I lost connection on my other Laptop PC which is not Linksys wireless adapter . I go back to re-setup my laptop than this adapter on desk top lost connection because of changing setting on the linksys router . One way or another , I spend 4 hours still unable to make both adapters work with Linksys 54g router .  
1	  I fell in love with the media features on this pc . I am not a computer whiz so I thought I was making a good decision when I purchased this at a B & M ; store . I was thrilled with all the media features the salesman pointed out . I was happy with the purchase until little things added up up to a major problem . This system is very easy to set up which I loved . I really enjoyed the built in wi-fi card , tv tuner capability , and media control keys ( burn cd / dvd with the press of one button with additional software ) . It has a great card reader , accepting a lot of different types . Also , I really liked the sleek look of the system since it is out in the open . It was much faster then my old HP 2005 Media Center . After using an external drive to copy over media files from my old pc , I discovered the limited amount of space on this hard drive . I should have made a point of knowing before purchasing . This system might be billed as a " Media Center " but if you have an extensive music library and / or video collection , this system is not your best choice . This is fine is you want a basic system or have an external drive to store your media files . I kept it instead of returning as I like the familiarity of HP Media Centers but this will be my last one . My old pc had Windows XP and this one has Vista , which went wonky on occasion , especially when trying to install software . Only 2 usb ports are placed in the front and the other 4 are in the back . I purchased an usb hub to address this but it would have been nice having it the other way round , 4 up front and 2 in back . My biggest complaint was that the system started to crash . I called HP customer support ( India ) but they could not help me unless I paid a non-refundable fee of $ 99.99 since it was a little over a year . Since they could not guarantee to solve my problem , I decided against this but did request a supervisor . He was on break and had left the building so why didn't I call back some other time ? HUH ? After several more calls to find a more helpful rep , I was advised it was an operational software issue so I should try Microsoft . A call to Microsoft told me there were three options since it was after a year from purchase : ( 1 ) call HP since they installed it and were best able to help me [ already tried this route ] ; ( 2 ) go online for support [ if I could go online , I wouldn't need their help ] ; and ( 3 ) pay $ 59.00 for tech support which although credit info would be taken , only would be charged if they could assist me . Bottom line , both companies blamed each other which doesn't help the customer but Windows did have a better offer . I was not completely happy with this system from the start so it 's my own fault for keeping it past 30 days . However , I think a pc should work for longer then a year without crashing ! This system was not cheap so why would I buy another HP ? especially when factoring in their poor customer service . I have gone back to my old pc while I search for a replacement . Apple is starting to look good . I hear Macs are worth the price paid .  
2	  After pricing this part with various vendors , none of which could verify that it would actually fit , I chose the lower priced insert here & received it 2 days ahead of schedule & it fit perfectly . Thank you for your prompt service .  
2	  I work in an IT department for a County Government , and we use a 5100cn as our primary printer . We have had it in production since early September and still have not had to replace any cartridges . I have not once seen a paper jam occur on this printer like another user said , and we printer on almost any type of paper you can think of ( Stand . , Legal , Envelopes , Labels , Transparencies ) . It really is a commercial-grade product with a consumer-grade price . As far as Dell Tech Support goes , we primarily deal with Dell for almost all of our needs - servers , desktops , printers , etc . - and we have never had a problem with getting service when needed . We almost always purchase the Gold upgrade for support , and I can tell you that they will make problems right no matter what . Besides , what are we reviewing here , the printer , or the support ?  
2	  I 've had this player for a few months now . It 's size , ease of use and expandibility are great features . I use is as much as possible .  
2	  This product is excellent for the price . The software is standard Windows media player . I used the latest media player without any problem . The hardware interface such as the touch-screen type buttons work well . Over all , it is a good buy for storage size and well constructed piece of hardware . It only supports USB 2.0 . USB 1.1 is too slow to transfer a huge amount of MP3 files anyway . If you do not have USB 2.0 , buy a USB 2.0 PCI card and install it in your computer . It is worth it .  
1	  Pro . 1 . The product has good features . Con . 1 . The product will not work long . 2 . The company has poor customer service . 3 . When , there is a problem , they will expect you to ship it to them at your own expensefor either a repairor for a replacement that does not have the same featuresas the one you originally bought . I recommend avoiding Cyberhome products altogether . It 's worth it to pay more for a reputable & dependable company'sproduct .  
1	  Ordered the batteries pictured in August and received duogreen batteries instead . Now , I 'm all about being green , but that 's not what I ordered and paid for and they haven't worked properly since installed . Handsets hold a charge for less than 20 minutes ! So , less than 6 months later I 'm shopping for replacements - something I should have done the minute they arrived .  
2	  I bought this simply to protect my new 14.1 ' Sony Vaio from dust and to have padded portable storage . I wasn't expecting too much for $ 20 , but I was pleasantly surprised . The material is high quality and the padding inside is very nice . Since my notebook is smaller than the case , it helps me also trasport my charger . Good deal for only 20 smackers .  
2	  This printer has been working flawlessly for me for at least five or six years now . Sure , it 's a little noisy , but the noise is not excessive for a printer of its size . The output is extremely consistent , and that 's a big plus . The major drawback to the printer is that it will disable itself when it feels the toner is too low . At first , like a dummy , I would replace the low toner cartridge . But then I found out you can put the printer in a diagnostic mode which allows the printer to keep printing even when a toner cartridge is low . Once I learned how to do that , I could keep printing for months . At least a fourth of my printer 's life cycle was spent printing in diagnostic mode . Then I found out you can go into the printer 's setup menu and override the printer 's settings , allowing you to print until a toner cartridge literally runs out . This is the only way to get your value out of the cartridges .  
2	  Produces a great picture . Very thin so much so that I took off one star as with my clumsy hands I find it somewhat difficult to hold steady . It will fit in your pocket and you will not even know it is there . However , it has a steady feature that overcomes this problem . I use it mostly for point and shoot but it does have manual controls over the camera . You use the charging cradle with a USB cord to connect to your computer and it does not connect directly wit a USB cord . Holds an extremely long battery charge . The large 2.5 " viewing screen takes up nearly the entire back of the camera and you will need to be somewhat careful not to mar the screen . Mine came with a clear protector for the screen that just adheres to the screen . I have not tried it in the movie mode yet . This is perhaps the smallest 8.1mp camera on the market . Well made but the instruction manual sucks but if you are into digital camera 's you will figure it out . You can buy a car charger if you feel the need . I give it 4 stars but have only used it a week .  
1	  the new updated driver available online still does not work for vista ! lenovo gave this webcam away with the purchase of my new laptop because they didn't think they would lose money because they knew it would not work anyway even with the supposed new drivers available online ! what a joke ! i hate being the " duped " consumer . i 'm buying a $ 20 webcam from the local computer store and happily throwing this lenovo piece of XX in the garbage .  
1	  This item is falsely advertised as an Apple product . It is NOT made by Apple . It is a cheaply made imitation . The pieces don't fit together quite right and the charging chord is not able to plug all the way into the charging block . When the charger is plugged in it emits a VERY loud VERY high pitched buzzing sound that my entire household finds unbearable . This charger is not worth your time or money !  
2	  I bought this product mainly for its capability to read SDs and USBs . I put movies , mainly children 's movies , on SD cards and let the children watch them in their bedrooms or in the car while traveling . The movies are ripped in the Divx format . The only problems I have encountered are : 1 . it sometimes would unexpectedly terminate the movie before the end , 2 . if I try to fast forward the movie , it sometimes freezes up and a reboot is required . However , this may have something to do with the speed of the memory chips instead of being the problem of the machine , 3 . It does not work with SDHC cards such as cards of 8 GB.I have bought two of them in the past . The battery of one gives me about 1 hour and 15 minutes of viewing time . The other one only works for about 1/2 hour . Overall , I give it 4 stars . Its strong points are : 1 . very reasonable price , 2 . works with SD cards and USB and with many video formats .

2	  Great purchase for the price . Cables work fine with everything . No need to buy monster cables at all anymore !  
2	  Let me start by saying that if ur into listen to Salsa or Merengue these are flat out INCREDIBLE , they just seem to be soo compatible with that style of music . That 's what gives me the WOW factor . Now when it comes to RAP , thats when it tends to become inconsistant . Some songs are right on point but it seems like most songs sound either too low or the bass is too distorted . The low volume is evident when out in the hustle and bustle of the city , buses , trains , sirens , crackheads , etc . But seriously if ur into the Latin music TWO THUMBS WAY UP , RAP is hit or miss . Overall not bad for the price I dont regret getting them I just wished the Rap tracks had the same feel as the latin ones .  
2	  I order this router along with a WET11 and WUSB . I have 2 computers and an Xbox and DSL . Thing is all of the computers and the Xbox are in different rooms . This was the best choice . I set it up and it worked great . The only problem I had was with the WUSB adapter and that was solved by a call to tech support . We spent some time on it and finally resolved the issue . ( He didn't speak english very well so I could barely understand him ) any way . If you are looking for a way to share your DSL line with an Xbox or extra computer this is a great affordable choice . And YES it does work with Xbox live .  
2	  I purchased this TV on May 21 . I felt like I got a smoking deal since I got free shipping and paid no sales tax but shipping took quite a bit longer than Amazon estimated due to the fact that once Eagle trucking received it , they made me wait an extra week for them to bring it to my house . Small problem considering the shipping was free . I was very impressed with the picture quality and features for the price . That is until the lamp unit failed last week after only two months of normal use . The TV suddenly began having problems turning on . The LED lights on the front indicated a lamp problem . I called Toshiba and they offered to mail me a replacement lamp unit without question ( lamp warranty is one year and they are user replaceable ) . They said it would take five business days but I actually got it today after only three business days . I installed the lamp and the TV now works perfectly again . My only hope is that this does not repeat itself in another two months . Depending on who you believe , these lamps are supposed to last anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 hours but a quick Internet search told me that Toshiba has had a continuing problem with their lamps failing prematurely . I recommend this TV if you can get a good deal on it but I wish I 'd purchased the extended warranty .  
1	  The product cannot be setup following the steps shown in the setup CD . I do find it very frustrating as i am not located in US and even calling up the toll-free technical support is not an option for me . Still struggling to get the router setup !  
1	  Chalk me up as another who wished he had read the reviews before this purchase . It works when it is being charged , and won't work otherwise . Also , for the price and look of it , the images are not impressive-not very clear compared with less expensive models . Here it is 2 days before Christmas and I bought 2 of these and now have to find replacements . ( In case you were wondering , yes , I had the same problem with both ) .  
1	  I must have gotten a defective mouse as it did not work for me . Had to return to Amazon-who is always good about returns . The frustration-free packaging was good tho-no stupid plastic shell to try to open . I ended up buying a Logitech V300 at my local Office Depot and it worked first time the dongle was plugged in .  
1	  This thing is horrible , and I am returning mine tomorrow . Picture quality is absolutely pathetic . I 've seen better pictures from camera-phones . In bright light , with no motion , with everyone holding their breath , you may be able to get an acceptably sharp picture . At any other time forget it . With decreasing light and increasing amounts of motion , picture quality degrades to a featureless blur of colors . I checked , double-checked , and re-checked to make sure that I wasn't missing something obvious ( I wasn't ) . In addition to this overarching complaint , I have to say that the camera body is flimsy , and feels cheap . Unlike the solid metal you find on , say , a Canon Powershot , this one is plastic . The cover for the battery station is made of the same cheap plastic , and feels as if it could break off after a moderate amount of use . This is exacerbated by the fact that it takes 4 AA batteries which must be removed for replacement or recharging . Battery life with standard Alkaline batteries was abysmal - after 20 shots the " check battery " indicator was already flashing . I never got around to checking the bundled software . After 1 bungled gymnastics meet it was clear that this was not the camera for me . The preview LCD is very large , sharp , and clear . In fact , pictures look better on it than they do at full size . Printed documentation is minimal . To learn about all of the settings , you must consult the soft-copy " Advanced " guide on the included CD .  
2	  I 'm not going to mark the product way down for not working because I still haven't figured out whether its something in my computers software or if its the Hardware of the card itself . When I first installed the wireless card it was working perfectly , getting full speed and great range , playing PC games over the internet was not a problem , nor was downloading torrents or just daily web browsing . However I moved my computer closer to the router and plugged it in directly and from that point on , my wireless card has not worked . Even when I unplug the hard line the card doesn't show up in Windows , I should mention that the card does still light up , even when windows doesn't recognize it . As I said before , I won't penalize this because I 'm not sure whos to blame , it could have very well been some sort of Windows Update that caused the issue just as much as a hardware failure . I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-Bit on a brand new custom built computer . I can't stress this enough that when this card was working for me , it was brilliant . Extremely fast and very easy to install , and the range was amazing . EDIT : After re-installing windows ( and trying it in another computer ) the card works perfectly again .  
1	  I was OK with Studio 8 for the first few months I had it , I made simple VCDs and DVDs of my friends , it was amusing . Then I tried to make some more complicated things , with multi-level menus , and a number of different file types , and fill up the whole DVD . I ended up with about 5 coasters . The pinnacle tech support was no help at all . Then I found TMPG DVD Author , used to make DVD files which are then burned from within the program or burned with Nero . TMPG has not produced any coasters yet . Now I do all my editing / transitions with Studio 8 , render it , and use TMPG to actually make the DVD . So all in all , I had to spend an extra $ 90 for a REAL dvd authoring progam to go along with Studio 8 .  
1	  I 'm drawing more attention to the prior comments on the brackets . I 've been using the camera in a Phoenix summer and it 's picture for the price is better than the other sub $ 100 night visions I 've tested but the bracket is not only ineptly designed it 's dangerous to your investment . The camera 's come off twice once from the clamp on the ball slipping and the camera " headbutted " the door beneath it .. cracked lens . It 's fatally flawed without making you own bracket hence the 2 stars , would be 4 other wise .  
2	  I have no experience with external hardrive enclosures . This was a quick and easy install . Just popped in my old hardrive and attached it to the computer . You can't mess up ! I loved it because it looks nice , it has a green and blue LED in the front telling you what 's going on , and it has a on / off switch . The encasement does not get that warm , despite hours of use . I would really recommend this product , especially for a first time user .  
2	  It works , it 's fast . It was delivered on time . What else can I say ?  
1	  LOL .. there has to be a mistake with the pricing here ! These heatsinks sell for ~ $ 25.00 new .. I knew the price of copper was on the rise but ..  
1	  I bought this headset and it was fine for the first few weeks and then the left speaker just went turned off . My audio controls said it still played yet nothing came out of it . I would suggest buying a different headset , don't waste your money with this one .  
2	  I assumed the radio would have a cord attached so I could plug it in . It didn't . I 'll have to hunt around for an adaptor . Other than that , it 's a good little radio .  
1	  How can you rate a service contract that you just purchased for an Asus MyPal A626 Handheld PC / PDA ? I got the Service Contract in case something happened to the Asus I ordered from Amazon on April 10 , 2009 , and still DO NOT have !  
2	  HP Pavilion a810n ( ready to ship version of the a850e series ) Factory Specs : Processor : AMD Athlon 64 3300 + processor ( 2.40GHz ) OS : Windows XP Home SP2Memory : 512MB DDR PC3200Graphics card : Integrated SiS Mirage2 Graphics with 128MB shared video memoryHard drive : 160GB Ultra DMA [ gigabyte is defined as 1,000,000,000 bytes , accessible capacity may vary ] Primary CD / DVD drive : Double Layer DVDR / RW drive with CD writer capabilitiesSecondary CD / DVD drive : CD-ROMMemory slots : 2 DIMM ( one available ) Front-access ports : 9-in-1 memory card reader ; 3 USB 2.0 ports ; 1 FireWire ( IEE 1394 ) port ; microphone / headphone / line-inCommunications : Integrated 10/100Base-T network interface ; 56K fax / modemSound : Integrated audioA couple of things about the factory specs : - With the factory setting ( 128MB shared video memory ) and no additional RAM installed you are actually working with 384MB of RAM right out of the box . You can however enter the BIOS and change the video memory to 64MB or 32MB to free up some RAM . - The 160GB hard drive is actually partitioned , one drive ( C ) is actually 142GB and obviously is the main partition where all your files will be managed , and the other drive ( D ) 6.06GB and is locked and contains all the factory reformat files , this way HP ( as many other companies do ) can save money and not actually send you a factory recovery disk . Now how 142 + 6.06 = 160GB is obviously PC maker new math and is why they add accessible capacity may vary to the system specs . I used it as it came out of the box for a while ( 1 + week ) and my initial impression was that even with using it at the factory configuration of 384MB of RAM it was much faster than my old Athlon 1300 + with 768MB of RAM ( which granted isn't very hard ) . The first thing that you notice about it is how incredibly quiet it is , you turn it on and if there weren't lights on the front you would honestly think that it wasn't running , and it 's not that it doesn't have fans , it does indeed have two , one on the CPU cooler and one on the rear of the case ( inside ) . I ran very intensive program combinations ( i.e. Adobe Photoshop + Trillian 3 Pro ( which oddly enough is a memory hog ) + Excel , Word , Outlook 2003 ) with no sign of stutter what so ever . I even traded up the old Microsoft keyboard I was using in favor of the new quiet key keyboard that came with the PC . Pros : - Quiet ( Very quiet ) - 64 bit processor - Double layer DVD burner ( does not include the LightScribe HP DVD burner ) - Price ( sub $ 700 system after rebates ) - Interesting bunch of included software including a DVD authoring / editing program , MSN Money 2005 ( OEM ) , Quicken - 7 total USB 2 ports ( 4 back , 3 front ) - 2 FireWire ports ( 1 front , 1 back ) - 9 in 1 memory card reader is very convenient - Sound is very decent ( but that could be attributed to my Bose MediaMate Speakers ) - Integrated video card performs better than expected playing newer games , with no stutterCons : - 128MB of shared video memory , I don't understand why PC makers don't just place a chip of memory the size of the " shared " video memory into one of the DIMM slots .. it isn't going to break the bank . - Integrated video - Integrated audio - Slathering of HP specific drivers / programs preinstalled - Mail-in rebate .. if you are planning on giving money back just do it - when will companies realize that if they just take money off at the time of purchase they will indeed be saving money by not having to hire an outside firm to handle the rebates - Secondary drive is a CD-ROM only ; in my opinion another DVD ( plain with no writing ability ) is more user friendlyMy upgrades and would suggest to anyone : Add another 512MB PC3200 DDR Ram to make a total of 1GB and replace the onboard graphic with a card like a 128MB Video Card GeForce FX 5200 .  
2	  It 's small , it 's affordable , and it keeps your camera stable . What 's not to like ? I 've used this miniature tripod for several months now and it 's great for use with macro photography and placing my camera into out-of-the way places for time-lapse shots . It 's a little bit of a chore to mount and remove the camera as the tripod doesn't use a detachable shoe , but overall the bang for the buck was just right .  
2	  I was programming an Ipod for a friend and became interested in buying one for myself . I went to the store to get some info on the Ipod , and luckily the departments store I frequent didn't carry the unit , but offered the Zune . I came straight home , did my reasearch , and ordered on the same day . The Zune is far more superior than any Ipod model that I have either read about or experienced for myself . And a much better deal moneywise . I must say that you shouldn't get a Zune unless you are running a Windows version with SP2 or higher , for any other ver . won't recognize the unit . I had a pc w / SP1 and Media Center 2002 , so I thought I was in trouble . Against my initial thoughts on SP2 , I went ahead and upgraded , and haven't had any problems yet . The sound is great , videos are decent , and the software is very user friendly . I would check out the other models of media players , especially the Archos brand , for they have a bigger screen and hard drive . But for audio and a few videos , this unit is worth the money .  
1	  I ordered with high hopes given the positive reviews at Amazon but when I set it up I found the door would not open . So I am sending it back dissapointed .  
1	  A Backup drive should be as dependable as the computer it 's backing up . But LaCie has other thoughts . Put some cheap hardware together and sell it . I have been using computers since the Radio Shack Model 1 days . And in that time I have never ever had a hard drive fail . Even so I thought a back up would be a good idea . My system using the LaCie would back up once a week at 6am . After three months the drive fails , turns into a door stop . Now I know I can send it back for warranty repair but all they are going to do is put the same undependable hardware back into it . So , whats the point . Look for another product and read the reviews which I didn't do .  
2	  After using Macs in college and for some of my professional life , I 've been a slave to the PC for the past 6 years . After getting fed-up with my Win98SE locking-up every day , I leapt for the iMac , in part because of the promise of the iPod . What a difference a day makes . I can now surf the net , listen to music and transfer tunes to my iPod without incident . With my PC , I was lucky to have multiple windows open while surfing . Try to open MusicMatch and I 'd lock-up . MusicMatch also had the annoying problem of inserting a clicking noise in the background of CDs that I burned . With iPod , I am free of my CDs completely . I have over 200 CDs on my new iMac and can transfer them to my iPod in seconds . The critics of the iPod are those running on Windows . Go figure .  
2	  A couple of these 1/2 GB memory cards worked perfectly to bring new life to an old Sony VAIO desktop that would slow to a crawl while running only basic software applications ( like web browsing ) . It seems that 1/2 GB is no longer enough memory even for Windows XP . Even after stripping out extra programs , the memory usage was on the brink . Bumping the memory up to 1 GB provided enough margin ( so far ) . Needed to replace the 2 - 1/4 GB memory cards with 2 - 1/2 GB cards since the old cards used up both of the memory slots .  
2	  Very cheap for the price , although it seems quite old since theres a big enter key  
1	  I bought this and set it up near a window in my upstairs condo unit . I live in a city with a local television station nearby and should be able to pick up a few channels . I was not able to pick up anything at all . When I tried assembling the loop , you have to squeeze the metal ends and fit them into the slots , it seems like the slots are too small . I was looking for a hammer to force them in .. Hammers and electronics are probably not the best combo , so I did my best with my fingers . The loop falls out and I have to put it back in again . I finally pushed on the metal ends with all of my might and they went in . It was surprisingly difficult to do ! It still didn't get a signal . Went shopping for an amplified antenna ..  
2	  I bought this item ( keyboard only , with an engraved Czech overlay ( it was cheaper that way , haha ) ) from a refurbishing company in the UK off eBay and I have to say it 's a fantastic device . It 's better than my old Logitech MX5000 keyboard , especially due to the backlighting ( which is bright ! ) and the built in mouse ( You need to find the right sensitivity in intellitype for it though , but that 's quick to fix ) . Also , using the internal Bluetooth card on my dell ( Wireless 360 Bluetooth Module ) , and the one on my ps3 , I haven't had any connectivity problems whatsoever . Also , contrary to some of the other reviews , this keyboard also works on standard 1.5V alkaline batteries ; just obviously don't hook it up to the charging hub when you 're using alkalines ( or they , as in the batteries , will rupture ) . By the way , I like it so much that I just bought the charging hub ( which can work in any country without a transformer , it only needs a plug adaptor to work in foreign countries ) from the same seller , along with some 2650 mAH NiMH rechargeable duracells ( The green Japanese made ones without the copper top ) . I 'm also looking around for a good deal on a standalone wireless laser mouse 8000 to complete my set . I 'll update this review with more info when I get these items . Just one more thing , for those people complaining that this keyboard doesn't work in the BIOS-of course it doesn't as it 's not connected through a USB interface ; it 's bluetooth , lol . ( Bluetooth HID devices usually aren't supported in computer BIOSes ) . Also , seriously , if you want this item nowadays , buy it off eBay as I don't think it 's in production now . I saw the whole combo going for $ 250 USD from an Israeli seller in Rishon Lezion , compared to the $ 369 here , and you can probably buy it by component at a price even cheaper than that ( although that will take some effort in eBay auctions , and the charging hub appears to be difficult to come by outside the UK at the moment off eBay ) . My only gripes are that the keyboard has very small arrow keys , and the fact that there is an utter lack of documentation online . Contrary to what other users say however , I could honestly care less about the lack of a number pad , I never use one and the fact there is no number pad makes the keyboard small and easy to move around .  
2	  This backpack has served all the purposes I 've hoped for . It 's large enough to carry all of my law books as well as my 15.4-inch computer . I 'm a little worried about it 's lack of waterproofing because of the rain , but otherwise , a great backpack .  
2	  I own this TV ; and I love it ! I have found no better quality TV in its price range or within a thousand dollars of its price range . I almost bought the Sharp Aquos until I compared the specs . The Olevia 's specifications surpass those of the Sharp Aquos and for a lot less money . You will not find the 1200:1 contrast ratio of the Olevia in the Sharp Aquos . I plan to buy another Olevia for my bedroom . I had never heard of this brand of TV before , but I 'm so glad I checked it out . The quality is superb and the beauty of the TV is unbelievable . This TV is quality inside and out . Everyone who comes to my home compliments this TV . It is the best looking TV on the market . I was tired of those silver LCDs . The classic black frame is beautiful-very tasteful . I loove my Syntax Olevia 32 ' LCD TV ; and if you owned one , you would love yours too !  
1	  I bought this product from KB Electronics . Because of this product , my digital camera stopped working . On giving a bad review to this product , KB Electronics offered me 10 % discount on my next product . So , I told them that I would give a good review to them if they can repair my camera . At this they went silent . So , basically this means that they would try to make someone silent with a few dollars , but if they have to fix their problems , then they would forget all morals and turn dumb . I don't know about the current company , but beware of the same thing happening to you guys . It is possible that KB Electronics has started selling the same product by the name of its sister concern - businesses do this all the time !  
2	  The Nikon SU-800 commander is such a great way for me to create lightfrom wherever I want . I do not like flash especially from the camera . This is a very portable way of doing amazing photo 's anywhere , even atnight in the dark and form any angle with a few small flashes on standsor just hand held . Opens up a new world of photo opportunities . Highly recommended . ray kennedy  
2	  I never heard of V-Moda before until my friend recommended it and wow I was surprised when i tried it . Amazing good bass and sound . It is perfect for bass-lovers like myself . Just remember to change the fittings so you can enjoy the best experience possible !  
1	  PROS : 1 . Solid build quality2 . Play video & MP3 ( though I haven't used these features since I bought it mainly for the GPS functionality ) 3 . Good price ( when it 's on sale and when they fix all the bugs below ) 4 . Uses NAVTEQ map dataCONS : 1 . Too thick and too heavy due to the 20gb hard drive inside2 . Too slow , everytime you try to move the map it reads the hard drive and then updates the screen , this process takes like 1-2 seconds and in computer terms it 's a life time3 . You can hear the hard drive spin up & down , kinda ennoying4 . The POI feature sucks big time , you would need to enter a state and then a city first , what if you only know the name of the restaurant and don't know exactly what city it 's in ? 5 . There 's no AC adapter , you would need to go to RadioShack and get one if you want to charge it at home and not in the car6 . It takes forever to LOCK on sat signal and this is even outdoors in the car driving , even when it locks on signal it would from time to time lose the signal , what good is a GPS navigator if there 's no signal ? 7 . It can get warm due to the hard drive8 . Update firmware requires a SD card not less than 128MB and not bigger than 512MB , nowadays people use 2GB cards so this is a big hassle9 . It doesn't display all the street names , only the one you 're driving on and if you 're lucky maybe a few other ones around your current positionIn short , this is such a waste of money but luckily I didn't buy it online and the store I bought it from has a 30-day money back return policy , I also bought the Mio C310x at the same time I bought this JVC and the Mio is such a wonderful GPS , it beats this piece-of-junk JVC in each and every category ( the mio doesn't play video unless you get the C710 ) and I paid 70 bucks less than what I paid for the JVC  
2	  I am a novice photographer but this camera is far and away the best camera I have ever owned .  
2	  Good product , but has some drawbacks . Viewing screen can be difficult to see in bright sunlight . Picture quality is good , however it would be nice to see a larger piture when viewing movies on the computer . Otherwise it is a very nice product and is easy to carry around and use . I have encountered no problems in operating it . Sound quality is also good .  
1	  Bought two of these HDMI cables along with a new Samsung TV and Blu-Ray player . While watching Blu-Rays & DVDs all of sudden the picture and sound on the TV went blank and would stay that way for several minutes or until I turned the TV / player on & off . I finally decided to swap HDMI cables with good ones I had and knew worked well and the problem has completely gone away . Glad I didn't return the Blu-Ray player . Beware , quality is spotty .  
2	  Very happy with the service and the product . Delivered a day before estimated . Was set up and running . The delivery people cleaned up after themselves and were very courteous . Have had the TV approximately 1 month . No problems , works well with everything we have . Love it ! The price dropped $ 303.00 . I called Amazon and they promptly refunded $ 303.00 . Thank you Amazon  
2	  I got this cooling pad during college after Best Buy confirmed that my HP laptop 's hard drive had literally melted . This pad made my computer go from that to cool to the touch-with the PC 's high-powered fan speed never being triggered . It 's quiet-can't hear the low setting over my computer , and the high setting is quiet too . I like that it has 2 fans , and that it blows away on two sides-so if one side is blocked , it 's not a big deal . It is pretty bulky-an inch thick-to bring to school in my backpack along with books and laptop . I 'm currently , after having this 7 years , looking for a portable one , but this one 's left me with high expectations ! Update : The cord began to split away from the USB connection , rendering the pad powerless . I was reluctant to purchase this pad again , since it costs more than other pads that are now on the market . However , one big plus for my laptop that only has 2 USB ports is Antec 's is the USB cord provided another USB port . I shelled out the money a new one , same kind , and the cord didn't have this feature ! A few months later , my current cord began to stop working where it connects to the pad . I have to maneuver it into just the right position for it to work . Needless to say , I won't be buying this bulky , faulty cord product again !  
2	  I am very pleased with these speakers . The sound is crisp and clear , and they can handle a good enough load to deliver full sound to the medium-sized room where I put them . They are also nice looking . I definitely think they are a value for the money .  
1	  I have a WAP11 access point and WPC11 PC card . In a word , no range , no throughput and no customer service . Forget about 150 meters indoors , it drops off at about 10 meters , and that is line of sight ! At that point the signal strength goes down to about 30 % where it is unreliable . Even when the PC is 5 feet from the access point , throughput is at about 1MBPS instead of 11 ( even though the monitor claims its 11 ) . Moving away doesn't reduce the speed . It stays at 11 all the way until it just disconnects . I had hanging problems , but frankly , the product is so useless I haven't even used it enough to really give it a workout . Since it barely works outside of the room that contains the access point , I might as well just wire it up . Customer service ? I 've sent 2 emails that went unanswered . I 've called in and waited for an hour only to have someone take my name for a call back . They did call back ! Only it was 5 days later and I wasn't home . I waited on hold only to have someone pick up who sounded on his death bed . I only got 3 sentences out when he hung up on me . I could go on . I only got through to someone moderately helpful twice . Both suggested I buy an antennae , saying that it would of course void the warrantee . I am kicking myself for just assuming that the product really worked and letting my 30 day return period expire .  
1	  I purchased this through Amazon . The first one was late and determined lost in shipping . Amazon immediately sent another one overnight one day delivery . It worked great accept for the rechargeable battery transceiver and plug . The plug didn't seem to fit completely into the transceiver , so Amazon shipped it back at no cost sent another unit out 2 day post . That unit has the exact same issue . It will not charge rechargeable batteries which is its sole purpose . I even went out and bought eight new Radioshack rechargeable AA , cost $ 38 , to make sure it wasn't the batteries . It wasn't . This unit gets NOA crystal clear in my truck as well , but no CB channels get any reception . Instead of shipping this one back to Amazon for a fourth unit or just returning it and moving on to another CB maker , I called Midland Radio and they are sending me a new rechargeable transceiver and plug . If that doesn't work it goes back and I will buy elsewhere .  
1	  The insulating jacket did not allow the cable to seat properly . I had to keep pressure for the pins to make contact .  
1	  I bought this system looking for a quick way to extend my cable box . What a mistake ! Although the distance was only about 25 feet ( on the same floor ) this system could not send or receive a signal at all . The IR worked OK ( changing channels and turning the cable box off and on ) but there was no audio or video reception . Even when I pointed the antennas directly at each other ! I tried all the various channels to no avail . Oh and they say all cables included ; . your tv had better be within 2 feet of the extender . The coax jumper and a / v cables are about 36 " long . I am very disappointed in this system . Browsing the website , I see I must have received old stock . The units I received look nothing like what amazon has posted now .  
2	  I purchased this 5 disk changer when my old one went out . This one by far exceeds expectations . It will save your place on each disk . You can go back to any of them at any time . I would highly recommend this to serious movie watchers .  
2	  this is a great camera that i have at my home in CA already . I use it to tape myself skating at Woodward . Great Camera !

2	  I had a pair of these previously , and loved the comfort and sound quality . The only problem was that after a year and a half of ungentle use , the rubber housing on the wires was shredded pretty badly . The sound hadn't deteriorated at all , however . I ordered a replacement pair ( for the price and quality , I figured it was worth it ) . To my delight , the second pair are every bit as great as the originals , but Sony 's changed the sleeves for the wires to one that is a little less flexible , but seems to be far more durable . If they do wear out again , I 'll most likely be replacing them with the same kind . I had to get used to the style of cord-I wear it under my shirt going down my back so my mp3 player rests in my right pocket . I find I can do just about any activity this way , and the cord doesn't get in my way .  
1	  My Toshiba 42 " 1080 lasted 7 months prior to losing its picture . It was taken to the warenty repair station and part ordered and back ordered the same day taken in . Today is one month into the repair , no TV and still no part . No excuse for this kind of service on a $ 2000 product in this day and age . Parts can be gotton anywhere in the world in three days or less , from my experience . The Repair station called today to get me to come pick the TV up to get it out of his way cause its cluttering his work area up . Totally Disgusted with this kind of service , and just want to warn folks against buying a Toshiba product , cause this is what your getting for repair support . Jamie  
1	  I purchased this neoprene slip case to use for my 17 " notebook because I couldn't find any better ones . Though it fits , it 's not the greatest notebook case I 've had . So if you can find a better one , slightly higher in price , it might be worth it over this particular one .  
2	  The battery life is decent . I can get about 200 shots out of the battery before I need to change it . Not nearly as long lasting as my Casio Exlim , but the camera is better .  
2	  when i recieved this item i was really impressed with the construction . it was not some cheap plastic pice of junk with crappy signal and even crappier transmistion . with the normal antenna i am able to keep in contact with my friends on the road for about 1/4 to 1/2 of a mile ( easy ) , with the added roof antenna we have been able to talk to each other at about a mile apart ( have not had a chance to test it further yet ) without any signal loss . the extra features of the CB are nice and it is heavy enough to know that it is made to last but not too heavy to put on your belt all day long . also the power adaptor makes it great to conserve battery life on long drives . if you have a car and have difficulty mounting a normal radio or just want a portable version , this is it !  
1	  I have had the A80 for only 3 weeks and already the battery door is broken . In taking about 100 pictures , I was very disappointed at how slow it is to focus . Sometimes it seemed like it was 5 seconds between when I pushed the button and when it finally took the picture . Often the opportunity was long gone by the time the image was acquired . Otherwise , the pictures are ok , and I like the software that came with it . So , I 'm off to FedEx to send it for repair .  
1	  So far I have purchased 2 of these poor excuses for finished software . Neither ever installed properly on my PC running XP home edition . The error I kept receiving was " computer not modified " . On my first copy , despite entering the proper license ID and Password , it would always give me an error code that said that I had not entered the correct license ID . Save yourself the trouble and frustration . This company should send all of its customers who purchased the previous terrible versions either full rebates or the latest version , assuming that PoddMax 09 actually works which I doubt . I really wanted all the features to work but alas , none ever did on my desktop or laptop . Support for any of these problems was totally non existent . It is as close to a sham as I have ever seen . Amazon should be ashamed of itself for carrying this piece of trash . Podmaxx 09  
1	  This is poor piece of equipment . I used it a few dozen times over about four months . In month five when I tried to watch it , it wouldn't even come on .  
2	  The device performs exactly as indicated in the literature . All of the features function correctly and with excellent sensivity . In addition , the amazon . com performaance was excellent . I chose the free shipping option . I ordered Tuesday evening . The unit was shipped within 24 hours from a Kentucky warehouse . It was in the UPS Minneapolis office Saturday and was delivered Monday .. six days after my order ! Bravo Beltronics and bravo amazon . com !  
2	  I bought the Harmony 1000 , and can say it is well worth the $ 300-400 price tag for those with high end home entertainment systems . It programmed quite easily compared to say the Phillips Pronto I also own , which cost more and required about 20 hours of crunching on the PC software and " learn " functions to get right ( now I 'm afraid to change the components ! ) I programmed a DVD , AV receiver , TV , and DirecTV DVR , very easily on the Harmony , in 20 minutes , and on a Mac - the software is Java based on the internet , so no platform worries . I did have some problem with programming the Apple TV , but a call to customer support cleared this up easily . Again the internet based software meant they could access my Harmony settings through the net , write a new configuration for the Apple TV , have me test it , and then delete the old / non-functional configuration . Neat .  
1	  Well I had been a fan of Netgear up until this router . This is my third netgear router and the other two ( both 802.11b ) had performed flawlessly . I have owned this router for about 8 months and it just recently started dropping connections . I have seen other reviewers mention reliability issues as well . At first I blamed wireless interference from my neighbors but after connecting direclty to the router via ethernet cable I could still not get a connection . I could not even access the router login and no response to pings . I cycled power but no luck . Then I happened to pick up the router and noticed that I could pretty much cook lunch on the thing it was so hot . After disconnecting power and letting it cool down it works fine until it heats back up again and drops the connection . Not exactly what I am looking for in a router . Now if I was looking for a combo router / hotplate this would fit the bill but I 'm not . So this bad boy is headed for the trash and I 'll be trying another brand . Any suggestions ?  
1	  Inspect screen Before signing and accepting delivery of any Toshiba DLP , be sure to check the screen to make sure that the coating on the inside of the screen is uniform . On mine , there was a circle about 10 " in diameter that you can see in certain lighting and even when the TV is off ! It will appear lighter than the surrounding areas at times and can be annoying . I called Toshiba and had a service man come out and even though he acknowledged that this is common , Toshiba will not replace the screen . I would have given them a negative 10 if it were possible just because of their attitude . So , look at the screen VERY carefully before accepting or purchasing . If you see this problem , refuse to accept it . Or else just buy a Samsung or Mitsubishi DLP to avoid the problem I have . carefully before accepting delivery  
2	  I 've been using a Dymo LabelWriter Twin Turbo for about three years . I accidentally plugged in the wrong type of AC adapter into my USB hub and " poof " my printer blew out . So I ordered a new one . I can tell you that for a small home office environment and postage printing , this printer will do the trick . The latest software synchronizes with your Outlook Contacts so it is " easy breezy " to create address labels for those who are in your Outlook address book . I just received my replacement and there 's a problem with the installation , at least for Windows 7 . The disk that comes with the printer installs the software ( addressing & stamps ) but does NOT install the driver . If you buy this printer and are running Windows 7 here 's what you need to do : Go to Dymo 's Website ( [ .. ] ) and click on " support - drivers & downloads " . From here you can download the latest software AND drivers and you 'll be good to go . If this is a first time installation , don't plug in the USB printer cable until prompted to do so by the software download . So , aside from the installation problem , this is a printer you can count on for the long haul ; provided you don't do something stupid like I did and blow it out with an incorrect AC adapter . :-( LOL !  
2	  This product was simple to set up and works great ! I have the transmitter connected to a DirecTV receiver and the remote control " mouse " sitting in front of the DirecTV infrared sensor . The RF-Link receiver is in the next room and the picture is great and the remote control works . I 'm glad I didn't get a cheaper 2.4 GHz model because we also have wireless phones , wireless internet and a microwave in close proximity and there is no interference whatsoever . This product could not have been any simpler to set up and I 'm absolutely satisfied .  
1	  So I have a SYX by SysteMAX , which is a pretty standard mid-tower case . These things do not fit , but I really liked the idea , so a couple of zip ties did the job . Took about an hour to figure out that the bracket it came with was completely useless , and you have to kind of squeeze it into place . There is a noise difference as well , GPU temps did not drop at all but I 'm seeing about 5 degrees F lower on my CPU . All in all , would I buy these again ? Not unless it was a seamless install .. Pretty dissatisfied but w / e more air flow through my machine .  
2	  We tried this system out today to downtown Boston and noted three problems : ( 1 ) the system loses satellite reception whenever the car is under a tunnel , which happens quite often when you drive in downtown Boston . Once you emerge out of a tunnel ( and really need directions ) , the system takes a while to figure out where the car is , by which point you 've already missed several turns ; ( 2 ) When we were driving along I-90 , the system kept asking us to exit to streets that were above the highway . Somehow the depth information was lost and the system was fooled into thinking that the two roads intersect ; ( 3 ) the voice announcement about a turn comes too late , almost at the time of a turn . When you hear the announcement , the car has already missed the turn . With all these one-way streets , that means we have to drive around and around before getting back to where we were . Other than these problems we 're pretty happy with the system . We particularly like to hear it " recalculating " whenever we disobey its commanded route .  
1	  Works , but have realy bad definition , low picture resolution , don't work at night , you can't see nothing , bad product . PYLE PLCM7200 7-Inch TFT Mirror Monitor / Back-Up Night Vision Camera Kit  
2	  Its a simple piece but when you 're missing it .. no radio . Went in within 2 minutes and worked just like it should . Thanks !  
2	  Monster iFreePlay Cordless Headphones for iPod shuffle is really cool , no hand , no cables , just put in your ears and enjoy  
2	  Cable allows video to be transferred from tape to computer . Works like a charm !  
1	  I purchased this camera as a travel camera to take on an upcoming trip . My other camera is a Nikon D80 . I read lots of reviews for the Canon point & shoot cameras and decided to give this one a try because of the image stabilization . This is my first Canon camera since my old 35mm Canon Snappy . I 've taken it out on a couple of shoots before our trip . Pros :* Very small and light , easy to carry around . * Takes regular AA batteries which is great if your rechargable batteries run out of juice during a trip . I do recommend buying high quality rechargables though . * Produces very vivid colors which equal great photos . * Has image stabilizer which is a very nice feature in a camera under $ 150 ! Cons :* The time it takes to get ready between shots with the flash is waay too long . By the time it is ready again , the moment has passed or the subjects have moved on or changed their expressions because of the long wait .. " oh hang on .. just a minute .. stay right there .. " That doesn't work . * Very close to impossible to see the screen in sunlight ( even with a glare reducer / protective film ) . No problem one might say , there is a viewfinder .. see next con .. * The viewfinder is not true to what you actually take a picture of .. useless if you are zooming for sure ! * No battery life indicator that I have found . I wouldn't buy this particular camera if I had it to do over again for my needs . I also had a problem with it right out of the box ( an apparent spec of dust is inside the lens which requires shipping it to Canon to be fixed .. not a very good start for me with my Canon experience ) . The customer service guy at Canon was very nice however . It should take about 10 days to 2 weeks to get the camera back . It was purchased to take on a trip this weekend so all of the pictures will have a dust spec shadow in them . To me , the importance of the cons outweighs the importance of the pros . Most cameras today do take great pictures . The viewfinder is basically useless and the screen is too hard to see outdoors . No matter how vivid and nice the pictures are capable of being , if you can't frame your picture and even make sure the subject is in the picture because you can't see the viewfinder in the light .. what 's the point ? If you are going to use this mostly in overcast or indoor shots , it would be great and that is where the image stablization comes in handy but then you have to wait for the flash . If you have to use the flash much , patience is required because you can't take more than one fast . If I did it all over again , I wouldn't get this camera simply because it doesn't fit with my needs . I 'm sure others are very happy with it and that 's great . Hopefully after I get back from our trip and have it repaired , I 'll learn to like it too . I 'm a huge online shopper but I would buy locally next time so that if there was a problem ( like I have with the lens issue ) , I could return it directly to the store for an exchange . I won't purchase another camera from an online store but I will give Canon another try one day .  
1	  Okay so these were like a really big deal during Christmas and i still have yet to figure out why . We keep up with all of the new electronics and this is probobly the worst buy weve made . The flash goes off when it feels like it and the button to take the pictue RARELY ever works ! Its really that bad .  
1	  I have to returned this router which keeps dropping internet connection . This router is also highly troublesome to roboot and it is sensitive to the sequence of insert wires . Working with it is a pain . I bought a netgear router from walmart which works flawlessly .  
2	  I received the product quickly , packed well . The quality of the charger is OK , but not really HIGH quality , but I knew that before I ordered it . It charged up the battery I installed in it . I have only charged the battery once , but I feel safe in assuming it will perform properly for an acceptable lifetime . The price was very good ; however , I do not care for the practice of displaying a super-low price , and charging an extra-high price for the shipping . Even though the total cost was acceptable , I regard it as a slippery , deceptive practice .  
2	  UPDATE 12/17/06 : HOW TO MAKE THE SUBTITLES WORK ! If you highlight the subtitle file and press " Angle " button and it doesnt give you the ' divX subtitle selected ' message , then do these steps ! 1 . Press the " Menu / PBC " button . ( then .. wait till it displays " PLAY " ) 2 . Press the " Stop " button . ( this will stop whatever it played , duh ! ) 3 . Press the " Menu / PBC " button again . ( it should go back to the file explorer mode ) 4 . Highlight the subtitle file and press " Angle " like normal . 5 . Highlight your movie file and press " Play " . THATS IT ! don't ask me why and how it works , it just does ! After 2 + years of usage , It is still working . DVD playback is bad on scratched DVD 's ( I 'm talking dvd-rental scratches , which my computer DVD plays fine ) seems more like a buffer problem or the lens . Other than that , it plays clean CD / DVD 's flawlessly . Works out for me because I mostly watch freshly burned divX movies . - Old reviewAll the pros have been covered in the other reviews as well as the cons . I 'll touch on some of the cons . - Accessing the menu is not that hard to get used to . - The player being only able to display 12 chars ( ? ) of the file names really can be a bother . This player IS ABLE to display DIVX Subtitles : - go to menu - find your subtitle file - press the Angle button ( it will display ' DivX subtitle selected ' ) - now find your divX movie file and play it normallyThe subtitle could be a lot better tho . Can't change the color of the text ( yellow , no background ) , it 's pretty bad on the eyes . Also , some letters are not displayed properly .  
1	  Bought this to replace a 300 watt power supply on an older computer . Very easy to install and had plenty of power cords . It ran great and was very quiet for around 45 days then it just quit . Don't know if I got a bad one or if the quality on this product is lacking . I ordered a new one and spent a little more money hoping to get one that will last .  
2	  Having lost or broken several pairs of expensive compact binoculars in the past , I was determined that this time I was going to get a product that wouldn't break my heart or my wallet when it was gone . When I opened the package I was impressed with the hefty feel and rubberized coating of the Powerview . The optics are crystal clear and light gathering capability seemes to be excellent . These binocs should be fine for everything from birding to ballgames to spying on the neighbors ! As for the price , as clumsy and forgetful as I am I should have bought two !  
1	  I 've been using one of these for the past year or so , and really need to warn people away from them . It 's nice and cheap , and it looks great and has a great user interface through its web UI - but it has a serious bug . Heavy internet use will cause it to crash - it won't even respond to pings from the LAN . To fix this requires a manual power cycle . This really bit me badly last weekend , when I was on the road and needed to log into my home machine via ssh - the MR814 had crashed and the internet connection was down as a result . It 's a real shame , as in most other respects , it 's a perfectly good product . But the reliability problems are just too serious .  
2	  This is really good . I bought it last weekend ( today is thursday ) and it has worked really really well . It plays the music i put on it better then ive ever heard it before , even better then my cd player . It has really good controls and buttons , which i think are much easier then those of my brothers 15 GB ipod . The battery life is fine , i dont know why people keep saying its not enough . Eight hours is alot . Think about it , how many days a week are you going to spend exactly eight hours listening to your ipod , espeially if you have school . Also , the storage space is actually alot as well if u think about it . 1,000 songs is alot of music to hold at one time . Most people who have the 15 GB or higher hardly fill up more then 1,000 songs anyway . Besides if you get tired of the music that you have on it , then take it off by simply hooking it up to itunes and deleting it off and then you can fill it up again with new music . I also like the material its made of more then the normal ipods , because the mini is made of a metal that doesn't scratch unless you purposely get something sharp and scratch it . The only problem that i had with it ( I dont have it anymore ) is that when i hooked it up to my PC , it was encredibly hard to get i to work . Ive had itunes for a month or so , so its not like im new to itunes . I plugged it in and it had all of these different formatting errors that took me roughly four hours to figure out and fix . So unless you 're a computer genious , then plan to spend a couple hours being really angry that it wont instantly download your music .  
1	  I bought this toy last Christmas for my then 9 year old daughter . She loved it but was frustrated that its recording time / photo capacity is so small and the quality of the picture is sub-par . It eats batteries like crazy and inexplicably just stopped working after a few months . Much too expensive for the actual quality , especially when you can buy a real digital hand cam now for a few hundred dollars . If this toy had cost around $ 30.00 I would have given it a great review .  
1	  The printer works great with my computer running XP SP1 , but is not compatable with a newer computer running XP or any of my laptops that are running Vista . The fact that this printer is NOT Vista compatible should be highlighted .  
2	  This item does what its supposed to and having the Canon name and quality backing it is a plus .  
2	  I recently upgraded my digital camera to the G1 ( from an older Casio VGA ) and I couldn't be happier . It is easy to use and takes excellent pictures for a " prosumer " ( I 've taken over 500 since it arrived ) . The user interface will be familiar to Canon film camera users and it seems to offer the right combination of automated and manual features . This camera comes equipped with everything you need : cables , storage , rechargeable , remote control , software , etc . The only complaint would be the size of the 16MB CompactFlash . You probably will want a 32MB or bigger device - but that purchase can wait because the computer interface on this is excellent and uploading is a pleasure . The USB interface and Type 1 and 2 card support are the way to go . This gives you a lot of future protection and upgrade options . The included software is more than adequate . ZoomBrowser the camera manager is the best picture organizer I have used . The TWAIN driver has worked with all my photo and video editors . The battery is incredible - long life and fast recharge - can't ask for more . The LCD display is really useful . There are better displays out there but none more convenient . The ability to tuck it away saves on battery and cleaning the display . The 360 degree orientation is great . I use it in conjunction with the remote control to great effect .  
1	  I 've been really trying to like this package , using it now for close to five months . In that time I 've logged well north of 8,000 road miles . I 'm running it on a T-Mobile MDA with a BT338 Bluetooth GPS . Installation originally was a royal PITA - the installer on the first CD did not work at all . I finally managed to work around this using their " patch " on their web page , and got both the application and maps ( along with a voice ) loaded on my SD card . Pairing the BT GPS was not obvious either in terms of setup , but once I had that figured out , it worked . The good : 1 . It routes nicely most of the time and the instructions work . It 'd be nice to have the program actually use voice generation if its available ( e.g. Microsoft Voice Command is loaded ) so that it speaks the actual names of streets and such , but I can live with " Turn left " - most of the time . Where does it screw you ? When you come to a complex intersection and there 's more than one " left ! " Now you have to look at the screen - not too cool when you 're driving . 2 . The " touch anywhere to get the manu " is good . 3 . MOST of the time , you can hit the END key on the phone and get the main top screen back , while leaving the application running . This is useful - when it works . Inexplicably , sometimes TT has " Taken over " and there 's no way out except to quit the application . I 've been unable to figure out WHAT makes it do that .. 4 . IF a call comes in , TT mutes and you can take it , but it remains running . I like this - a lot . It then unmutes when your call is over , and back you go . 5 . You can operate it without using the stylus , touching the screen , just like it should be . Excellent . Ok , so what 's not to like ? Unfortunately , the maps . The maps in this product are SEVERELY out of date . For instance , there 's a section of US-31 in South Alabama that I travel from time to time . TT insists that IT IS NOT THERE AT ALL . This is not a new road - it hasn't been changed in the 5 years I 've lived in this area . The application simply freaks out and tries to route you down all sorts of little streets in this area , which is not cool . If you were coming into this area without knowing this , you 'd get SEVERELY lost listening to the device - when the right thing to do is just keep driving .. Likewise , there are multiple pieces of roads in SC , north of Dothan AL and elsewhere that I also know haven't been added in the last couple of years , yet they too are simply " not there " or are WAY off . And these are not small secondary streets either - we 're talking MAJOR throughways . There are also significant errors in some parts of the US that haven't been updated in TWENTY YEARS . For instance , Northern Michigan near Traverse City . I attempted ( foolishly ) to run a route to a hotel there that 's been there since I was attending school up there in 1981 - TT insisted that the destination address was more than TWENTY MILES from where I knew it was . The bad news is that this corrupted its idea of " best route " into the general area ; good thing I knew better than to follow it or I would have been HOPELESSLY lost . Again - this is not a " new " address - its a hotel I stayed at in 1980 ! Good thing I knew where I was going .. Essentially anything built in the last 5 years is asking for TT to claim that the address itself does not exist and default to a " range " . That 's ok in urban areas and will usually get you reasonably close . In rural areas the " range " might be 5 - or more - miles away . A horse ranch in Seiverville TN that I tried to route to - established in the 1980s - was one of these ; TT had absolutely no clue where it was in terms of address and tried to take me down what was DEFINITELY the wrong road , but when driving there magically the streets were all on the map ! Huh ? As for the POC database , that 's at least as bad , if one looks at completeness . How about this ? Select SouthEast , then try to route a route to the POC called " Walt Disney World " under " Amusement Parks . " Do ' ya think TT ought to know how to get THERE ? Does it get any bigger than that ? Guess what - it doesn't have it in the list ! Nor does it have MGM Studios listed . But " Walt Disney Animal Kingdom " is , and so is Epcot . Tell me how that makes sense - please ? Local stuff is even worse - of the larger restaurants around here that I know have been here since at least 2001 ( when I moved here ) at least half are missing . How does TT decide what to include and what not ? Who knows . There appears to be NO way to get updates to the maps . At all . TomTom 's web site is completely silent about updates to software or map databases , and their " online " service offers city-by-city add-on maps , but are they more current ? No way to know - and I 'm not about to buy one at a time to find out either - never mind the expense . How about accurate maps in the first place ? Other complaints : The software doesn't know how to read contacts off the PDA / phone . This is such a simple thing that you 'd think they 'd have it in there - but its not . Dumb . There 's no good way to route ON a certain street . You can set ONE ( and only one ) " waypoint " , but you can't tell the software " Use Route 90 " . This sucks if you know what road you 'd like to be used for a specific part of your route , but want the software to handle the rest . Attempting to approximate this using the waypoint feature usually leads to really BIZARRE routings .. " Shortest " is a waste of time . It 'll be " shortest " all right - right down every residential street between where you are and where you want to go . " Fastest " is the only reasonable route option to use , unless you want one of the specialty ones ( bicycling ? ! Ok , I guess that makes sense ) Time to destination is stupidly off on many non-freeways . Basically , it appears that the software thinks of everything off-freeway as being 25mph or somesuch ! I 've had it claim that a 50 mile drive on surface highways , all of which is a 55 or 65mph zone with the exception of a few small " one light " towns where you have to slow down for a couple of miles , is a 2 + hour trip . Balderdash . It appears that the " speed class " on any road that has a slow zone in it is set - for the entire duration - as that slower speed . This is a major botch and makes time prediction for anything other than freeway driving rediculously wrong . Freeway speed zoning appears to be wrong too , but less badly - it sure isn't 70mph through all the 70mph states .. No automatic day / night palette switching . This one is so easy I 'm shocked , to be honest . Oh well ; a few clicks does it . The software is a total CPU pig , to the point that it blows up VoiceCommand if called while its running . This means you can't initiate a voice call while TT is operating on the PPC , as there aren't enough cycles left on the CPU . Granted , this may be just " reality " on the MDA , as its not a terribly powerful machine - but it still is a bummer . The software allows you to load as many " regional " maps as you 'd like . The stupidity of this , however , is that you can't route inter-region . Dumber ! So you have to switch to " Major Roads of America " , and then switch to your destination region and recompute when you enter it . That I can live with , but I won't tell you I like it - to be honest , I think it kinda sucks . 2GB MiniSD cards are available , and as such you can load the whole map store on ONE card - why not allow seamless navigation as an option ? Beware their copy protection system . Their " code " requires an online connection to register the software , and there are only TWO codes available - ever - which must be acquired six months apart from each other . God help you if your device breaks outside of that range - you 've got a box full of worthless CDs . A support request when I was attempting to get the software to load was ignored . I figured it out on my own - several days later - without a response . Don't expect help from the company , because you won't get it . I didn't attempt to use the " PLUS " services because , quite honestly , if you can't provide accurate maps - why would I buy add-on services that are likely no more accurate ? I bought this because TT is thought of as the " leader " in the marketplace . The user interface is nice , the product works , but the map inaccuracies , protection scheme and complete lack of customer support leave me recommending against it and giving it only ONE star . Nice try TomTom .  
2	  Works great and is small and easily portable . I don't use it for loud music , but for white noise in my daughter 's room , so I can't attest to it 's stereo quality .  
2	  I received these headphones as a birthday gift . I am a dedicated ( but slow ) runner , who likes to listen to podcasts or music while I run . I am on my second shuffle , but I 've gone through a couple dozen pair of headphones . I normally buy cheap headphones , and the wire wears out after 20-40 times running with them . So far , I 've run ten times with these cordless headphones . The volume control is a bit cumbersome with the way the shuffle is situated in the headphones , and I usually wear a headband to keep the headphones from jostling or slipping while I run . Other than those two minor complaints , I am competely satisfied with the product . I 'm hopeful that since the shuffle plugs directly into the headphones , I won't be constantly replacing headphones because of wear with the wiring . I really like them , I think they are a fantastic idea . I 'm hopeful they will last for at least a year or two . I think that $ 50.00 may be a little steep for what the product is , but I believe the price will gradually slide as other manufacturers make a similar product . One other downside .. I feel like Lobot , Lando Calrissian 's sidekick from The Empire Strikes Back when I wear these headphones . :-)  
2	  OMG , why did i wait so long , this is the most incredible and fun computer i have ever owned . you just plug it in and it works perfect , the screen is gorgeous , i dont see how i can ever go back to my PC . I love my 6 ipods and have been waiting to try a mac and finally took the plunge . My only regret is not doing it 3 years ago . If you are thinking about it , dont , you will love this machine . I would have gotten the 24 inch but they did not have it in stock . A totally amazing machine , that is also fun , and i dont have to worry about viruses . It even set up my home wireless system seamlessly and shared my itunes music from my pc just like that , i did not even have to click a button . most impressive  
2	  received these as a gift after i lost an old pair of cheapy binoculars that i used for birding . was a little wary at first since there were only 2 reviews , but i have to agree with the other reviewers that these are great for people that wear glasses . the plastic twist-up eye cups are much more sturdy and easier to use than the rubber roll-down ones i 've seen on other binoculars . image is crisp and clear , even over glasses . it also seems that the price is also very reasonable , as many birding resources recommend binoculars that cost over $ 100 , if not $ 300 .  
1	  I got this scanner and hooked it up to my PC with no problems . It scanned really good images from photos until .. I had noticed large specs on the photos in the same areas each time . I read the instructions on cleaning the glass and scanned again .. but they were still there . Upon further examination of the glass , there were large particles of dust underneath the glass with no way to get it out . I contacted Canon directly and they said it was " anti-glare treatment " applied under the glass . Whatever ! The Canon rep said I would be compensated under their warranty terms for a refurbished scanner of the same kind . I told them to take a flying leap ! Never again will I buy a Canon product !  
2	  Before I purchase this lens , I read all that I could find about it . It is as they say it is . Big and heavy but not heavy enough for you to use it without a tripod . The proper word for it is manageable , after a while you get use to it . I use this lens for nature photography and the pictures come out terrific ! I have read bad reviews about this product such as : you cannot put the lens cover on or removed it while you have the lens hood on - not true ; the lens is slow , again not true . The question is .. What are you really trying to shoot ? Are you trying to take a shot of a speeding bullet ? , then you 've got the wrong lens . The lens is perfect for everyday use , there is nothing wrong with it . thanks SIGMA for making the APO 50-500mm F4-6.3 EX DG Lens a reality .  
1	  This unit is priced way too high for what it is : A flimsy plastic toy . Mine arrived DOA and unfortunately I didn't have time to test it before the return period expired . I took it apart and found a loose connection on the receiver output wire . A simple solder job to repair it , but that should not have happened straight out of the box . Both of the microphones are crap - on par with the $ 5 Radio Shack units . The lav is very tinny and thin sounding . While the handheld sounds slightly better , the build quality is terrible and it feels like a child 's toy . If you are looking for professional equipment on a tight budget , look elsewhere !  
1	  These headphones are a great idea but they made me feel like I was going to vomit . Seriously ! If you are prone to motion sickness I don't think these are for you , unless you carry barf bags around with you .  
1	  Fist off , I 'll say that as a player , this thing was pretty slick when it was working . Good sound , I like the screen , everything about it was great . But now , I own a $ 300 paperweight .. The drive on this thing has been corrupted , and now my PC no longer recognizes the device . I have tried everything , and support can't help me either . But basically since I have owned it , I have had to deal with frequent " flake outs " where the player decides it can't figure out what it 's doing and shuts off . Twice , the tag database has been corrupted to the point where I have had to reformat the player , and on this third time around , the reformat fails , and I 'm pretty much stuck with a music player with no songs on it . It has been nothing but problems since the start . Again , decent player when it works , but I 've since gone online and checked other sites ' reviews of this thing and I 'm not the only one who has had MULTIPLE problems with the device . I wish I could give this thing a good review but to anyone going out and buying one , be prepared to be frustrated , and possibly left out in the cold with an unusable device .  
1	  Four months out of warranty , my power supply died . And yes , Dell tried to tell me it was tech support . Stay away from this model , at least . I 'll post an update if Dell decides to help me out .  
1	  Just to get this part out of the way , if you use the Seagate ST650211U-RK 5.0GB USB 2.0 Pocket Hard Drive within its advertised and UNadvertised limits , it works pretty well . That said , what the packaging , fact sheet , and specs do not tell you is that the drive is severely limited compared to other drives . Want to allocate three or more partitions ? Sorry , all you get is two and not the usual four ( three primaries and one extended ) . Want to use something other than FAT32 for your file system ? Sorry again . I bought the drive to carry conveniently two bootable systems , the freeDos included in the Seagate package and Knoppix , a self-configuring Debian Linux distro that boots on just about anything and identifies just about all hardware and networks on its way up . I 'm used to packaging that says that the supported operating systems are Windows and Mac - no Linux - but going unsupported into Linux-land is something I 've just had to get used to . With the machine in Win XP Pro , I plugged in the drive and loaded the Seagate CD . The drive showed up just fine , and the CD let me check out the documentation and install the Toolkit software . I 've got serious gripes about the Toolkit . First , there is no choice about where it loads its stuff ( forced into C :\ Program Files ) . Second , it puts its HTML doc there , too . Third , with no warning or any mention anywhere at all in the doc , it adds a silent startup of the toolkit to the registry at Run , and that brings up Four , there is * no * uninstall and not even an entry in Add / Remove Programs . This is an extremely arrogant installation script . As for repartitioning , I only tried the reasonable : a small FAT16 active boot partition with freeDos and grub , an ext3 Linux partition ( primary ) , and an extended partition with one linux-swap , one ext3 , and one FAT32 as logicals . The BIOS intermittantly finds the drive now . More often than not when I go to the BIOS setup to move the plugged-in Pocket Drive to the top of the priority list , it isn't even on the list . Knoppix gets a different and unknown ID from the drive ( very unusual ) . Win XP finds the drive and allows manipulation of the contents of only one of the two partitions ( logical partition is missing ) . To re-emphasize , for anyone operating the Seagate Pocket within its limitations , it is a good , decently-performing device . But to anyone with even a hint of geekiness , this is an unsatisfactory purchase . I 'll probably be returning mine today .  
2	  I live in a bottom floor apartment on the end of the building away from Direct TV transmitters . When I prepared for the switch to DTV , I installed a converter box from Radio Shack along with a DTV antenna . It worked , but not reliably due to the nature of DTV signals being better in ' line of sight ' applications , low gain , and disruption when people move around in the room . I had to constantly adjust the antenna , which was pretty directional in it 's design . I had to admit I made a poor choice in my haste to switch . I looked around for an alternative and found the DB2 . Yes , it is an outdoor antenna , and I cannot install it outside at my apartment , but it turns out to be livable . I have it mounted on the post of an old torchiere lamp near the TV . The reason I bought it is because of the high gain and Multi Directional nature of the design . It works far better than the last antenna I tried . I don't receive all the signals I could receive if I lived in the top floor closest to the transmitters , but the channels I receive are solid , clear pictures without needing to move the antenna all over the place . I also suggest that if you have any understanding of the nature of analog broadcast signals , that you look up the nature of digital broadcast signals . They are different in performance and may help you understand what to do to increase the quality of your receiving installation , especially if your are in a fringe area . The DTV website was very helpful to me .  
2	  I got the Sony MVC-FD75 as a gift for christmas and im so happy with it and the pics it takes . Its so easy to use and with a floppy disk you can e-mail pics much faster then with a camera with port cables you have to hook up to your PC .  
2	  I was looking for some speakers to play with my IPod , and someone recommended the Panasonic Folding Travel Speakers ( RPSPT70 ) . Based on all of the reviews , i was confident that these speakers were what i was looking for , and i was right . The sound quality is amazaing . In one review , someone said that there is a humming noise on very low volume , but i did not notice this on my speakers . Also , some reviews said that the speakers come with an AC adaptor .. the ones bought off of Amazon do not . Pros : - Very compact-Excellent sound quality-Decent Bass-Good Volume-VERY VERY CHEAP ! Cons : - The cord is very short-The speaker 's stand is small , and they fall over is the cord is slightly pulled-the volume is controlled from the music player , and not the speakers . Overall these speakers have amazing sound quality for being so tiny , and cheap . Do not be skeptical in buying these . They are worth every Cent !  
2	  The webcam is easy to setup and use . The clarity and function are both good , it can keep track of faces and autofocus which is a very nice feature . The logitech software update has some nice features also , autolighting adjustments , a function to use the webcam to record movement when you are away . Overall much more than what you can expect from a cheap webcam .  
2	  Excellent , Good , Fair , Reasonable , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah .  
2	  this mouse has been improved on every parts from MX1000 except one , the surface of the mouse make you fell very sticky if you have sweaty hands like me .  
2	  I love the feel and the accuracy of the mouse but I wanted to program one of the buttons to open the Windows start menu and you can't do it .. Other than that its cool  
1	  This ink came up in a search for pixma ip3000 , but it is not compatible . The ink itself could be fine for the printers it is compatible for .  
2	  We both enjoy having a small , lightweight radio with headphones and have tried a few other brands . This one is lightweight , easy to use and gets very good reception for a small radio . We first bought one and then decided to order two more to have " a spare " when we need it .  
2	  This is the charger you want for your Garmin . The aftermarket chargers just don't get the job done . That means they don't work with Garmins .  
1	  The number buttons are not responsive enough for three digit channels . It takes several attempts for all of the numbers to register . Also the device mode has issues with the power button staying in activity mode . For that reason , you cannot power on or off a specific device without the remote assuming power settings for the other devices .  
1	  The Epson Stylus C82 , C84 , and C86 are good for a short time only , maybe one year tops when purchased new . Then , the nozzles clog , the printer becomes useless junk . Epson no longer will repair these old models . This creates a problem for those of us using older computers like my Apple imac OS 8.6 , as there are no longer any printers available that work with these old computers .  
1	  I would caution you to not use this product . This is the second one I have used . I thought the first one was just defective so dummy me I bought another one . So , instead of losing one family video I now have had two vidoes destroyed by this machine twisting the tape . I saved the tape and hope to maybe find someone who can salvage some of it as memories cannot be redone . It played three fourths of my home Christmas video and then the tape got twisted in it . Like I said I gave it a second chance by purchasing two . I 'm writing this review in hopes of preventing someone else losing their memories .  
1	  I purchased this item to watch some old movies of my kids . I watched ONE tape and the unit stopped working . I tried everything I could to get it to work , but could not . When I finally thought I had it fixed , I put it in the VCR and it jammed the entire machine . Had to pry it out . Don't waste your money .  
2	  I really like this DVD Juke Box . I actually purchased 2 of them , and have turned a few friends on to it as well . The picture is awesome on my TV ! It has an on screen menu of the movies that really is a good idea , but this one needs some help . The remote is a joke ! Why can't the guys at Sony do better ? Great way to keep your movies in good condition , and you really save on storage space if you have a lot of movies . If you can get for under $ 300 , it 's a really good deal !  
1	  I wouldn't recommend the purchase of this card . It 's totally unreliable as it suddenly stopped working . I got a message in my camera saying " Memory Card Error " . There 's no point of saving a few bucks if you lose all your pictures !  
2	  I have been carrying around dearest Canon Powershot S50 since September of 2003 , after tearing myself from an elderly Minolta camera my Father owned about thirty years ago . Prior to purchasing the digital camera , I did a hefty amount of research to ensure myself that I was indeed purchasing a product that would last . After comparing countless cameras to one another through the Internet and shopping centers , I settled on the Powershot S50 . The camera ( overall ) is incredibly easy to operate , and provides the user with an immense amount of features to explore and expand upon . I quickly learned how to decide on a specific shooting mode for each shot , without much fuss . I also found it very simple to become comfortable and confident while shooting manually with the S50 . This digital camera produces vibrant colors and crisp images with almost every photograph or snapshot taken . The automatic white balance ( with or without setting it yourself ) compliments each shot , and allows for flexibility . There is rarely a need to adjust anything more than the brightness and contrast of a photograph in Photoshop , which is not the case for many other digital cameras . S50 is also capable of functioning well without a flash in a low-lit environment ! The body of the S50 is a perfect size , sturdy , and survived ( with only one small scratch ) a dreadful fall on the kitchen ceramic tile . Also , the LED screen placed on the backside of the camera allows the user to see what exactly they are photographing . There is no need to worry in regards to loading S50s software on a Mac , or PC . Both are " user-friendly " and will not be found troublesome ! Aside from all of the upsides to purchasing the camera , there are , of course , minor ( but worth mentioning ) issues I was and am not satisfied with . I have not experienced anything negative with the sliding lens cover as other reviewers have , but can agree with its ( occasionally ) slow reaction time . I have missed a shot I desired to capture on more than one occasion because S50 did not react quickly enough . Along with this , I have and continue to struggle with the usage of the flash . Photographs either appear too bright or not bright enough . I have yet to settle upon middle ground with S50 . However , Photoshop and other photography programs can easily adjust this issue if needed ( along with the commonly complained about red eye ) . The battery life is also an issue to struggle with . It is best to carry another with you , as the camera will not specifically indicate when it will be out of battery power . I would recommend this camera to anyone in need of a reliable buy , as well as a larger memory card ( mine being 256MB ) . You will have a point-and-shoot camera as well as a semi-pro manual camera combined into one , with a terribly affordable price for all of its functions .  
2	  This memory made me a bit Queasy at first when I clicked BUY . Well , Lets just say i run many windows , many programs , and still have time for gaming . ITS MY video Card that is the culprit ..  
1	  Already had THREE RMAs . The first happened about 2 months after purchase . Windows wouldn't boot up , " Disk Read Error , Please restart . " sent it in for RMA . 3 weeks later they sent it back . EXACT SAME PROBLEM . They didn't Fix a THING . No Documentation NOTHING . Complained a lot . 2nd RMA and they finally fixed it . Couple weeks later , the screen developed bright vertical lines across it . Bending the flimsy screen develops other lines . Tech support tells me to reinstall drivers or do a system restore . They are UTTERLY USELESS . It 's OBVIOUSLY a hardware problem due to the flimsy screen . Sent it in for THIRD RMA . They tell me they need to do a system restore . They send it back . I boot up . Windows error message : " Windows cannot start because the file comdlg32 . dll cannot be found . Re-installing the application may fix this problem " . AND ANOTHER ONE : " the system is not fully installed . Please run setup again . " on top of that , the CD drive cannot be detected so I can't even boot from the CD . BUY THEIR LAPTOP ONLY IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE HELL . ~ ~ Additionally , their email support is horrendously disorganized . Firstly , a different person responds to your email each time . I 've had tech support people tell me conflicting things . After I was issued my 3rd RMA , I emailed again to warn them of another issue that developed . In the email back , " Paul " here renounced my RMA and issued an inquisition of questions reguarding my purchase . RIDICULOUS .  
2	  This is the third Logan Slide File that I have ordered . Good product for the purpose for which it was designed .  
2	  This item was purchased to be given as a gift . From what I was told it works beautifully ; from what I read B & W is ranked among the best filter makers so it should be a charm ..  
1	  Amazon should really quit selling this piece of cr * p . The fans only work sometimes . I 've had my laptop overheat while using it . Buy something else . Don't spend it on this !  
2	  They look big and bulky and but fit my head just fine . The only 2 things I had a problem with is you can't turn the volume up very loud ( although I must say that it is loud enough for listening to music unless it was recorded at a low volume ) and if you wear them much more than about 2 hours they start hurting your ears . Each side was adjustable so I had no problem getting them to fit my head comfortably . Not sure about the microphone because I haven't had a use for it yet but I would reccommed these to amyone .  
2	  This product performs as advertised . It extends network and internet access throughout your office or home without the hassle of hard wiring . Setup is fairly straightforward . We are using it with a cable modem , a server and 4 worksations ( 2 of which are wireless ) . I recommend the Wireless USB Adapter ( WUSB11 ) rather than than the wireless card for laptops .. the reception is much greater .  
1	  the sound on these is garbage . i enjoy bass in my music and being able to hit all ranges . however , the sound quality on these is extremely poor . if you like purely treble in your music they would not be a bad choice .  
2	  Heard about these speakers on XM Radio and decided to buy and try them . When I got them was surprised at how easy to connect and the sound . Sound is just Fantastic . My laptop never sounded so good with all the music I have downloaded . Recommend these to anyone useing a laptop at home .  
2	  I read the ratings and it helped me make an informed decision . The set up took a little while to figure out and optimize , but they work great once you check everything . My advise if you have one TV and need to keep the volume down , buy these . Make sure to try out different locations for the receiver base to get the best reception . Also base needs to be away from electrical outlets and other wireless devices . The controls are very good as is the fit .  
1	  I liked this player .. when it actually worked . Unfortunately at the 1.5 year mark it slowly start fading away . At first I thought it was a broken remote but when I bought a universal remote , it didn't improve anything . The unit no longer responds to remote controls while the buttons on the main unit still work . This doesn't really make life easy since there are only 3 buttons on the main unit . I believe this is due to shoddy worksmanship since I 've read similar things about the previous model in this line dying after 1 year . What sucks is that I 'm just outside the warranty period ( of 1 year ) . I 'm never buying Philips again .  
1	  I really can't write a review about this router , but I am able to write a case review concerning Linksys 's handling of my return of a defective router . My router was DOOB ( dead out of box ) . No problem ! Send it back and get a new one . My mistake going to Linksys instead of returning through Amazon . Linksys tech phone help was GREAT even though I had to wait many minutes behind other customers . I was told I would receive an email on the following Monday ( this was a weekend ) with an RMA form to fill out and return by email . Following these instructions would allow shipment of a new unit . The email did not arrive until I prodded Linksys for it and then a customer rep responded to tell me she would send the RMA form later ( a personal reply , not an auto-reply ) . WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST ATTACH IT TO HER REPLY ? The email with attached form came two days later . I completed the form and returned it by email since I do not own a fax machine and was not about to place the form in snail mail . That was the last I have heard from Linksys in two weeks . Today is three weeks since I called and spoke to the tech . UNSATISFACTORY.I will be returning this through Amazon where I am ALWAYS GUARANTEED satisfactory service . ( and they 've proven it continuously ) I won't buy another Linksys product in the near future and I would not recommend them at this time . I am afraid of their support team . Very afraid ! I hope this is an isolated event . If not .. bye bye !  
2	  Connects my car to my mp3 player ( dell dj ditty ) and the cord is long enough to reach the back seat . No problems at all .  
1	  This hard drive is a piece of junk - actually an insult to a piece of junk because at least a piece of junk doesn't look like it will work . There should be a reasonable chance that a drive will work out of of the box . The other problem , noted by one is that Seagate 's customer support is non-existent except in theory . I wouldn't buy any external Seagate drive that uses plug in modules on the bottom ( the drives came with USB and Firewire modules that neatly plug into an SATA base plug . The modules have a power inlet and the cable end of choice . This is not random hatred for Seagate . I have two mirrored Seagate 750s in my Apple G5 , an upgrade Seagate in a MacBook Pro . There are other Seagates around internal and external . I 've never seen a disaster like this one . Seagate bailed my G5 out of a problem caused by WD SATA incompatibility . I bought the first of these drives to carry on a trip out of the country where I needed a second large storage drive . As it 's a MAC , the software didn't matter . I bought this drive , fortunately , at Costco . I installed the Firewire Module , and voila , a dead drive . Being throrough , I tried to USB module . Worked fine . Not what I needed . ( or paid for ) . A friend who 'd purchased and identical drive lent me his Firewire module . I installed it . The drive worked . I left without the drive , but began sending e-mail to Seagate . At that point , all I needed was a module and I 'd need the storage when I got home . Seagate 's support system is an archaic idiotic mess geared primarily to produce automated answers that aren't helpful . It would keep sending responses to responses saying comments were in the wrong place ( not true ) and therefore not accessible . The full comments would be attached in the area where they supposed weren't attached . Very specific on the need only for a module because the problem was very specifically isolated . Seagate said they needed more specific details , but that was impossible . I gave up on Seagate after nine days in which it became clear that customer support was handled in a place where English looked good , but didn't understand basic technical English , requiring me to spell out DOA and NFG . It isn't easy to do anything other than return a complete drive as box , even if you 're just missing a cable . I tried to get a return athorization . The system kicked it out which meant I 'd have to work my way through autocall when I got back . Instead , I returned the drive to Costco which provides the valuable right to return for 90 days . I would buy a lot less electronics from them without that . They took the drive back and I still had the need , so my wife , who did the work , brought two new drives home . One of them was DOA with both modules . The other had a dead Firewire module . They went back to Costco the same day and thinking it had to be a fluke , I bought a fourth drive . Another Firewire failure . It went back and I 've determined this a Seagate that is too risky to use . It 's obvious that there is Zero quality control on the modules . I 'm no longer sure about the drive quality ( an end to Maxtor competition may be a factor ) . My concern was that the drive itself would fail , or that the modules would fail , leaving me the choice of having Seagate destroy my data for the sake of replacing the external module on the drive . Kudos to Costco for doing the right thing . Curse you to Seagate for producing such garbage and destroying your reputation with me . I have better luck with cheap third party enclosures that don't look as good , but they consistently work . If this were a single drive failure , I 'd take it as one of those rare events . I see the other reviewer with problems similiar to mine or others I know . This is a serious product failure and Seagate is refusing to deal with it . If you choose to ignore the problems , at least be sure you deal with someone who has a solid DOA return policy without shipping charges or at leat limited . Check it immediately . Send it back it if it doesn't work . Don't waste your time with Seagate support .  
2	  HP software has long driven me crazy . Hp hardware , on the other hand , almost always works well . My Designjet 130NR was a reasonably priced solution for a small design office . The ink cartridges last a long time . Good product .  
1	  My friends have the E3C and love them so I thought the E4C with tuned port ( yes , I was thinking Bose too when I read that ) would be even better . Fact is , the buds that came with my iPod sound better . The EC4s have NO bass . When I upped the bass they quickly got distorted . The upper-mids and highs are excellent - no doubt about that . But for $ 200 this should be an ALL AROUND great set of earphones . In that respect they fall very short .  
2	  My biggest gripe was the padded piece that locks into your ear fell off . I just had the sinking feeling , I 'll be walking / running around in a few weeks with earphone that won't stay in or hurt my ears cause the padding is gone . I would buy the back of the head wrap around or over the ears if I had to buy another pair . The case isn't to practical either . It has a magnetic closure on top and would make a good coin purse for a kid if it closed completly , but it doesn't . I find my self wraping it around my mp3 player and placing it in my pocket where I run into loosing the padding . Now that I spit out my vinegar . The sound is awesome very crisp and clean and that is why I gave it a high score . I think if you are organized and can keep them from getting tangled by putting them away properly anyone will enjoy these earphone . However if you wad them up put in your pocket . You may want to consider a more durable design . I would challenge the manufactuer to come up with a design for a case that is more practical and keeps the cords from getting tangled . But I guess thats everybodies problem till the industry goes cordless .  
1	  I love my 4350 imageclass , just like I loved the 4100 . I am a very high-volume printer for my law office , where we have 2 of these . It seems like the Canon 104 Toner cartridges used to last a lot , lot longer . Is it my imagination or in the past several months do they print less and less ? What a racket . We are going to have to ditch both of these printers . We 've had them for years , and if anything the volume we put out of them has gone down , yet we are changing the cartridges every couple of weeks where it used to be every couple of months - I truly believe something has changed with the 104 's . Am I off base ?  
2	  These cables perform as expected but I do not like the release mechanism . They are a little difficult to release in tight spaces where you may not be able to see or get more than one finger in . If you plan on installing these in a rack and rarely / never removing them , they 're fine , but for offices or travel , I would not recommend them .  
2	  I bought this last November . Since then , I 've watched a wide variety of movies on it . Everything from B & W ; oldies to the latest films . The effect is incredible . It 's like owning your own movie theater . I 'm surprised more people aren't using these things instead of buying big-screen TVs . The Optoma is light , small , portable , very easy to use , and gives wonderful picture and sound . A big TV has a way of " becoming " the room . With this , when you 're done with it , you can just put it away . The only fault it has is that ( unlike a big TV ) you need a darkened room to view the picture . If that isn't a problem , this might be for you . I don't own a movie screen . I project my image onto a white wall . The image I get is about 14 feet wide . With older films , the picture almost stretches from floor to ceiling . Few gadgets have really changed my life , this one has . It has rekindled my love for great movies . I can see details and sense the power in the images that I 've missed on TVs .  
2	  We live in the shadow of a hill . I installed a big Winegard HD7084P antenna on a chimney mount and we pulled in all the channels we needed , but a few were a little iffy and needed some twiddling of the antenna rotator . Our DTV converter box reported at most 52 channels with some channels hovering around 14 % on the antenna meter . During some weather conditions we were losing signal and missing the two or three shows we watch a week . I didn't want to go through the hassle of installing a preamp on the mast , so I bought the Motorola amp . The unit feels solid . I like the gold-plated connectors , especially the weather-sealed coax power connector . I hooked everything up , rescanned , and got 70 + channels . The borderline 14 % channel is now regularly reporting 54 % strength with no pixelation or dropouts . Everything else up to 70 % and 80 % . I 'm very pleased with this unit 's ease of installation , build quality , and performance . It 's one of the best A / V purchases I 've made .  
2	  I have taken many many pictures on this card . It runs very fast in my SLR , and is a very good card . SanDisk makes some good stuff . I get very fast Bursts of pictures in my Canon SLR , and overall , the card has performed great ! I would totally recommend this .  
2	  I was trying multiple different methods to extend IR into a different room for the stubborn Time Warner cable boxes . Every IR extender solution I implemented either would drop button presses or just not send them . I tried this solution as a last ditch effort and it works like a champ ! The only thing I had issues with was repeated keypresses seemingly being sent to the cable box . I read the FAQ and backed the emitter station away from the receiver a little and have no problems at all . I returned over $ 100 in in-wall IR receivers , controllers and emitters and now solely use this .  
2	  My brother recommended it to me after using it for about a year . I 've been using it for months now and it 's great . It does make noise but compared to the one i bought before ( I wish i remember the product name but I don't .. ) , it 's not bad at all . In the privacy of your room , it 's audible but you can't hear it when you are out in public . I 'd recommend this to anyone who wants a cooler . I donno how i lived without it .  
2	  I purchased these binoculars for use on a 30 foot fishing boat . They work great . The image is clear and when I activate the stabilization , I can read caution and slow notice signs from a long way off . I know that some reviewers have concerns about them not being waterproof . As long as you don't drop them in the water , they seem fine .  
1	  My order for this item was canceled by amazon for no reason . So I am looking elsewhere .  
2	  For the money I don't think you will find a better camcorder . I 've had mine for about a week & I 'm very happy with it . I think you could spend alot more for digital and not get asmany useful features . Basically its very easy to use but alsocontains some advanced functions . Picture quality is outstanding . Sony really outdid itself on this one .  
1	  I placed an order for two of these cables and after waiting a few days , i got only one in the mail . I had to contact the seller and request a refund for the other one . When I tried using the cable , it was broken , I had to contact the seller again and communicate the problem , he offered the money back but by now paying for shipping would not make any since . The cable costs less that the shipping i would Have had to pay . Please Don't buy this cable , buy Belkin even if you have to pay more , at least you would get a quality product .  
2	  i love this camcorder ! very good transactions . i have no complaints & would do business with this company again ! thanks  
1	  has firmware issues , will NOT allow port forwarding because of buggy firmware that hasn't been fixed for 18 months ! don't expect a firmware upgrade to fix it ; furthermore , the new version v1444 has packet loss issues and will not be a good wireless bridge  
1	  I bought the camera three weeks ago and it was fine , i know have a problem with it , it comes on but will not do anything . it acts like a computer that has locked up , after 9 calls later someone finally called me back from vivitar and explained to me that they could fix it for $ 80 . ? . ? i asked about the warranty and they continued with the plastic case was under warranty .. Help  
2	  I have been using the headset that came with my Panasonic cordless phone for many years now ( at least five , perhaps more ! ) I have tried other headsets , but they all were either uncomfortable or sounded bad . The vinyl over the ear cushion was peeling , but it still worked - until the headband finally snapped . It didn't owe me anything . I was delighted to see that the exact same headaset , as best as I can tell , is still sold as the KX-TCA60 . I bought two and the comfort and sound quality is excellent . I agree with the other reviewers who ask " why pay more ? " .  
2	  I have had this little guy for just about 3 months now and am loving it to the Nth degree ! It is light and compact , weighting in at just about 5oz , I believe . The interface between my computer and the Zen has been flawless , though the only way to charge the Zen is by installing the software onto the computer you are using . This is a slight downfall in that if you are visiting friends , and forgot to bring the disk with you , you may run out of battery life . However , the battery is removable in this particular Zen , so if you happen to purchase a battery charger that fits this little guy , then you should be good to go . This was a selling feature for me as I like to travel quite a bit internationally , and finding a random computer that doesn't cost $ 3 / min to use to charge my music player can be a toughie sometimes . That , and the fact that it is black with pretty blue neon lights . What can I say , I am color oriented . I have not had any trouble navigating through the options , thought to be perfectly frank , I have not really explored too many of them either . I have not tried to load up any pictures as I bought this primarily for the music purpose . The earphones that the item came with are not too bad . Not the greatest , and they do make the music a bit muffeled , but in a pinch they work just fine . I also bought the armband and have decided that it was worth the $ 6 so far .  
2	  I used a MoView arm before .. This product is patently better than the other . The arms have amazing range and strength . I am actually holding two 22 " monitors with these arms ( albeit the monitors are amazingly light ) . There is plenty of range to have larger monitors still presented side-by-side . The resistance of the arm is adjusted by an Allen wrench and definitely had more weight range than what I am putting on them . I keep my monitors in landscape mode though and haven't really tested their ability to rotate . I found the product just ingenious for the smallest details . The arms hold your cables so that they can be kept neat . The product came with laptop accessories in the event I wanted to use a one monitor , one laptop configuration , and it had plenty of supplies ( screws , velcro , etc )  
1	  The product is definitely not worth the money IMO . It 's smaller than my screen size and it doesn't stick tightly to the screen either .  
2	  There are 6 channels in my area near Charlottesville , VA . The stations are 6-7 miles from my home . I hooked this antenna to my HD TV , clicked my remote to run an automatic channel tune check . I immediately , with no adjustments , received all six channels , clear , or better , than cable . What more can I say . Cheap . Works well . No muss , no fuss . There are other channels , not closer than about 50 miles LOS , which I did not receive , so I can only vouch for 6-7 miles distant from my area .  
1	  Not loud enough . Battery doesn't last long enough . Maybe they will improve but right now don't buy .  
2	  This litle all-in-one printer is really Great , and the cd software intstall was a breeze . The Scan , Copy , and Print features on this thing are really Nice ! Its nice and compact and pretty much fits anywhere you put it , and it looks nice too . Most importantly the price was really nice at around $ 120 . dollars , you really cant beat that considering this things quality of work and reliablity !  
2	  I purchased a 30gb iPod Vid . some time ago . To start off , I have to say it 's great looking . The sound quality is amazing - I hook it up to my home theater system and it produces amazing sound quality and bass . The click wheel is super easy and is convenient for extended use - everything is right there . The quality of the graphics is very impressive - super bright and clear . With Videora iPod converter ( free ) , you can download or rip DVD 's and place ANY video file from ANY source by transcoding it . Now the Cons : This product is delicate . It is in no way " extreme " or " sporty " . Imagine you are buying a gem . This in fact is so delicate , that I would say that you might as well burn your $ 300.00 than buy one WITHOUT FIRST buying a cover or case . DO NOT USE THIS without buying a case please . I tell you this from experience . The 1st iPod video I bought was so scratched by the 3rd day , that you could no longer view your videos in acceptable quality . I ended up exchanging it some how ( hard thing to do ) , and getting a new one . BUT I didnt dare to use it until I bought a case by the brand " zcover " ( In my opinion , the best case out there - very usefull and protective ) . Basically , it 's being fragile is the only problem I found to it . Another thing is that I would go with the white iPod , which seems to show finger prints and scratches much less than the black . Overall , it really is worth it . IF you buy a cover with it . I use it at the gym , when I go out to run , in the car - everywhere . Its really light and given the fact that it has 30GB , i 'd say it pretty small . In my opinion , there is no other MP3 out in the market right now that matches the iPod video .  
1	  The slide show for this Opteka Digital frame freezes after just 1 hour of use . I tried both the internal memory and the external SD memory . No difference . Slide show was still freezing . The only option was to power it off and on to start the slide show again , and it will freeze again within the next 1 hour . I had only around 100 photos loaded . I have seen many reviews of this frame freezing up on slide show . So this is not 1 specific frame , but a general defect in the product . The manufacturer should recall this product . Also the frame heats up , unlike the Coby Digital frame which I have . The Coby frame slide show has not frozen up even a single time . I returned the frame back to Amazon and placed an order for Aluratek Digital frame . Please do not buy this product . However the picture quality is excellent .  
1	  The following is a recount of my personal experience with this Netgear product as well as my own opinions about the products usefulness . My background : I am a computer programmer with about 10 years of work experience and a 4.0 grade point average from an Ivy League school . I was not able to get this product to work with an IBM ThinkPad T22 running Windows XP . I got the infamous " Code 10 " problem that many others are seeing with this product . ( .. ) a google search for ' netgear wg511 " code 10 " ' to see more . Besides the problems that users are having , the technical support requires that you traverse " Bangalore Hell " , from which you will probably not receive the information necessary to fix the problem ( which , from the above posts , seems to be a driver software problem ) . I tried various versions of the drive software downloaded from Netgear , including the latest 2.7.0.0 driver . This was the latest software available as of July 17 , 2004 . I was never able to get my laptop to properly recognize the card . No combination of removing and reinstalling drivers , removing and reinserting the wireless card , or clearing out Windows registry keys helped . There is a reference to this problem on the Netgear website . However , it is terse and does not seem to offer a solution - none of the approaches listed helped solve my problem ( .. ) personal " solution " to the " Code 10 " issue was to pack up the Netgear router and card and return it to Amazon . I have since replaced it with a Linksys combination which worked right out of the box . I didn't even need to install software - Windows XP 's built in Wi-Fi support was all that was needed . Please note that this is only my personal experience and the experiences of various other anonymous posters on the Internet . It may not reflect every user 's experience ( or even the most common experience ) , and must be taken with a grain of salt . Thanks for reading all the way through ! :-) - ( .. )  
1	  The price has dropped quite a bit since I bought this . I liked it for the built in mic and iPod pause / advance button ( it functioned just like the set Apple gives you ) . The ear pieces were comfortable but mine just stopped working . There is a loose connection in the mic / pause button .  
1	  I had this player less than a month and the power button fell off . Rio / DNNA would not replace it saying it was damaged in a way not covered by the warranty . But don't just take it from me , according to the Better Business Bureau as of 01/31/06 : " Based on BB files , this company has an unsatisfactory record with the Bureau due to a pattern of complaints and has failed to correct the underlying reason for the complaints . Our records show that the company has a pattern of complaints concerning Product Quality . "  
2	  I wanted something simple and cost effective rather than a complicated collection of expensive stereo components just to listen to a few selected CDs and the local stations . This was perfect , and was easy to install . Love it .  
2	  the initial laser range finder that i wanted , which was less expensive , was listed but them became unavailable in two different stores . Finally i chose this one and it works just as well . I used it for measuring distances in fields and mountains so it is a little too high tech for our work , but it is an excellent piece of equipment nonetheless .  
2	  Just went finished recording with a couple of discs and so far everything works great . These discs are able to store up to 6 hrs of material , so I 'll be able to do plenty of recording . Also , the 30 discs package I got at just under twenty bucks is a GREAT deal . If you need some DVD + RW 's , these are a great choice .  
2	  I 've been wanting to create & upload my own ringtones without paying data charges & now I can . I figured for the price , it was worth a try . It was confusing to get started , though . First install the driver disk & have your phone " see " it , then go into services to find out which com ( serial ) port it has been assigned . Now open the Samsung software & manually assign the port - don't use auto discovery . Hope this helps ! I 'm happy !  
1	  I 'll keep it brief , as it disgusts me to think about this p . o . s . : - horrible battery life . will drain regular aa 's by taking four pictures , no joke . - corrupts memory card / deletes pictures at will . lost well over 300 pictures due to something ! - I don't know what . - shuts off randomly . you will be in the middle of taking a picture with new batteries and the thing will just turn off . sometimes , if youre lucky , it 'll turn back on . - poor picture quality / manual controls . i know this is not a professional camera , but I 've seen better picture quality on cameras in the same price range . Finally , after I put up with all this , it decided to stop working all together . So , the moral of the story is , no matter how cheap this thing is , DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA ! For that matter , I would never buy any camera from Gateway . Instead , let me recommed the Canon Powershot 3.2 camera . It has much better battery life ( i never changed them for three weeks while in Italy ) and it takes better pictures , even with lower resoultion .  
2	  This was my first portable GPS . The price was great for the features . The only issues I have found with this product is the satallite connection is slow at times in rural areas , and it is not compatiable with my cell phone . It would be nice to get directions to just a city without having to input an address .. it may be possible and I have not figured it out yet .. lolAll in all .. I am pleased !  
2	  Well , its a well made CAT6 cables and works perfect . Arrived in great conditions .. Oh and the heads are easy to plug and unplug and their cover protects it from breakage .  
1	  Apparently a replacement for the terrific 932c printer , this " upgraded " model is a bomb . Jams , can't print straight , picks up multiple sheets , and horrible service all add up to a misfire . I went through the hassle of getting two replacement units shipped to me , and both replacements had more problems than the original ! I 've written off my 940c . I don't think anyone should waste their time ( and certainly not their money ) on this one .  
1	  bought these memory cards for my older computer thinking it would speed it up a bit . spent half a day researching what the correct replacement memory cards would be and half a day reading reviews as to pick a reliable product . received memory card in a timely manner & installed them . started up computer and within minutes computer locks up . took these memory cards out reinstalled original cards and computer runs ok . so I tried the new memory cards again with the same result , a frozen computer . put the original cards back in and computer runs ok , slow but ok . so here I sit with my slow running computer with a lesson learned for $ 100.00 , don't bother trying to improve an older computer , just save up a few more dollars an buy a new one .  
2	  This is great if you want to just use your TV as your computer screen at fairly low resolution ( 800x600 is the highest I 'd use for a 32 " even though it supports greater ) . If you want to have fantasic resolution , this is not what you want ( instead you should buy a media-center type computer or a graphics card that has tv-out ) . There is some definitely fuzzyness , but I don't mind , being a child of the 1970 's and 80 's - I have seen much worse . I had been searching for something cheap so I could hook a computer up to the TV and use it to play music and some games ( note it doesn't do audio - you just have to plug the audio stuff up directly from your computer to your TV possibly through your VCR or in my case an RCA audio / video switch ) . I just had to plug it up and it worked without any configuration . It is powered by USB that hooks into the computer - so make sure your computer has a USB port . The device doesn't look like the picture shown here . It is a small silver box ( roughly 5 " x2 " x1 " ) that comes with all of the plugs you need . A word of warning , if you are trying to hook your computer up to your TV don't do what I did the first time and by a simple adapter of VGA to s-video / rca video output . It was $ 5 so I said what the heck , but learned later ( by experience and reading on the web ) that adapter won't work unless you hook it to a video card that already supports TV-out and have that card output at a TV resolution ( and the whole point of getting it was because I didn't have a video card that had tv-out ! So instead , just either buy a video card with tv-out or a device like this . Another note , if you go the video card route , be careful . I almost bought one , but saw that it needed at least a 250W power supply . I was using an old low profile PC with 90W power supply , so that wouldn't have worked .  
1	  YEP , I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN I GOT THIS RIO . IT WORKED GREAT , LOOKED COOLER THAN AN IPOD ( SUCKERS ) , THE ONLY THING THAT PISSED ME OFF STRAIGHT AWAY WAS THAT I COULDN'T MAKE A PLAY LIST WHEN OUT & ABOUT .. HOWEVER , I GOT OVER THAT . THE REST , MY GOD . I EVEN CONVINCED MY MATE TO GET ONE . BIG MISTAKE . I FEEL ITS MY FAULT . MINE GOT FAULTY ABOUT 6 MONTHS AFTER HAVING IT , IT WOULDN'T CHARGE PROPERLY , THEN MIRACULOUSLY STARTED CHARGING AGAIN ( ? ) .. HERS STARTED DOING THE SAME . NOW I CAN'T EVEN TRANSFER MUSIC TO IT , COMPUTERS DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEVICE AND THE DIVICE SEEMS NOT TOO BOTHERED ABOUT A COMPUTER EITHER .. SO .. WHO KNOWS , MAYBE ITS A COINSIDENCE , AS I SAID , ITS GOOD IN THE SHORT TERM .  
2	  I support many & # 34 ; older & # 34 ; computers , and this memory fits the bill when I need to improve performance without spending $ on a new computer .  
1	  I hope I save somebody the time and trouble of buying this piece of garbage . As some of the other reviewers have experienced , mine starting acting up after three months . I was told by the manufacturer that for $ 80 I should send it back for a " reconditioned " one . Went to Mail Boxes Etc .. and sent it back . I received the " new " one about three weeks later and I am having the same problem with this one . The kicker of this whole mess was the woman at Mail Boxes Etc .. told me that sometimes the same people send the machine back three to four times ! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS !  
1	  Apparently there 's some kind of driver incompatibility problem when trying to use an HP Cxi 820 printer , via this ( or any other ) conversion cable . I haven't been able to resolve it .  
2	  I wanted a camera that was not as heavy as the D200 or D300 . I am very happy with the D40 . The lens is a pretty good also . Together they are very easy to carry around . Good photos and accurate exposures from my point of view . I am an experienced amateur who takes a lot of family and floral photos . You will be very pleased with this camera and lens . I would also add the 55-200mm VR to complete the package .  
1	  I bought because it was cheap , but it didn't last long and I think it gunked up the heads . Got rid of the Lexmark , when I found a good deal on a brother laser printer at Walmart  
1	  THis is ok with space , but what would have been nice is if it came with a recharger , as it happens I tried to ask amazon if they could help me find one but they never got back to me . Rechargable batteries without a recharger is stupid .  
2	  Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8K 7.2MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom ( Black ) I recommend this product 100 % , is excellent !  
1	  Found this remote to be utterly useless . The software seems to require a fast internet connection to program it . I have one . Unfortunately the logitech server keeps failing . Expensive time wasting rubbish .  
1	  By far , the absolute WORST purchase I have EVER made in Electronic equipment ! The DVD player can't play over half the DVDs out there ( and I am NOT even including monoaural which is in excusable . ) It overheats in 2 seconds and I constantly have to un-plug and re-plug in the AC to reset the thing so that the sound comes on . Every time I get a new DVD , I have to cross my fingers and pray that it will work .. maybe 50 % of the time it does . I have another $ 39 DVD player I got from Target , that works better . Unfortunately it is WAY past the return date otherwise I would exchange this for a piece of equipment that wasn't such an over-hyped piece of garbage . I am STUNNED by the rave reviews people are giving this thing !  
2	  I recently moved to a new city and did not know the layout of where things were . I made a go at printing down maps and direction from google and the likes but somehow driving and looking at a piece of paper often led to a few scary moments , in came the nuvi 360 . Right off the bat the ability to program the directions and have the direction spoken to you as well as shown on a map made my getting around a simple feat . The garmin was simple and intuitive making it easy to understand and to use . Added to this was the food , gas feature which pointed the nearest gas station or your favorite eatery from your present location . I definetly recommend this product to anyone interested .  
2	  THIS ITEM HAS GREAT SOUND QUALITY . IT HAS THE BEST SOUND QUALITY OF ANY OF THE MICROCASSETTE RECORDERS , I HAVE TRIED . THIS PACKAGE OFFERS YOU THE MOST IMPORTANT OPTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED , TO OPERATE EASILY AND EFFECTIVELY . THESE RECORDERS ARE NOT FOR RECORDING MUSIC , BUT FOR RECORDING VOICE . THIS ONE DOES IT EXCEPTIONALLY WELL.I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THIS UNIT AND IF YOU PURCHASE ONE ? I AM SURE YOU WILL ALSO BE IMPRESSED !  
2	  Pros : easy set up , lightweight , not too big , backlit , good help menu on the LCD screen on the remote , very smart remote ! Cons : button layout is not the best , burns through batteriesLove this remote ! This is my first ' real ' Universal Remote so I do not have much to compare to . Set up was easy for me through the USB cable and online set up . just make sure you follow the large format , 1 sheet , fold out ' quick install guide ' manual the comes with . Write down all your components / devices Model numbers first , then install software , plug in the USB cable to the remote , register an account , and start the set up . pretty easy . NOT SURE WHY SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE SET UP ! IT 'S EASY ! Love using just one remote to control all my 5 devices ! This thing is smart and you tweak any of the buttons to do just about whatever you want them to do . I have only had it for two weeks when I wrote this , so I cant speak of how long it takes to eat the batteries , but I imagine with the LCD screen the batteries wont last long . but that is to be expected with any remote like this . just get good quality rechargeable AA 's . Buttons could be laid out better . would like the " prev " , " exit " , and " guide " buttons to be larger and located better . I picked this up new , from Amazon for $ 65 , so I got a great deal . I wouldnt pay more than $ 100 for this remote , but is a steal at $ 65 . all in all I luv it ! serves the purpose it was made for .  
1	  I bought this tripod several years ago but have only used it a FEW times for special circumstances . I was planning to snap photos of a lunar eclipse last night only to have 3 of the leg clamps break off tiny pieces at the hinges rendering it useless . I was utterly shocked . I had really been pleased with this tripod up until that happened . Upon reading other reviews , I discovered that this is a common occurrence . I bought it on a whim while in a photo supply store . Next time I will be researching first . I warn other potential buyers to do the same .  
2	  Easy to use and easy to install . Worked immediately with no problems . Very nicely put together .  
2	  This item is made for primarily PDAs . I use it for my Dell streak which fits perfectly and has more storage room for me to keep my stylus , Gerber , and notepad . great product , More sturdier than I though . A +  
2	  authomatic , AP , SP , manual mode .. autofocus , manual .. flash , connector to ext . flash8 OPTICAL ZOOM ! works as CF-readercool rotatind lens .. great remote .. 2Mp for me is enough .. i do not know about you  
1	  No matter what station I used , blank or occupied , I got some static ; and in loud parts of the song , the sound shorted out , even though it doesn't output sound very loud at all .  
1	  After purchasing this camera , I was rather disappointed at the quality of the images after I had uploaded them on to my PC . As a result , i took it back to the shop immediately , and exchanged it for the Canon Expo 4MP equivalent in price , which I can not be happier with . It is superb .  
2	  This is the only player I found that will upconvert DVDs to 1080i over component for a decent price . Mine has a built date of February 2005 and upconverted all my store bought DVDs to 1080i over component straight out of the box .. no firmware necessary . Definitely a buy if Amazon gets anymore in stock .  
1	  Unfortunately , the Beyerdynamic DT770 PRO 250 OHM are not a good choice for professional users . I had problems with low end distortion within two years of purchasing . I sent them for servicing via the warranty cover and received the headphones back with a fresh set of ear-pads , but with exactly the same technical issues . Last week , one of the drivers died , inexplicably , dead , nada , nothing . They are out of warranty now , so how much for repairs ? Quoted 70.00 by UK distributor ! the same lot that gave me fresh earpieces in place of fixing the driver the first time around . The build quality , relative to price , is poor , they are not in the same class as the DT100 and sound worse . These are hi-fi headphones , don't be fooled by the " Pro " descriptor . Additionally , the large hollow plastic ear pieces are a problem insofar as any cable movement / taps ( including head movements ) etc . sends resonance directly to the earpiece shell , I found this very annoying in critical listening situations . If I were to buy Beyerdynamic headphones again ( which I won't ) I would opt for the DT150 , the have a much flatter response and provide good bass extension without being boomy . You hear a lot of talk about the DT770 PRO having issues with " recessed mids , " I have to agree with this , another problem if you are looking for accurate results . I found them useful for picking out upper range nuances when having to work at less than optimum levels with monitors , but that 's about it . Prior to owning this set I had a set of AKG K240S which worked perfectly for 10 years . Very neutral sound , accurate , with great build quality , and now with a detachable cable , so I am about to purchase a pair for only $ 99 , 10 less than getting the DT770 repaired . Avoid this product if you are looking to spend your hard earned cash on a good pair of workhorse headphones , they will let you down eventually .  
2	  I 'm on the shorter side and although me feet touch the floor , I find myself propping them on my trash can under my desk , on top of my computer tower , or bending them back to rest on the feet of my chair . Just a few days with this underfoot and I 've noticed my legs don't ache as badly . Very comfortable ! I could lower my chair , but then my arms are uncomfortable at my keyboard . This allows me to even stretch my legs and rest them comfortably without having to slouch in my chair to find a comfortable spot for my legs . I sit straighter now because I 'm not straining to move my legs to the next position .  
2	  This adapter provided a clean solution for my DIY project to install an HD radio kit in my car . Most car audio head units ( mine included ) do not have the capability to deactivate the internal AM / FM tuner after installing a compatible HD radio kit . Installing a HD radio kit requires use of the vehicle antenna-the problem is there is one antenna connection and two tuners . This kit readily enables you to have both tuners working . There are several reasons why : ( 1 ) avoids the " dead " source on your head unit ( static noise ) , ( 2 ) enables one to compare station and tuner quality ( internal AM / FM vs . the HD unit ) , ( 3 ) avoids " .. there 's something wrong with your radio " when someone else drives your vehicle , and ( 4 ) allow you to go back to regular AM / FM on your favorite station because sometimes the regular ( non HD ) audio may sound better than the HD version depending on the CODEC being used by the radio station . Depending on your area radio stations , HD radio can sound anywhere from near CD quality to very bad MP3 sound . The Metra 40-UV44 adapter let 's you enjoy the best of both worlds and is one I consider a must have adapter if your car audio system does not allow you to deactivate the internal tuner .  
1	  I bought these as a phones for my iPod to use at the gym . I was looking for a phone that would stay in my ear during exercise , and that would block out distracting sounds around me at the gym . These are not bad , on both counts . The sound quality is at the upper end of medocre . They 're not what I would call " audiophile quality " phones . I also have a pair of Shure E4c , which , while more expensive , provide much superior sound quality , and superior sound isolation . Why did I give them only one star ? It 's because over time , under what I 'd consider pretty normal use , the insulation on the wire is beginning to crack . Pretty poor product integrity , and certainly not to be expected with a set of phones at this price ! The Lansing is reasonably comfortable , but it does take some getting used to any phone that fits inside the ear canal . They come with a volume / tone adjustment gadget attached to the wire , which I don't believe is worth its weight . In fact , I can't see any real , practical value to this added feature at all . It 's more convenient to adjust the volume at the iPod than to fool with this weighty thing that 's pulling on your ears . There is a clip that can be used to afix it to your clothing , but I still find it awkward , and even clipped to a collar , clumsy to use . These phones come with a storage fob that is large , cumbersome , and bulky . It pivots open and closed . You stash the phones and control in a circular storage area , wind the wire around the spindle , and close it . It 's bigger than my iPod . All in all , I think these are decent phones . But when you 're paying nearly a hundred bucks , I think that you SHOULD be getting something special . These are , well , just okay , despite some big drawbacks , namely the inferior , non-durable wire , the heavy ( and not very useful ) volume control , and the clumsy carrying case . As with any sound isolating phone , they should NOT be used where you might encounter a dangerous situation , like driving , cycling , etc . , where you need to hear sounds around you for your safety .  
2	  You get what you pay for when you buy the Palm m100 . Although it doesn't have any fancy features , it has all the basic needs you would want from an electric organizer . The m100 is overall easy to use , and very practical . It is small , so can fit easily into your purse or glove compartment . The biggest problem that I have with it is the weak flip cover , which I prefer to keep off . The Palm m100 also has some fun features . You can choose the font and alarm sound . There are also a variety of face plates so you don't always have to have the same boring black . This palm pilot is a great , affordable gadget for the hi-tech type person . The graffitti if easy to learn , the phonebook is easy to use , and there are also some great games . I would say that the palm m100 is a great buy !  
1	  I purchased the model several years ago . I 'd been quite happy with it , it worked on my PCs or my Macintoshs . The problem now is Canon has not kept up with the drivers on the Macintosh and since I don't use PCs anymore this unit is dead weight . Searching the Internet for alternate drivers shows me many other people have the same issue with driver software and there seems to be no alternatives . It is not USB 2.0 compatible BTW . It was not designed to be .  
1	  I love the size and potiential of this camera . The fact that I could use my old lens was what caused me to only look at Canon Cameras . PROBLEM : White Balance was way off . When I took pictures , the blues did not come through . For example , I took one picture of a fortress in Corfu , Greece that had a background of a blue sky with a few white clouds with the new Canon XT and my wife 's $ 300 5mp Sony . The Sony showed blue skies and white clouds and the Canon showed all grey skies . No distinction between the clouds and the sky . I shoot this in the automatic ( green square ) mode . I worked with the professional photogragher on our cruise ship and he agreed there was a problem . I returned the camera and obtained a refund . I was disappointed . One final comment : I am not a professional photographer so this could be pilot error !  
2	  This battery charger works well . The Sony rechargeable batteries lasted a long time in my digital camera . The only thing this charger is missing is a battery refresh to drain any charge left in your batteries before you recharge . That is why I only gave it a rating of 4 .  
2	  The sound from this card is definitely better thanwhat my IBM T41 laptop can put out . The T41 haspretty decent sound , but it cannot process soundin the sophisticated way this card can do . So it'sreally a significant step up . The only issue is a headphone cannot produce the soundeffects of 4 , 5 , 6 or 7 speakers , which this card can do ! And it 's unlike that I will ever hook up my laptop toa full sound system . So it 's a great product but somewhat unwieldy to harnessits full capability in normal daily use with my laptop beingmoved around so often .  
2	  I was looking for something small that didn't need batteries or en extension chord that could be portable and still be serviceable for MP3s at low to reasonable volume in my home office . This is USB powered , and connects to a PC tablet or smart phone . I preferred a 1-piece system , but the pair will stick together thanks to the magnetic front of each speaker . The sound quality is surprisingly good for such a low price . I * don't * need high volume - if you need high volume or will be across a room , these aren't right for you . If you max out the volume ( and bear in mind the control will be on your media device , not the speakers themselves ) you 'll still be able to hear yourself think . 25 % and you can talk on the phone without being distracted . 50 % and you can speak with someone in the room . 100 % is a little loud for sitting at your desk - 75 % max is fine if you are alone . To take them with you , stick them together ( remember , they are magnetic ) and put them in their bag . Take them with your laptop or tablet . Excellent for the desk or hotel room , even the car if you are travelling and have a USB port . They are good - very good - for what they are : desk speakers that are portable and don't require an outlet or batteries .  
1	  This camera is really a bad one from the canon . I have bought other canon cameras those were excellent but this particular camera frustrated me as it costs me my attention , time and money for nothing  
1	  Caused blue screen of death on new Toshiba satellite laptop . Two hour 's help from Belkin 's telephone support failed to fix the problem . I returned it and bought the Toshiba docking station instead , which is what I should have bought in the first place .  
1	  The transmitter light when connected to the Transmitter adapter and then plugged into the power will not stay on . It fades out and then nothing is possible . I spent a lot of time trying to get them to work ( going to Radio Shack ) and finally returned them The replacement was EXACTLY the same problem . There will not be a third time ! Bad Bad Bad .  
1	  There are plenty of other sleeves to choose from ; don't choose these . Both were ripped at the corners when I opened the box , and they only included one clear cover to protect the screen . Useless if you 're giving one of the sleeves to someone else .  
2	  I use this as a backup VHF for my sloop . The quality is excellent , especailly voice quality both sending and recieving . Battery life is fantastic . I like to keep mine in my pocket and use it as needed instead of reaching for the regular VHF mike on my boats 's primary VHF . Squelch is automatic and this feature really works well . Good way to get NOAA weather reports too . Buy one or two , just remember it is not a ' survival ' radio , it can't be submerged ( You could put it in a waterproof bag though ) .  
1	  I thought this was going to be a neat product . I had high hopes . However , disappointment reigns supreme . I bought and received the product , installed the software , transferred some files and listened . Good sound , easy to use , acceptable controls , all seemed fine . After a few days something changed . Files no longer transferred and the JetAudio software could not " see " the player 's flash memory to reformat it despite recognizing that it was connected and indicating that it was working correctly . Reinstalling the software did nothing to help . I will admit that my computer software changes constantly . I use my computer extensively . I update the operating system and virus protection programs regularly as well as the other software components on the system . The problem could be software or hardware , there is no way to tell . The diagnostics from the JetShell software offer no detail . So I tried for help from the manufacturer . I tried logging onto iAudio 's web site to get help but without success . I tried to call the iAudio support line . A telephone operator took my name and number and said I 'd get a call back . I did but it was two days later while I was on a flight to Phoenix . I 've written to the tech support address in the hope that someone will answer my plea for help . No response yet . This is my first experience with this technology but I have the following observations . First , transferring files should not be difficult nor should it require proprietary software . Second , memory is memory . These units should accept any standard memory stick or card . This one does not . Third , the manufacturer should provide reliable , easily accessible support . Unfortunately , none of these things seems to be true . At least not yet . I recommend caution here . This product appears to be somewhat unstable and Cowon , the manufacturer , has not impressed me with their support .  
2	  Lemme confess first that I am a complete novice in the line of SLR photography .. but definitely wanted to cross the point and shoot . After a lotta looking around and some suggestions from mah friends , I decided to go for Nikon D40 . And man what a camera , which compelled me to write a review on the first day itself . I can't really give you more technical details , but I can definitely tell you , if you are starting or planning to get into some nice photography , this can be and is one of the best option . The very first day I got the camera delivered , my photos wondered me .. I never knew that I can click photos like those .. all kudos to the the machine .. a 5 star for sure  
1	  If Call Waiting matters to you .. I bought this and used it for a couple of hours before realizing that it did not support Call Waiting AT ALL ( unless you consider hanging up on your current call acceptable ) . The omission of such a commonplace phone system feature should have been stated up front - it was not . The " workaround " suggested by the Plantronics support staff is simply absurd and involves a five step process to " flash " over to the incoming call . As conveyed by the Plantronics support personnel : 1 . Pick up your phone / press Talk on your phoneNote : The step above may require a short sprint if you don't carry your phone around with you . 2 . Hang up the headset ( this is NOT OPTIONAL , see below ) 3 . Flash over to the incoming call using your phone 's Flash / Talk buttonYou are now talking to your new party on your PHONE4 . Click the headset button to turn the headset back on5 . Hang up your phone . You must repeat steps 1 - 5 to return to your original call . The Plantronics web site FAQ states the following : = Can I switch between calls ( " Flash " feature ) using the headset ? If the user is on a call using the headset and receives another incoming all , pressing the headset button will simply hang up the current call but will not transfer to the new incoming call . * Important note : The " Flash " feature is deactivated when the CS55H headset is turned on . In other words , if the user turns the phone back on during an incoming call in order to view incoming Caller ID , pressing the " Flash " button on the handset will not switch to the other call . = That said , the call quality and range of the headset was excellent and if call waiting / switching between calls is not important to you then you 'll probably be very happy with it .  
1	  Same as the others . My guarrantee expired on january 12 , after 1 year of purchasing , and bingo .. by february 8 I kept on having blue screens and constant shut downs . They told me it was a motherboard problem , and That I needed to buy a new one . No way I am spending that money and giving it to them again . I rather get a new pc from another company . Tech support was pretty attentive I 'd say , but half the time they knew what they were talking about . I am bringing my complaint , together with this webpage , as a proof , to the BB .  
1	  Based on reviews , I purchased this FM transmitter to be used with my Garmin 760 GPS ( note - the GPS has a built-in FM transmitter , but it 's way too weak ) since I had loaded my music collection on an SD card that I have in the Garmin . It worked great for the first few weeks . Only real issue was that I have the GPS mounted on the left side of my windshield ( so it doesn't obstruct my view ) and the Coby comes with a coiled cable so it needed to be streatched out a little . Recently , it stopped working and I discovered that it had blown the little fuse inside ( easy to replace ) . I took it to Radio Shack and bought a 4-pack of replacement fuses ( $ 2 ) . Then , over the next 2 weeks , it blew 2 more fuses . At first I thought it was because I had the stereo plug touching something metal but the 2nd time it was just laying on the passenger seat . ( I share the GPS with my wife so it 's not always in my car ) . I now have two options . If I return it to Coby , I have to pay shipping both ways . Amazon has a great exchange policy . However , problem is that they are out of stock and is only for sale by one of their vendors for $ 58 ! So , I guess I 'll just get a refund from Amazon and look for another FM transmitter . One final note - Be careful if your car is the type where the cigarette lighter is always powered ( for example , my wife 's Pontiac ) because there is no on-off switch . In this case , DON'T LEAVE IT PLUGGED IN !  
1	  Ok the thing is is that they really do fit well . BUT ! The sound is reversed , the instromentals ( spelling ? ) are put louder and the vocals are bearly there . and i know that the tape was working so .. don't get it though it 's not very good at all .  
1	  There was no prior info regarding the inability to use the cable when transferring from Vista to Vista . Naturally ' I never would have purchased it if I had kn own .  
2	  I bought one of these along with three MSI PC60G ( Ralink 61 ) . Right now I 'm using it with the tomato firmware , but even the standard one was fine . One of the clients is in a room outside the house ( there are two thick walls and a kitchen between the router and the PC ) , another is directly upstairs ( again , an old , thick floor ) and the third is still waiting for the assembly . The signal is surprisingly good ( even with the linksys firmware , but better with tomato set to 42mW ) , though I had to keep trying channels until I found one that didn't suffer from intermitent noise outside the house ( probably coming from a neighbor using a 2.4GHz telephone ) . The QOS with tomato is great , too . The router keeps cool even here in Rio de Janeiro !  
2	  This has been a great replacement battery . The charge seems to last a good amount of time . Glad I made the purchase .  
2	  This trackball was a gift and I enjoyed it very much , exept that you have to clean it often and the ( rollers ? ) don't last very long . Within a year I had to replace the mouse .  
2	  I purchased this telescope for my 9 yr old daughter as a Christmas / Birthday present . I had no idea what to get but the reviews of this seemed like a good buy . It came in a huge box with directions for set-up that looked darn right scary ! I am not mechanical and the directions are limited - no step by step pictures and some key pieces aren't labeled at all . With that being said I still managed to get it together without incident ! It took me at least 1 1/2 hrs - as I said I 'm mechanically challenged . I did make 1 call to the help desk - the tripod required installation of a piece that wasn't actually listed at all in the diagram - once I found that it made more sense . The telescope is so NEAT - it looks amazing and the view is spectacular . For the money it can't be beat .  
2	  Pros : delivers exactly what it says . Cons : the upload system , which is already a plus , in their webpage [ .. ] to print is extremely impractical because you have to input one disc info at a time . For those of us who already have a list of discs it 'd be great to have an upload function , from an excel file for example .  
1	  I had a C86 for around a year , and got the blank-page problem that everyone else seems to have . Oddly , though , after turning it off for a couple of days , I turned it on and an apparent miracle had occurred . It started working again . Well that bought me several more months , but a few days ago , it went down for the count . The software told its usual lie about nearly empty ink cartridges . Hoping for another " miracle " , I bought a fresh round of ink , and that turned it into a boat anchor : nothing but blank pages , except for the occasional wisp of cyan . Bottom line , this was a really good printer while it lasted , got good reviews back in December ' 04 when I bought it . I 've noticed most of the bad reviews are from 2006 . Lesson learned . Don't buy another Epson . My previous printer was a Canon BJC 4550 that lasted over 6 years , and still worked fairly well when I gave it away . I just bought an HP D4160 .  
1	  This is the first pair of decent headphones I bought , and the first pair that cost more than $ 20 . Let me first say that upgrading from earbuds to these is an eye-opening experience . However , two pairs have broken over the past year . Unfortunately , they offer no warranty of any kind . The first pair started crackling a lot , and eventually it would only work if you held the cable a certain way near the end . Since I liked the quality , I decided to buy another pair in case the first one was just defective . On this pair , the left ear just stopped working suddenly . I take very good care of my things ( especially expensive things ) , and have no idea why two pairs broke . I now have to wait a few days for some Sennheiser HD202s to be shipped to me , since I believe they will be of better sound quality anyway . There are a few other problems as well : The cord is extremely short , which makes it difficult to use when doing anything other than sitting at home listening to music . These headphones have another interesting problem . They don't play very loud , so even with my volume all the way up , I still had to strain to hear certain things . However , these also leak . A lot . So when I 'm riding the L or in an elevator , or anywhere where I 'm not alone , I have to turn down the music . And then I can't hear it very well ( at least not well enough to appreciate the sound quality ) . I also plug this into my amp sometimes , and I have to turn the volume on my guitar and the amp all the way up just to get loud enough to drown out the sound of the strings ( when I 'm playing with distortion ) . I really can't justify this purchase . I guess it introduced me to good sound quality and made me enjoy music much more since I could hear it , but the negatives far outweigh the positives , and I would not recommend these headphones to anyone , especially not for the price .  
1	  These headphones and complete JUNK ! Sound is awful , crackly , NOT clear at all . Don't waste your money . Sending them back immediately !  
1	  Volume control stopped working the morning after we unpacked it . Now it works only on high , with lots of static . I wasn't expecting much sound quality at this price point , but this product is ridiculously shoddy .  
2	  I purchased this after researching on the Internet for two months . This little gem has many very useful characteristics that most players of it 's range of price don't even come close . I even compared to the latest Sony players and they lack many of the features of the D2 . Sincerely , I highly recommend it .  
1	  I paid about $ 50 for this turntable one year ago . The biggest problem with this turntable is that even the slightest floor vibrations cause obnoxious bass thumps that make my speakers bounce like crazy . And don't turn the amp too loud or the vibrations from the speakers cause obnoxious feedback through the turntable . This turntable needs some kind of shocks or suspension to absorb floor vibrations . When the needle hits the record , or is lifted , it also causes loud bass thumps through my speakers that strain the amp / speakers . Another problem with this turntable is that the RCA output cable is literally 1 foot long - I am NOT exaggerating . So if you plan on placing the turntable more than a foot away from your amp , you 'll need to invest in an RCA extension cord and an RCA female-female converter . I won't comment on the audio quality because this is the only turntable I 've ever owned , but it seems mediocre to me . Once again , another chintzy Sony product .. they really make junk these days . =/  
1	  This device is not for digitizing VHS collections onto DVD . The software that comes with it uses digital image and video files that are already on your computer or your digital video camera and makes Windows media files for burning onto video CDs . These are animated slide shows with background music . However it does bring a poor quality video image from an analog device such as a VCR on to your desktop but I haven't found a way to store this information on the computer . The software that comes with it doesn't do this . Probably will need to get third party software but the image quality will be poor .  
1	  My review will continue along the same vien as the rest : JUNK AFTER 90 DAYS ! Warning to potential buyers - there are power problems with this tv - the power light comes on for a nanosecond than fades and the TV does not work after several months . If don't mind losing $ 175 in Vegas , this tv is for you . I would not buy this TV / DVD combo .  
2	  I really cannot rate the product because I will not be using it . It is a gift for my grandson . I 'm sure he will love it .  
2	  My first experience with a Canon scanner was horrible . No response was received from Canon after 2 inquiries about a seemingly defective scanner . ( Thank-god for Amazon customer service ! ) Despite the problems , I rolled the dice on another Canon and am pleased with it . The 660U scans reasonably fast ; the picture quality is nice and the film scanner is a fantastic bonus . Hookup was a snap ( Windows ME didn't even crash ! ) and the scanner has performed flawlessly since . The purchase of any Canon scanner over the web would seem to be a significant risk due to the lack of support from Canon . It is simply a pain to have to keep shipping things regardless of who is footing the bill . If you get one that works , you 'll be happy with this one .  
1	  Unless you run only 32 bit OS or older DO NOT BUY . there is NO 64 bit support for vista or Mac OSX . lynksys tech help simply blames your existing hardware and tries to sell you a pay to repair tech service . DO NOT RECCOMEND to anyone not totally tech savvy as it took three tries to install and much configuration after it did install .  
1	  the shipping was 10 $ more than the cost of the cables ! 2 sets of two different sizes , 20 + $ and the shipping 30 + $ .. not a good deal at all , and I couldn't see the shipping until the credit card info went in . thumbs downnot shopping cables HERE again ! i would rather pay too much upfront in a store !  
2	  This cheap discman plays well and has a lot of features considering the low price . I was looking for a cheap discman for my eight years old daugther . I wanted a discman , which was able to play MP3 files . This one does the job , shows the title and the artist in the display and does it all very well . My daugther listen to it before she goes to sleep , in the car and all day long . Great present ! Only disappointment was the headphones . The wire has got a loose connection , so I had to find some other headphones for her . But my daugther is probably the one to blame ..  
2	  Came neatly packed and shipped promptly . You CAN actually get audio through these adapters if you 're routing a PC-peripheral connection and your PC uses an ATI card or has a SPDIF connection to transmit audio .  
2	  Delivery time was great andf it works well - now I can listen and have the volume up and not dusturb anyone or have the volume on my powered compute speakers .  
2	  This is my second digital camera , the first also an Olympus . With so many features and shooting modes , I did study the manual . I first found that shooting without a flash indoors using the " auto " mode or the " P " ( program ) mode produced fuzzy images , but using the " Scene - Portrait with Available Light " function , indoor shots are clear . I love not having a removable / losable lens cap . The built in lens cover retracts as the camera turns on . The " Scene - Sports " feature produced incredibly sharp action photos at our local rodeo . The macro and super-macro feature is very good . Closeup flower images come out clear even with a little breeze blowing . I like having an optical view finder . The 5x zoom coupled with the seamless 4x digital zoom ( 20x max zoom ) produced a surprisingly sharp closeup . The one thing that isn't good - and it may be so with all digital still cameras - is the movie feature . The resolution is very low and capturing one frame for use as a photo is useless . Seems to me my older digital did a better job of using a movie to capture a child leaping from a dock so that I could select one frame from the movie to print . Perhaps I need more experience . My previous camera used AA batteries , and this one does too , so my stock of rechargeable AA batteries hasn't gone to waste . The size and weight of the camera are good . The camera comes with the Advanced Manual on CD rom , in PDF format . This is a bit of a pain if you want to have the manual with you , but at least you can print it in any size , and omit the parts ( like how to print photos ) you don't need . The manual is fairly easy to understand and navigate . The camera is easy to use ( once you know where everything is ) and I 'm very happy with it . I still have much to learn and will probably like it even more . I gave it a 4-star rating only because of the movie problem . Update : After using the camera for several months I 've noted several problems with it . It badly over-exposes when using the " scene " menu . So far , only the point-and-shoot auto settings have resulted in good photos . Doing comparison shots with my old 2.1mp Camedia 2040 , and a Nikon Coolpix , all three did a good job on automatic settings . When switching to " Scene " mode for the Sport Zoom , either in " sport " or " landscape " mode , the photos were horribly over-exposed in late afternoon lighting . Olympus has a way to fix this , I think , but when you 're in a hurry for a photo , just use the " auto " mode or buy another camera . Instead of 4 stars , I 'd give it a 2 1/2 .  
2	  Got the Rio S30S @ costco for approx $ 79 ; came with an additionl 32 meg SDcard which gave a total of 96 meg of storage . loading the software didn't have the best of directions & honestly was confusing . although i loaded the rio music manager software & for whatever reason loaded up the annoying realplayer software , neither one is needed since windows media player is all you need to manage your music . putting tunes on the S30S is a snap with windows media player . sound quality is quite good ; the included headphones are not comfortable ; i can see getting a replacement pair of headphones very soon . the fm tuner , as other reviewers have noted , is extremely weak . i got the player for workouts @ the gym ; for this purpose , it works quite well . overall this is a good value ; given the ease of putting tunes on here , at this point , i see no reason to spend more $ by upgrading memory further .  
2	  It has been great using this remote control with my Ipod . Now I can drive and change music with one touch botton . Also in a party is very usufull to carry on the remote with you and change of song from long distance . Hope you like it like me .  
2	  I have this computer down at school , and it has been a very good investment . At its small price , you really cant ask for a better deal . Its battery is amazing , and the performance is second to none .  
2	  My first impression of the Panasonic DMC-FZ8K was it is a small camera . After playing around with some of the features I was impressed with this camera . The FZ-8K takes fantastic pictures that are truly very sharp . What I 'm most surprised with is the feature for close ups or macro . I was taking pictures of coins that were as good as my Canon D20 . So small but packed with so many features that blows your mind . I have taken this camera FZ8K outside and ran some test of my own to see what I could do with it . I took some pictures of some Finches that feed at one of my bird feeders . Took many pictures of some buildings and even went to the Zoo . Every picture came out perfect the bird pictures were so good that I had one made into a 5x7 and framed it . I have never used a Panasonic camera and I would have to say I 'm impressed . I was so Impressed with the FZ8Kthat I also purchased a Panasonice DMC-L1 . The image stabalizer works great it 's not perfect but it will get the job done . I took a picture of the moon with out the use of a tripod came out nice . To sum this up if your in the market for a great camera that is easy to use and with more features for more advanced users look no farther . This can be a simple point and shoot or you are able to change many features to be more creative . I was never a fan of point and shoot cameras but when I sawthis camera on Amazon and did my home work . I read many reviews on the internet and made up my mind to give it a chance . I figured if I didn't like it I would sent it back to Amazon . After about an hour of playing with the camera the day it arrived . I new that this was a keeper in my book . It is small and I have big hands but fits me just fine . All controls for the FZ8K are easy to work when holding the camera . I bought a four gb memory card for it and a card reader . I no that this will never take the place of DSLR but the cost is a fraction and the results are and will amaze you what this little FZ8K can do . One thing maybe I can pass on is no matter what camera you are interested in read some reviews . I have never read a review on any camera that they have not found something wrong with it in some way . What I 'm saying is there is no perfect camera out there . But I will say the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8K is as close to perfect as I will ever find . You have to handle the camera fill all the controls the make your own mind up . For me one that has a couple DSLR I 'm very happy with my little Panasonic FZ8K . Also Amazon also had the best price on the net . And they shipped it lighting fast . I have used a Fugi point and shoot and a couple Canon point and shoot . My brother owns a Sony camera and loves it till he saw what the FZ8K can do and do it better . My pictures come out sharper more vivid and my zoom is a so much better . The Sony my brother uses cost 245.00 and is a little smaller andhe is able to put in a shirt pocket . Mine I can't but feature for feature mine blows his away . I 'm very happy with the performance and features that are on this Panasonic . Give this camera a chance and it to will make you as happy as it has made me . A fantastic camera for not allot of money . Gizmo  
2	  The case is great . It is a perfect fit for the Ipod Nano . The leather is good quality and it looks a lot more expensive than the affordable price on Amazon . The shipping was prompt and I am very satisfied with the product . I would order from this seller again .  
1	  After a few uses , I got CF Card Error during a function at home with my Canon G3 . Going to try if I can get a replacement . Even with that , I don't think I will be using this for any important events . When I buy a card next time , I have to read each and every review and see how many people with G3 got into trouble .  
2	  This is a well designed surge protector . A useful product feature that isn't listed in the details is that 2 of the outlets are unswitched , so you can turn the power off but still have those two outlets with power which is great for saving electricity . So far I haven't had any surges to test it - but hopefully that won't be necessary !  
1	  I was actually looking for a remote control for viewing photos on my TV like my old Olympus had . When I got it I realized it was only to use when taking photos that included myself . Handy , so I will keep it , but it was about $ 25 and it only has one function and that is to trigger the shutter . I was looking for a way to sit a distance away from the camera and TV and view a photo show via remote control .  
2	  I basically like the product , however I am having a lot of issues importing videos that I have not been able to resolve .  
1	  Purchased this camera for my husband 's dive business so he could instantly photograph his students who successfully completed their scuba course . That was in November . A friend did some research and found that the film is being discontinued this year ( 2009 ) . I should have paid attention to the other reviewers who mentioned this . Why sell a camera that you can no longer buy film for ? ! It came from Adobe Camera and when I called them to get a RMA # , they asked why I was returning it . When I told them - no response - but I did get my money back for the camera and the extra film I purchased . Seems ridiculous to me for Amazon to be selling a product that will soon be totally useless , unless of course , you have lots of $ to stock up on film ( it ' expensive - turns out to be about $ 1 a picture - don't make a mistake ! )  
1	  For a cheap product my expectations were low but not nearly low enough . These headphones were unusable . The headset is so narrow it felt like they were pinching my head and caused the cuffs to put way too much , pressure on my ears . I am a very small woman so it isn't as if I have an enormous noggin . My ears hurt the whole time I was wearing these and after only an hour my ears were hurting so much I had to take the headset off . Also , the braided cable touching my shirt created a lot of noise in the headset .  
1	  This is a terrible product - Apple should be ashamed of itself for allowing anything as cheesy as this part to remain in production . I 've been through two of these adapters . As many reviewers have previously mentioned , my first adapter broke because of the inexcusably thin wire and flimsy connector that plugs into the laptop . The second Apple adapter I purchased just internally combusted , made a popping sound and quit working one day after three months of casual use . This product is so poor that it puts the entire Apple laptop product line in a poor light . Even though I am a big fan of OS X , I would have to think long and hard before buying more apple hardware .  
1	  i have a garmin quest fitted to my bike but recently had the chance to use a tomtom rider for a few days . they do not compare . considering the rider is twice the price , it is no more glove friendly than the quest , and the bluetooth feature is a complete pain . why no simple headphone socket ? the directions were difficult to hear on the motorway , full volume is only about a quarter that of the garmin . with helmet speakers ( of your choice ) the quest gives simple to hear directions , in stereo . the quest comes with full european mapping , for no extra . i will not be rushing to buy one and do not reccommend it as particularly " motorcycle friendly " , obviously no bikers were involved in the development !  
2	  Verbatim CD-R 80MIN 700MB 52X LightScribe ( 30pk Spindle Box ) No problems with use . All disks came out fine . Did not have to toss any away . We love the lightscribe where you can put pictures and such . It burns great ! Would recommend this product .  
2	  So you want to know how a Visor differs from a Palm ? The short answer is not too much , but enough to make the Visor Deluxe a better purchase than the Palm IIxe ( 3Com 's competing unit ) . The major differentiators are the following : 1 ) The Visor 's form factor is a touch more ergonomic , I feel . 2 ) The Visor comes preloaded ( in ROM ) with a niftier address book application . 3 ) The Visor 's OS ( although the same as the current Palm , I believe ) is non-upgradable . 4 ) The Visor comes equiped with the " Springboard " expansion slot which allows for the addition of everything from modems to GPS units to MP3 players with little to no change in form factor ( the Palm , on the other hand , generally expands via larger units that snap on the back and connect to the cradle contact ) . I 've been incredibly satisfied with the performance and durability of my Visor having upgraded from an old Palm Personal . Either way you go , these handhelds are potentially the most useful thing you can spend $ on .  
2	  I purchased this for my T43 IBM ThinkPad . It fit nicely . The screen holders look slightly flimsy , but I don't take the screen off . I leave it on even when I shut down . I find it very nice for travelling . I don't have to worry about someone 2ft away from me viewing my desktop . Although it does not completely shut out prying eyes , it does limit . Your neighbors will be able see what you are viewing , but not very clearly . I was hesitant about the purchase but now that I have it , I find that I am less reluctant to work when someone is next to me .  
2	  This was relativel easy purchase to make .. the seller described the adapter ring well .. sometimes it is difficult to determine the correct size and how the threads are situated but this seller did a good job describing the product .. worked perfectly ..  
2	  The SD700 is an amazing little camera . I carry it in my pocket to augment a very expensive digital SLR from the same manufacturer . Terrific , clear images , easy to use , always ready to get the shot that I missed with the big camera . I have some great bird and family photos to credit to this powerhouse camera . These opportunities were available at times when I only had the SD700 in my pocket . This little giant is no toy , but a working friend to carry .  
1	  The title says it all . I had most of the problems others had except that I didn't have the problem with the batteries not fitting . My main objection is that this mouse eats batteries . I 'm replacing them about every 2 weeks , sometimes more . The reason I have to do this seems to be that the light doesn't turn off when the mouse is idle so it burns the batteries up . Otherwise it 's ok . I keep in a drawer just in case something happens to one of the other mice . Just some advice - don't let it get too far from the mini-receiver and if it stops working check to see if the mini-receiver has been hit and lost contact with the computer - the way it sticks out makes that easy to happen . Mine did not have the battery not fitting problem but because of how cheaply made these items are it was more luck than design .  
2	  The part works like it should . I am glad it was not a counterfeit . I am seeing more of these lately .  
1	  I am reviewing this Interfit 411 tramsmitter in the context of the price point ( around $ 35.00 ) . I was looking for an inexpensive solution to trigger two Interfit EXD 400 's without cables in a small home studio environment . After testing this product on numerous occassions , I am unsure of its value even at the low price point . Build quality : build quality is ok . Clearly not assembled or contructed with high grade materials . However , with proper handling I would expect it to last a while ( once again , considering price point ) . However , if you drop this item onto a hard floor , chances are it will shatter or at least stop working . Admittedly a bit of speculation on my part . Hot Shoe Fit : no problem mounting this item on a Nikon D300s hot shoe . Seems to be a good fit with no " wiggle . " Triggering : here is where the problems start . First off , this device does in fact trigger my EXD-400 Interfit monolights with the built in optical slave .. under ideal conditions . However , I equate its practical application as needing line of sight to all optical slaves of the monolights you wish to trigger . In other words , your positioning as a photographer to the subject is severely limited when needing to trigger the strobes . Essentially , in my two strobe setup , I need to be between and behind both lights . So , if one light is further back than the other , I must stay behind the light back the furthest . Comparatively , when using my D300s flash , I can be positioned nearly anywhere and that is with the Nikon IR flash panel ( SG-31R ) mounted . Outdoor use trials were problematic in that the transmitter only triggered the mono lights about 60 % of the time ( overcast ) . Battery use : I have not used the item long enough to provide a good opinion as to use . While I may consider another week or so trial before I decide whether to return the transmitter , I will most likely look for a wireless trigger in the comparable price range . For example , Gadget Infinity just released their new Cactus V4 wireless triggers ( 2.4ghz freq . ) . Clearly these triggers cannot compete with the venerable Pocket Wizards . However , at about $ 65.00 for a two monolight setup , it 's not far off from the INT411 . Plus the V4 's received very good reviews from semi pro 's and even some pro 's . Reported working distances in open field settings exceed 100 yards and more . Either way , IR transmission , regardless of price point , may not be the most reliable means of triggering . * UPDATE * Additional testing compels me to return this item . The range drops to 10 feet ( at best ) outside with everything perfectly lined up . Essentially , the INT 411 is only acceptable for use indoors and in a very coordinated manner in which the photographer remains stationary ( more or less ) . I decided to go with a " poverty wizard . " Specifically , after a great deal of research , I just ordered a set of Yongnuo triggers 2.4GHz ( RF-602 ) . Users are reporting range over 100 meters and through walls and trees .  
1	  I have ordered two of these and the suction part breaks after each use ! What a rip off . Ordering now straight from Garmin .  
1	  This cord did not work . The audio was a loud screeching sound . Had to buy the pricier version from a local store .  
1	  This camera should sell for $ 29.95 at Toy 's R-US . The picture quality even under good lighting conditions and setup to " fine " is terrible . Worse if you use the digital zoom , then the images become unbearably pixelated . Any cell phone camera can take better pictures . No flash , no way to change the date , no shutter or apperture priority , and no programs . You cannot charge the camera unless you connect it to your PC or Laptop , so it 's not even practical for traveling . The menu is limited and hard to use and the manual is a disgrace . In addition , it has poor workmanship and is made of cheap plastic , the cord is made of the cheapest leather and has an ugly brown color . Mine didn't even come in the nice wooden box ! It is not worthy of the Leica name . Don't buy it !  
1	  i bought this router and a netgear wireless PCMCIA card . could not get the router to work properly with my motorola surfboard cable modem . spent 2 days on phone with netgear tech support ( in india , difficult to understand them ) gave up . bought linksys . plugged it in and it worked . no configuration . linksys interface is slightly better . still no idea on why the netgear router gave me so much trouble . bottom line : linksys-up and running as soon as i plugged it innetgear-2 days and i gave up , tech support no help  
1	  I got these headphones and thought they were great . They sounded like it was a minature subwoofer with crisp sound quality . I was happy with it and bragged about how great they were .. until a month passed .. After a month the right side of the ear buds completely died on me . Someone suggested to me that it might be ear wax - . - " and after poking it with a pin it was perfectly clean . The " solution " didnt work at all and once again i was left in a stump . My one month warranty expired and it didn't make sense how they just stopped working when i just use it on daily basis for listening purposes with my mp3 . Now i am left with my default headphones that came with my iriver and it really disappoints me that after going through many reviews i still ended up with a much disappointed headphone ..  
2	  I am currently in the process of remodeling my new condo . Before I moved I sold my whole home theater . This time around I planned on wall mounting everything . I was looking for speakers that looked nice , sounded great and came from a brand I could trust . I couldn't have been more pleased . First , I was impressed by the packaging . The system came double boxed and undamaged . Second , the size was perfect . I went from big black Infinity towers to this much more asthetically pleasing setup . everything was a breeze to mount and looked great with my new Panisonic plasma . I paired this system up with a new Onkyo 605 receiver . I auto calibrated everything and then made some adjustments to my liking . I own both a Blu Ray and a HD DVD player and the new audio formats sound great . I always had an issue with vocals on my old system , but now everything is crisp and clear . Which reminds me . Crisp is the perfect word to describe the highs of this system . I knew I wasn't going to get any earth shaking base out of this set up , but was pleased to realize that the low end performed much better than I thought it would . In the end this system works great for a space that is around 18 x 15 sq / ft . Together with my receiver I spend about $ 700 and ended up with a setup that sounds much more expensive . You won't be disappointed !  
1	  Had these earphones for a little over 1 year . Sounded fine and held up under exercise usage . Wire covering has now split exposing the wire in 5 different parts of the wire and is now unusable . I did not cause the damage . Might not have bought them if I knew this could occur .  
2	  I loved this 3M flat panel mounted copy holder so much that after I received the first one for my office computer , I ordered another one for my home computer . I would have given it a 5-star , but the lower score was because I thought it was a bit overpriced . However , it was very easy to put together , and it really helps me see the documents I 'm typing on my computer , otherwise I would need to buy tri-focal eyeglasses to see at the necessary typing distance . I like how it swings back out of the way when not in use . I did have to tighten the nut to prevent the stand from swinging backwards while typing .  
2	  This was a Father 's day gift . This radio works great right out of the box . It was easy to install in my 2006 Toyota Van and looks great just sitting in there . The weather channel is an excellent extra feature for South Louisiana where we sometimes get Hurricanes during the Summer . The squelch is sensitive and works good . The RF gain really does what it is supposed to do . The only problem was adjusting the SWR on the Lil Wilson Antenna I purchased with this radio . Once the SWR was properly set his baby could and does really talk out . The front firing speaker is nice and clear and easily heard . I like the fact the speaker faces the front and not down into the carpet . After much tinkering I was able to adjust the SWR down to about 1:1 to 1:2 on the most popular channels . The other channels are higher but not enough to damage the radio . This is the first time I used a Wilson brand antenna . I don't know if I would purchase another Wilson although a lot of people like them . I would definitely recommend this radio for general everyday CB use in any car . A good antenna set with the correct SWR makes all the difference in the world .  
1	  Item arrived , did not fit the car wiring . Tried to send it back but have to pay certified mail which cost more than the item . Did not bother to send back . Vendor should have provide a return labelThis is real customer service .  
1	  I had this television for just over a year when the picture failed . The sound was fine , the channels changed , but there was no picture . ( After some research , I discovered that many people have had the same problem with Toshibas . ) The warranty period had just elapsed so I contacted Toshiba customer service to see what could be done . Not only were they rude and insulting but they indicated that failure of the television happened and said that that was just something that should be accepted with Toshibas . They suggested that I should have gotten an extended warranty . Repair of the television is approximately $ 600 . The television cost just over $ 800 new . Due to this experience , I can confidently say I will not be purchasing a new Toshiba again . Samsung and Sony definitely make a better , more reliable product , plus their customer service is much more professional , helpful , and courteous .  
1	  This system came out during Windows XP , does not work on higher Operating Systems , i , e . Windows 7 + . Have to maintain a XP box , to use . When there are any problems , since Konica / Minolta went BUST , there is no one to ask for help !  
2	  I have a 2006 Ford F150 with one POLK AUDIO ( 5 ) channel amp and one POLK AUDIO mono sub amp . These cables ( purchased here on Amazon ) were a necessity and I am extremely impressed with Monster Cables MPC I3 line of interconnects . They are a perfect fit for my amps and the sound quality is second to none ! I HIGHLY recommend these cables . I have 0 gauge wire running throughout my 1800 watt system and I have NO audible noise , what-so-ever ! Thank you Monster Cable for a really good cable ! I would buy these again !  
1	  I bought this mouse because every laptop mouse I have had seems to last only about 6 months and this one has great reviews . So far , after two weeks , the mouse is working fine but I cannot use it in a conference or meeting because the scroll wheel is so noisy that it would draw attention . I have never heard such a noisy wheel . I was also very disappointed that the people at Logitech have absolutely no concern for the environment . The excessive amount of heavy duty plastic packaging seems more appropriate for the crown jewels than a cheap mouse . I needed a heavy duty knife to cut through the sealed plastic and then the sharp plastic edge cut my finger . In short , I would not buy this mouse again .  
2	  Simply amazing is all i can say about these headphones . I think they are the best headphones for 100 or less . I have tried senns , sonys , skullcandys and numerous other brands and none sound as good as the porta pro 's . the headphones really sound great , excellent actually . it is hard to beat these headphones , throw in the lifetime no questions ask warranty and it really is a no brainer . the only flaw i see is that it can at times pull your hair when taking them on / off .  
1	  loose and jiggly , wouldn't maintain a connection to the power port and the triple socket things came loose . RETURNED FOR REFUND . But it is a Bell and they usually have quality stuff so it might have just been the luck of the draw .  
2	  I bought this to upgrade the sound on a old gateway laptop . I had some problems at 1st . I tried to use the drivers on the CD . That came with the usb sound card . It would not work . Keep getting error messages and it wouldn't completely install the drivers . I downloaded the drivers from the Turtle Beach website . They install in like 10 sec . After enabling the s / pdif output I was in business . Used a toslink cable to my receiver . I 've never heard sound this good from my old laptop or old receiver . The laptop is 5 years old and the receiver is 10 years old . I get better surround sound from movies on my laptop . Than I do on my 3 year old DVD player . Which is also hook up s / pdif . My receiver is so old . It only has dolby surround sound . But with this little sound card . It sounds almost like true 5.1 DTS surround . Best $ 29 buck upgrade I 've ever done to a pc .  
2	  Gave it 5 stars based on it 's likelihood to " save " my attached equipment . Given a power surge too great for it 's rating , it goes into " martyrdom-mode " destroying itself , effectively disconnecting the attached equipment . Bought it at [ .. ] through Amazon at half the price of others including [ .. ] .  
1	  I bought this card for my Samsung T809 and it did not work . I called Samsung and Kingston and both told me that the other needed to " create a software update on their products " . So now I use it for my Casio camera . It 's a little slow at loading ( I think it 's because I have to use the included SD adapter ) but it 's okay . I suggest SanDisk and Dana-Elec brands , which I 've had good experiences with .  
1	  This product does not have a driver for Windows XP , which makes it a very [ costly ] paperweight . Customer support said to use the Windows 2000 driver and it would work , but they were wrong . When they get a working driver for XP I think this product may be worth something .  
1	  When I bought this webcam , I first thought that it can act just like a digital camera , but right now I know that I was mistaken . If you 're just looking for a way to share your pictures and videos with friends and family this is a good choice , because its very cheap , easy to use and has good Internet capabilities . But if the quality of pix and videos and size of them matters to you I really don't recommend it to you . The biggest picture that you can take by it is 320x240 .  
2	  I didn't expect this thing to live up to the hype . I thought paying this much for a remote was ridiculous . I thought it would be cumbersome .. Let me tell you . It * IS * worth all the hype . You know how you get a universal remote and it just doesn't do EVERYTHING that the original remote does ? It doesn't have all the proper keys , or the keys it does have don't preform the action you want it to .. Or your wife still prefers the cable box remote to the so called " universal " remote and eschews it for that one . So you end up with a caddy full of remotes even with the universal . This ? This is the END to all of that . I have no other remote now but this one . They all live in a basket in a bin in my entertainment console . Let me tell you why . You can program ANY remote into this . The web interface has every brand of equipment I have , and then some . You simply tell the interface what you have , and how you use it . You can build activities that you then tell it " Ok , this is on channel 2 and the stereo is on cable and the .. ( blah blah blah ) " so that you push ONE button to watch tv . And one button to watch a DVD . So : PlusesEasy to set up web interfaceWIDE amount of different drivers for all kinds of equipment . Ability to learn remotes it doesn't already have . CompactUses rechargeable batteries , and has it 's own charging stand . Fairly intuitive controls . Great on board help system . Minuses : Keys on the remote are a bit small and close together . Charging contacts corrode . ( This is a common problem for me with logitech devices . ) If you get the chance , pick one up . All of my friends are terribly jealous of mine now , and want one of their own . With the availability of the Harmony One and other Harmony remotes the prices on these have dropped dramatically , so why even hesitate ?  
2	  I bought the Creative ZEN 60GB two years ago . I did a lot of research before making my choice . Back then , it offered the most for the price compared to other similar players on the market . I bought it on Dell . ca for 350 $ with free shipping . I can only give it 3.5 now because there are other products out that offer a similar or better package for about the same price . Pros : - Wide glossy screen - Various options such as address book , equalizer , random play , FM radio .. - Easy to set up and navigate through . - The software is not necessary to transfer content . - Software is easy to use and understand . - Large storage space . - Reads and plays different file types . - Great for long car rides or waiting periods . Watching movies makes time go faster when waiting at the hospital . - AC adapter as well as USB available to charge the player . - Reads many types of memory cards . ( this is great for example when you are on vacation and you want to dump all of your pictures from your card onto it ) . - Fast file transfer ( except for some exceptions when using the software ) Cons : - Player freezes once in a while and have to reset it by removing the battery . Then have to wait for it to build the library again . - Battery life could be better - Battery symbol is always full until low battery message shows up and the player dies . Basically , you never know at what level the battery is . - No Blue Tooth or other wireless option integrated . - Accessories are hard to find and are expensive . - The integrated speaker is useless for music and movies . - No embedded games or options to download games . - weight - bulky ( especially at the gym ) I am pretty much satisfied with my player in general . I would have probably been a bit more disappointed if I had bought it for more than 400 $ .  
1	  On the plus side : The sound quality is satisfactory for the price provided the buds are actually in the ear canal . On the down side : The biggest problem is they do not remain snug in my ear canal . Instead I have to push them into the ear canal where the sound can be best heard . But as soon as I start any kind of movement , household chores , work outside , or exercise , the buds fall out of the ear canal . So you can either push them back every few seconds or turn the volume on your player up - which will give you tinny high frequency sound only . They may work if you have a larger ear canal , the size of say the Chunnel or the Big Dig . The ear loops are of lightweight plastic and not adjustable at all . So there is no way to achieve a snug fit whereby the buds remain in place . There is no sound isolation whatsoever so they are no good for a plane or any environment with ambient noise . I 've revised this review so I can add that I have found them to be unusable for any task except listening while sitting totally still .  
2	  Um1 's are good , but the dual driver um2 's have the perfect amount of " uumph " I need for performing . Clarity is great , and I see they have a new gel tips . Mine are a few years old with the foam tips . They get oily and wear out , but overall , these are the best for the price . Only way someone wouldn't like these are if the universal fit doesn't fit their unique ears  
1	  Threw away my money AGAIN . Was thrilled to find a new battery for my favorite SONY camera , only to find I was sent a unchargable T1 chargable battery .  
1	  I purchased this product as a low-cost stocking stuffer for my wife . After reading two professional reviews on the product from other sites , I decided to give it a shot . Initial advertises this product as both a portable and a stand-alone unit . My thought was to use it as both . Midway through watching my second disk in stand-alone mode , the unit started vibrating loudly , the picture froze , and then stopped playing altogether . Thinking it might be a bad unit , I returned the product and took home a replacement . Well , this time , I was about 1 hour into my first movie when the unit again began vibrating , freezing up , etc . In portable mode , the unit played OK . The picture was not that sharp , but sound was fine . The unit did however get very hot after only a short period of operation . Please stay away from this product . I have since taken it back and will stick to quality products ; i.e Panasonic .  
2	  Excellent customer service . Had a problem with one of the creative web cams . Returning the item was very easy especially printing the return instructions and the return label from the account .  
1	  I ordered the microphone system to use in a wedding and it arrived just in time . ( within projected time of arrival ) . The box was opened and within a few minutes the system was up and operating , for about 5 minutes . While it worked great , after a few minutes I couldn't hear the transmissions from the earphone . I had to purchase a Sima ( not as well designed ) unit from Best Buy to use in the wedding . I contacted Amazon and was able to return the unit hassle free .  
1	  The cord was relatively easy to set up and it had screws which made me feel safe about the connection , but it was tried on two different computers and both times left a scrolling image on the TV .  
1	  Suction cup ripped in less than 24 hours . Should have bought the original one . Don't waste your time and money . Don't buy it .  
2	  I ordered my ReplayTV a few days before my parent 's Christmas visit with me . It turned out to be a great entertainment product during the holiday period and it continues to do that now . Yes , there are the occasional glitches but you have to look at this product from a software standpoint as opposed to a typical mechanical gadget . I 've already submitted my wishlist for future improvements . That 's the great thing about the product - it 's going be get a whole new update via software download in the first Quarter of 2000 . If you check ReplayTV . com you 'll see press releases on the new features coming , ( like slo-mo in both directions ! ) . All for free ! Okay , so there 's a Tivo unit for the same price and ' 30 ' hours . But I 'm sure that their ' 30 ' hour recording time produces a really crude image . And you still have to pay for their schedules ! I 'm sticking with ReplayTV . It looks like they 're going to go global soon - they 've already registered international domain names . Hope this helps ..  
1	  We bought this unit for a Directv DVR . It took a lot of tweeking to get it to work in the first place . And now a few months later , still plugged in to the same spot we had it , it stopped working . If you plug the unit in side by side with the base unit it works . If you move it 8 feet , it doesn't work . It has actually been a pain . I feel it 's been a huge waste of time and money .  
1	  i 've had my ziotek for 3 years now when i still had my widows xp . i was able to use this for a few months then our system broke down . we bought a new pc and widows 7 was already out a couple of years now and i never had a chance using this since the driver won't work on widows 7 . i just checked cyberguys . com where i bought it originally and it says it should work on widows 7 since they already fixed it and downloaded the zip file and uploaded it in my computer . Guess what ? still doesn't work and it 's still giving me a ridiculous error message . i regret spending 100 + on this device . don't waste your money on this !  
1	  Don't buy it , if doesn't have a 2,3 mhz processor or an Intel dual core , don't bother .. Also needs a better graphics card , the nvidia geforce 6150 Go can't work with windows vista , also the hardrive must have a 7200 RPM to work properly . Don't buy it .  
1	  This replacement battery does not fit into the phone 's battery compartment as well as the original - it 's smaller and doesn't sit securely . The item arrived with no power and it took at least a week to charge up in the phone caddy . Shipping from Amazon was slow , however the ( expensive ) express shipping option was not selected . After about a month the phone finally seems to be back in proper working order . Too soon to tell about battery life .  
2	  I bought my multipass c755 just this afternoon and have begun to really love it . Setting it up was like a breeze . It prints considerably noiselessly and fast . It faxes , copies and scans great . The best thing about this item is that it 's worth your money . ( That is why I have to give it a five-star instead of a four ) . I did quite some compare shopping before I decided on this one . Other brand names within the same price range simply don't provide as many functions or comparable printing effect .  
1	  Seriously , this was a wonderful tv but it didn't last . After 2 years one of the fluorescent backlights has a flickering problem . Sony has basically said that I will have to pay almost half of my original purchase . There has been a grand drop in quality over at Sony . Pretty much every piece of electronics I have purchased from then in the last 3 years had been poorly designed and overly expensive . I used to justify it because my previous Sony purchases lasted forever . This is just not true anymore . I have been a loyal Sony customer for the past decade . No more .  
1	  I would rate Frontier Labs with a big zero if it were an option , otherwise they get a 1 . The MP3 player we bought was a piece of junk . Crashed repeatedly and locked up regularly . Customer service was terrible and no help whatsoever . We ended up with a pricey paper weight ; and would never buy anything from Frontier Labs again ! Make sure you shop around before buying .  
2	  These work well . For the amount I paid for them ( $ 5 ) I would definitely recommend them .  
2	  Very handy camera bag . Made by Canon . Several handy accessories and compartments . I definitely recommend this bag .  
2	  I bought this card for my mothers new Kodak camera and it worked great , lots of storage space . No Problems  
1	  This fan is good for a cheap price . I got it and it is flimsy . It . 020 thk aluminum and it bows in the middle when you put your laptop .  
1	  I bought this model from Circuit City which offered a free 30-pack of Memorex 80 minute CDRs . Along with a $ 50 rebate I was excited about being able to record tapes , records , and copies of my favorite CDs . Well , after having problems like not finalizing CDRs automatically and just stopping in the middle of a song frozen with no option but to turn the unit off and then on again to get any functions to work ( not to mention rendering alot of CDRs useless and a waste of my time ) , I took it into Circuit City after having it for just over a month . Since Circuit City 's policy is no refunds after that , I took it in to be repaired at one of their service centers . They had it for almost 3 weeks and replaced the CBA recorder in it . Not too long after I got it back the same occured and I brought it back again and after the same amount of time , another CBA recorder had been replaced . The problems continued . I finally called Philips customer support to discover that 80 minute CDRs are not compatible with this model . Now why would Circuit City give free 80 minute CDRs with a model that 's incompatible ? They say they didn't know and eventually gave me 30 TDK 74 minute CDRs after I contacted the company online . Also , why doesn't Philips tell you this in the manual ? How is one to know ? Actually , it does make very good recordings when it 's working right ( the only reason I give it a generous 2 out of 5 ) . However , it still freezes up during a song once in a while , even with 74 minute CDRs and you have to shut it off and on just to get the wells open . Forget about your recorded CDR at that point , it 's useless and a waste of time and money . Like some others who have said negative things about the customer support , I pretty much got the same kind of useless advice . This model has problems , and I think Philips has a tough time with damage control issues . If you buy this model , expect the real possibility of having to deal with these problems . As for me , if the problems continue to persist regularly , I 'll be looking into another brand , but this time I 'll research better . The amount of frustration , waste of time , and money on wasted CDRs just isn't worth it . Although I 'm surprised how many reviewers actually liked it , isn't it amazing how many also had similar problems ?  
1	  We ordered this radio to have on hand in case of emergency . After an hour of cranking to start the power , the crank came off . Got it back on , cranked more , came off again . Small heartattack later from all the fruitless cranking , we sent it back the next day . Looking for another option for an emergency radio , haven't found one yet .  
1	  Dear Sirs , Probably the most dissatisfied with an order that I have ever been . I paid for next day shipping , the item arrived 2 days short of a week later . The outer USPS container was in Excellent Condition . The two inner boxes were preopened , crushed , contained no instructions or hardware , and one of the units was bent and twisted sideways . I probably will not ever attempt to use these or even see if they work as they obviously have been mishandled . In the nearly a week time that I spent waiting for this " next day " delivery , I found better professionally packaged , units at a more reasonable price . First time , " LAST TIME " customer  
2	  I have an external hard drive ( FW400 / USB ) that I 've been using with my new iMac ( FW800 / USB ) . When connected via USB , there were problems with the hard drive and computer not communicating at certain times . This has been a pain , so I was told that using firewire would solve this issue by a Mac Genius . Needing to go from FW400 to FW800 , I purchased this cable and the problem is solved . Best of all , the cable cost only about $ 10 , cheaper than an adaptor .  
2	  This thing works really well - however , you have to plug in two USB plugs ( they do come with it ) if you plan on charging an iPod on it . Otherwise the iPod looses battery faster than it can charge it .  
2	  Good lens . But if you have Canon SLR , buy the canon lens ( Canon EF 28-105mm f / 3.5-4.5 II USM ) . There is a difference between the two while used with Canon SLR . Images are sharper with Canon lens , in my opinion . For other SLR camera , I don't see such difference .  
1	  The small footprint and only needing to plug one thing in attracted me at first . I read good reviews and bad ones here and thought the bad ones are just the unlucky few who got defected units . So I bought one thinking I 'll try my luck . Turns out my unit has the exact same problem . Wireless drops when downloading files or streaming videos ( anything with high bandwidth ) . I can watch an online video for 8 to 10 sec before the whole unit freezes and I need to reset ( turn it off / on ) . There is nothing wrong with the connection because everything is fine if I do the samething with a wired cable . Called Linksys 3x and after they told me to reset , change channal # , etc .. still having dropped wireless connection . The last Linksys tech says it needs a firmware upgrade but Linksys does not have it and the firmware has to be pushed by ISP ( Comcast ) . Called Comcast who said they don't support router problems and they have no firmware available at all . This is apparently common according to Linksys 's online support FAQ . So , stay away .. don't say we didn't warn you .  
1	  this was a joke even for a non geek like me . a waste of money  
1	  I 've owned this TV since 10/2005 , and it worked great until about a month ago . Now the greenish tint that others complain about has arrived . I do have an extended warrenty , and Sony did send a repairman to check my set . Yes , the light engine is out of whack . The service guy said it is covered by warrenty , but he isn't sure if Sony will replace the light engine or provide another set . We 'll see what happens next . 3/7/08 Sony says it will repair my set with a new light engine . Is that engine going to be more dependable than the original one that has failed on so many sets ? The local TV service person says the new light engine has been fixed . Sony discovered the cause of the problem and fixed it . I hope so . This TV offers a great picture-when it 's not tinted green . We 'll see what happens next . 3/11/08 My set has been repaired and it works great now . No charge for the repair . Local TV repair service did a did good job and returned my set quickly . Will the new light engine hold up better than the original ? We 'll see what happens next .  
1	  This wireless router ( if you are going to use it as your main wireless router ) is great . The signal is strong , and it isn't a huge chunk out of your wallet to buy . But if you are looking for a device that is going to be able to bridge a connection and function as a wireless router you are looking in the wrong place . I didn't find this out until after I purchased it . So here I am to warn the rest of you . BEWARE .. you can not use this router as a bridging device . But if you are going to use it for a main wireless router you are fine . But I give it two stars for not listing its inability to do so .. since the model DOWN from this one can .. and the model above this one can .. but oddly enough this specific model is unable to . 2 is what you get .. and be happy I 'm not giving it a 1 .  
2	  Great cable . Available in different colors . Fast shipping and sturdy easy to use boxes . True cat6 that is easy to punch down and terminate . I dont have any cool scientific facts on transfer rates , but I 'm sure it will do fine for all non-NASA-spec things .  
1	  Same as everyone .. pain in the butt to install . It managed to disable my wireless rather connecting it .. The tech support guy , clearly reading a computer screen somewhere in India , was clueless , a jerk on top of it , and rude .. Finally after getting it connected , it now drops the connection repeatedly just as advertised in the other reviews .. I should have listened ..  
1	  this is a nice case but no way at all for a woman to carry it ! I don't wear a belt and how about a handle ? I bought it but will return it very disappointing  
1	  The ad blurb stated 75ft thru walls and floors but the lit in the package made it clear that this was for line of site use . You 're better off buying an extension for your antenna .  
2	  Easy to install . Great deal for the price . Well made and sturdy .  
1	  System developed a " popping " & " crackling " sound and would shut itself down . Tried changing cables , cleaning inside reciever , this did not help . Would work for maybe 10 mins and POP & Crack and shut itself down . Paid almost $ 1000.00 for something I can not use . Onkyo will not return emails . Extremely bad Customer Service !  
2	  I have used several Garmin GPS units in the past and was really undecided over the Quest II or the more expensive units . Once I received this unit it did all and more than what I was expecting . Unit is fast in calculating routes as long as you select what regions you will be traveling to , is very user friendly and highly recommended if you understand using GPS units .. I am very satisfied with this unit !  
2	  I wish I 'd written when I first bought , because surely some didn't buy due to the other review , and I found this keyboard perfect . It 's small - like a laptop , but it 's necessary if you have a keyboard tray where your lap drawer would be on a desk , and it 's not gigantic . this allows me to have the keyboard and a wireless mouse ( full swize ) next to it , on the same level . I 've had it for a year or two , with NO PROBLEMS . LOVE IT .  
2	  Original shipment , power supply connector had bent pin . Email to LaCie , they responded immediately and shipped a replacement power supply at no charge . Hard drive works fine , as advertised .  
1	  I tried calibrating it and it would not take b / c it said my distance did not equal what the sensor tracked . I did 1 mile and it had . 60 . Then I tried half a mile and it said . 30 . Then I did 1 mile and it calculated . 46 . ANNOYING ! I will try it again but it is frustrating and I got it as a Christmas gift and my husband threw away the box so I cannot return it . Edit .. Okay , now it works but I am unable to change the number of stars in my review . I would give it 4 stars ( losing a star for not working properly in the beginning ) .  
2	  These cables are excellent . I was looking for a cable long enough to connect my computer to the home theater . Apparently Belkin and Monster do not make cables this long so I took a chance with these and I am really pleased . The color is white , which would be my only complaint . However it does not look like a cheap cable from the dollar store . The connections are NOT gold pleated but you cannot tell the difference . The sound quality is excellent . I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine .  
2	  This unit is perfect for motorcycle use ! It mounts to the handlebars and talks through your radio . It is shock resistant as well as rain tight .  
2	  I am very impressed with this scanner . It is my first , so I don't have much to compare it to , but it worked extremely well once I figured a few things out . One thing you should be aware of ; since this unit is powered only through the USB cable , Canon strongly recommends that you do not use a longer cable than the one supplied with the scanner . It 's about 5 ' long , which should be long enough for most . Also , as others have stated , it should only be connected to a direct USB port on your computer . ( not a hub , or " daisy chained " with other USB devices ) . Instalation was easy . Just follow the instructions in order . The software is easy to learn if you have the time to play with it . I didn't , so I went to Arcsoft 's web site and downloaded the manual . My first scan was a 3.5 " x 5 " color photo . I set the res at 600 dpi . It took a LONG time . Then I realized I had the scan size set at 8.5 " X 11 " ( duh ) . It was scanning the entire flatbed . Once I adjusted the scan size , it scanned the same photo , at the same res , in only about 20 seconds . And it 's whisper quiet . I have read others complain that that it won't scan 3-D objects well at all . It probably wont . It uses entirely different technology than older " brighter " scanners which need a separate power cord . I don't see this as a problem for me , as 99 % of my scans will be photos or text pages . I would recomed this product to anyone .  
2	  I don't own a lot of differnt lenses but i aways use the Super HMC HAZE UV by hoya . I never had any problems . I dont see any difference in picture quality . Highly recommended !  
2	  I tried the off brand one for 40 bucks and it locked on my 30d to the point I had to destroy it to get it off . the canon one is weather sealed and double locked like the 580ex II flash . it works great .  
2	  Ever since I ditched my barbie dolls for CDs a good 7 or 8 years ago , I 've gone through many players and none have lived up to Sony 's MHC-BX3 compact stereo system . Most players that have rotating disk changers that can hold more than one album at a time break easily and are less reliable but this system has proven very durable . And because I 'm home so much , I tend to use this device for music a lot more than my computer or portable walkman . The eye that reads the content does get dirty rather quickly , causing the songs to skip around , but a cleaner will usually fix that annoying problem ( unless it 's scratched indefinitely ) in about 20 seconds . I 'm sure that goes with any stereo system though because it collects dust in unreachable places . As for the sound quality , no matter what genre I 'm listening to ( classical , rock , techno , new age ) , I am very impressed with the power it emanates . At only 150 watts ( 75 in each speaker ) , the bass sounds like a thunderous roar and the beats are clearly crisp and always of the highest standard . And while you can adjust the menu , I personally feel that everything sounds the best on ' dance ' . I also like how you can select a specific number of songs you want the cassette to seek and it will stop right before the track begins so you don't have to keep pressing stop , play , rewind , play , fast forward , ect , until you find the exact spot you 're looking for ! I do hope to purchase a stereo with even more watts someday but I 'll gladly settle with this until it suddenly ceases to work anymore for I 'm very happy with this system . I especially love the exterior of it , which happens to look very expensive , and the black and silverish gray coloring compliments most any furniture . Through several past experiences , I can attest to the fact that Sony builds some really great products and I try and make sure all the electronics I buy have that label I trust and depend upon . There are two cassettes here ( A & B - one that is able to record ) and the CD player can hold up to 3 albums , which you can even change while one is playing . If you can find it , this is HIGHLY recommended !  
2	  Excellent reception on my end , and the folks on the other end always say I sound loud and clear . What more could you want ? Oh yeah , it 's very comfortable too ! Believe me , I 've tried lots of headsets , and the quality on this Panny set blows away every other one I 've tried - and the price / value ratio is just off the charts . I just ordered my sixth set . I use them on my home cordless phones and on my cellphones . I 've given a couple away to friends , like the gideons give away bibles - because I 'm a true believer ! I keep two in the house ( one for each cordless phone - makes for some awesome conference calls ) and one in the car for the cellphone , and one for a spare just in case , because I don't want to live without them ! Honestly , I 'd gladly pay $ 40 for a set this quality . To get it at this price makes me believe that all may be right in the universe after all .  
1	  The product appears to be everything one would want in a printer - the problem is the drivers . Not only do the drivers take 700 + MB of disk space which is outrageous , but they crash often . In addition , the programs that come with the printer are unstable . Good hardware , poor drivers make this a pass .  
1	  System looks great . It probably sounds great too . Package comes with 5 speakers , 1 subwoofer , a large assortment of wires and cables , AND NO INSTRUCTIONS ! I studied medicine , not acoustic engineering . I called AMAZON , and they told me that I either had to send the system back , at a cost of about $ 80.00 , or contact the manufacturer . None of the websites for " Genius Home theater " are active , so I can't reach them . If anyone out there knows how to hook one of these up , please let me know . Finally got this configured properly . Was actually pretty simple . Guess I 'm just dense . Sounds fabulous , and that 's really all that counts .  
2	  This Canon light is very good for Weddings and other Family events . It lights up all the dark areas and makes the subjects lighter .  
2	  The Casio Exilim 770 requires high-speed flash when used to record movies . The Ultra II seems to work flawlessly .  
1	  The product information lists the measurements for this unit , but if you are like me measurements probably don't help you much . This MP3 player is huge . One reviewer wrote that it would easily fit in his hand or pocket , well so would my cell phone and guess what they are practically the same size . Compared to some of the Sony and Samsung units this thing is a Cadillac . The sound quality is very good , but not better than my wife 's Samsung , which she can easily clip to her shirt or put in her pocket . Putting this thing in my shirt pocket makes my shirt sag and putting it in my pants pocket . . . well , you get the idea .  
2	  Not a tremendous sound difference from the $ 30 plastic crappy headphones I had , however , they fit much more snugly and cut out alot more outside sounds . This all in all makes for a much better listening experience . Also they are about twice as loud . This is no doubt largely because of the superior isolation and snugness . Also the build quality is fantastic . I don't see these breaking any time soon and that was the main reason I got them ! The inner part of my ear lobe rubbed against the inside / unpadded part to the point where it was noticably red and irritated .. no matter how I tried to position them . I fixed this by inserting some light thin foam padding .. something I feel they should have done to improve the comfort of these . When I need more sets for my studio I 'm building , I 'll probably buy several more of these unless I see something better .. but for the price I doubt it ! :-) I give em 4 out of 5 because of the lack of inner ear padding .  
1	  I cannot rate the item as it never worked and I had to return it . I am hoping the new one will be in working order .. it just arrived so I cannot say more . I was not overly pleased at the length of time it took to send me a new one .. I sent it UPS on Mar 6th and received the new on Mar 21 but only after I sent an email asking where it was . I was promised a $ 7.50 credit on the postage that I paid .. Have not seen that as yet but I am hopeful .  
1	  The only good thing about the Zune is the amount of gigs for the price . The software will prompt you to update which will mess up your music library . You can find the fix on the forum , but it is a lot of work to fix . Many of the Zune owners including myself have had trouble with the players resetting during listening . There is no fix yet for this . There are many types of issues with the Zune and its all models not just this one . I honestly wish I had bought an IPOD . If there is no resetting fix by next year I am buying an IPOD . Sorry Zune , I wanted to like you .  
2	  I learned that there were $ 3 HDMI cords for sale ( $ 0.01 and $ 2.99 S + H ) and I was a bit skeptical at first , but after I recieved both my cords ( Was such a good deal I bought another one an hour later , even though I doubted they would be any good ) any bit of skepticism was gone . I have not had a single problem with these cords , and use them to play my Xbox 360 and my PS3 on my 1080p tv constantly , beautiful and definitely got more than I expected ! Works as good as my $ 40 cord . *  
2	  I 've had this mouse for about 4 months and really love it ! I am trying to find one for my laptop as well . It is smooth and easy to handle . I would definitely recommend it for your PC.I have developed carpal tunnel from using another wireless mouse for my laptop which requires a more forceful click . I can really tell the difference from using this MS mouse and the other red one .  
1	  I bought these pair of headphone because I have a good history with sony products and with good reason . They felt good in the ears , the sounds was good , and the price was one of the best things about it . While at school I noticed there was a buzzing sound coming from the right side . At first I thought it was just the headphones moving around in the headphone jack , so I ignored it . A little later I start hearing these loud sparking noises coming from my head phones and take them off , I don't know what may have caused this but I thought I was going to be shocked in the inside of my ear . I still hear sparking noises coming from my headphones but I see no real sparks when looking at it . Either way I am not risking getting shocked in the ear .  
1	  I bought this player for my girlfriend last Christmas . She loved it , and used it all the time . Unfortunately , over the summer the control stick stopped working . The player is one solid piece , so you can't even open it up to attempt a repair . Rio charges $ 70 for a replacement if you still have the receipt . No thanks , I 'll try another brand from now on .  
1	  I bought this unit because I had an other " Brother " before . What a mistake . I had it for over a year , very light use ( a few copies , a few faxes ) . The machine uses a lot of ink . It performs self-cleaning every day . You run out of ink in a few months even if you are not using it . With no ink you cannot send or receive faxes ( even you are out of yellow and the fax report is printed black ) . Now I cannot send faxes at all , I am getting some " com " error . Its memory is full all the time ( 99 %) and sometimes prevents you sending faxes . Do not waste your money , go other place .  
1	  These particular cables just do not work . The supplier was responsive and replaced them but the second batch had the identical problems . Again the supplier responded promptly with a refund but just beware of some manufacturer HDMI cables .  
1	  It takes way too long to set the time and alarms . You need to hold down the Forward button forever ! If you change your wake-up time frequently , you will waste many minutes of each day holding down the damn forward button to get to the appropriate hour . I recieved this alarm clock in the mail today , and am returning it tomorrow .  
1	  I Luv tha color but when I took them out the pack one of the wre was already hanging . So I couldn't even ue them ! I 'd swap for anouther par if they worked ! I would of Luv 'd to see what they sound 'd like come out of bothspeaker .  
1	  This router has always acted strange with both of my macs . It seems like anywhere from every 7 to 20 minutes , it just stops loading internet signals .. but stays " connected " to the computer . Which means I am constantly hitting " turn airport off " waiting 5 seconds , and then hitting " turn airport on " and it works again . SO , since this happens on both of my macs , obviously I would not recommend it to any mac user . For the most part , there are no PC related problems in my household . The only other problem with this router is something that developed a few months after purchase . It used to not matter which was turned on first : the modem or the router .. but now our router is a spaz . It seems to get confused if it gets turned on first . So the only way ANY of the computers ( wired / wireless , pc / mac / xbox ) can connect to the internet is if the modem is turned on first , and you wait for it to connect entirely to the internet .. and then you can plug in the router . This used to be really frustrating because our modem would disconnect often .. so we would have to turn that off , then on , wait for it to connect , and then turn the router on . Overall , this router takes the convenience out of wifi through the hassles that it presents . Don't buy it . I would definitely recommend that Apple wireless router .. but that 's a bit expensive , so just LOOK AROUND . In any case , just don't buy this one . It 's a piece of junk .  
1	  Bought this after seeing great reviews . Tried it when it arrived , and it did not work . Went and bought a decent HDMI cable and TV worked fine . Plus , to return , you have to pay for shipping . Makes Amazon look bad ..  
1	  I love the looks of this case ; although , I am concerned a bit about the front cover . Wish I didn't have to open it every time to turn unit on . Now for the bad - my PSU didn't last the 1 + years that most do .. it died in 2 days ! I am VERY disappointed since the reason I bought this case was b / c of Antec 's reputation for great power supplies . Sonata II uses completely different PSU so I 'm guessing Antec figured out this PSU is junk .  
2	  Love this for my laptop . replaced a USB wireless connector which was bulky and using precious ports . Install was quick with CD , connection is superb at the max rate , and worth every penny of the $ 50ish I paid .  
1	  Unfortunatelly - and for my surprise - this item didn't worked for me . I was quite anxious about getting this item -I am based at Uruguay-South America and this kind of items are unusual here - but when I opened the package , connected to my laptop and tried to turned on using the switch - by the way , nice feature if it ever worked - nothing happened . Now I have a useless nice gizmo .  
1	  Don't buy this Man 804RC2 unless you try it first with your gear to be sure it does what you want ( i.e. , don't buy on name or photo alone ) . All the bearings are dry plastic-on-plastic . I needed this to hold my high optical-powered gear steady and to get there smoothly and easily . Instead , every movement is jerk , jerk , jerk - oversteer , jerk , jerk , - understeer , - jerk , jerk .. same . Almost better to handhold your gear and rest it on a tree . I finally resorted to spraying WD-40 in the joints and it actually improved things a bit . Total waste of money and time . I can't imagine what use they had in mind or what customer would find this acceptable . It 's just a complicated-looking toy pan and tilt head .  
2	  Don't understand why anyone would pay $ 40 for the same cable just because it 's made by Monster Cable . This is a cable that carries a digital signal so what is Monster claming they do better . I only payed $ 12.99 and it works perfect !  
1	  I was very unimpressed with these speakers . I was simply looking for a decent pair of speakers to put on my patio with an old low power tuner . With the loudness setting off and the Bass BELOW the center mark , the speakers rattle as if I were playing them for a party . I would not reccomend the purchase of these speakers to anyone who actually enjoys even decent quality sound .  
2	  I ordered this item for my Canon S5IS so I would be able to use camera Filters , Polarizer , Neutral Density etc . I ordered the Digital Concepts lens adapter , but the one I got was stamped with the Opteka brand . I have no complaints with the Opteka that I received , it is made of aluminum and very sturdy . It attaches to my S5 very snugly and it makes using filters a breeze .  
2	  Good fits well and is perfect for protecting the lens and cutting some of the uv light on bright days .  
2	  The main problem with my Palm TX is the fact that I 'm forever misplacing the stylus . I now have several on my workstation , they have built in pens as well .  
1	  This pad looks great and provides good cooling . However , the cooling pad only worked for approximately one month . I use an HP 15.5 " laptop that tends to run hot when the video card is being utilized greatly for movies or games . The laptop runs so hot that it is harming the monitor and I will need to have it replaced . The Altec Laptop Cooling Pad worked great for about one month . It lowered the heat of the laptop considerably . The laptop was no longer hot to the touch and the monitor was not being harmed . However , after one month , the fans worked intermittently and then ceased functioning altogether . The pad was receiving power ( the LED light showed that power was being received ) and I tried toggling the fan speed between high and low , but nothing . Bottom line : Great laptop cooler for about one month . After that , it will cease functioning .  
1	  I purchased this camera in November 2002 . For almost 2 years it functioned perfectly , then about 6 weeks ago , I suddenly had a black screen . It is now in for repair for the black screen problem for the third time in 6 weeks . Fortunately , I purchased a 4 year extended warranty policy , and it hasn't cost me for the attempted repairs . I didn't know the problem could be corrected by whacking the camera ! However , under the extended warranty no lemon policy , after this 3rd attempt to fix the problem , I will be able to get a full purchase price credit towards a new camera of my choice . ( Thanks Best Buy ) . I will stick with the Sony because I have the extra memory sticks , but I will definately buy the extended warranty again .  
1	  Not a reliable product , ear cushion just fell off , wow , poor product . I had heard sound was nice , and it was for a short moment  
2	  For those of you looking forward to using the audio optical output to connect to your receiver , beware that the 87 series will only output HDMI audio to the standard audio jacks . You would need to look at the 89 series to optical out with HDMI .  
1	  The camera feels solid and it is , quite easy to use . The fixed focus and no choice of compression mode make it impossible to get a sharp picture , espacially with nature shots . It always comes out fuzzy . I regret my purchase .  
1	  1 month after I ordered it , they finnaly told me they couldn't ship if to my APO address . After this , I cancled the order and am buying it from somewhere else .  
1	  one of the c / d players is not working at allthe reason it was bout is so we could have 2 c / d player and so happends that only one works is not acceptable . Yes it was used but it does not say taht is not working at its fulest before we purchasteed . its nof fair .  
2	  I 've owned this player for 9 months and it is great . To answer a couple of past reviews - Iomega has update the firmware ( available at their site ) where the shutoff time is now 2 minutes and the playlists are now saved when it shuts down . There are a few other enchancements also ( See update documentation ) . Disks are very durable - but care must be taken when inserting - it must be done exactly with care . Do not force . This player is also a very good audible player for listening to audible books ( audible . com ) - very easy to use . Disks do not hold as much music as more higher memory units but extra disks are easly to cary and also this unit can be used as a drive for the computer - so music files can be easily transfered to the disk through Windows Explorer with no additional music controling program needed .  
2	  Easy to install . Just slide it in a spare PCI slot , & Windows finishes the rest of the installation !  
2	  Great . I wished I would have ordered either two or a bigger one . They all fit great inside the bag . The netting holds them in place securely .  
2	  Shiping was about the time you estimate . The condition of the merchandise is excellant . I realy enjoy it ! Thank you very much !  
2	  I cannot really deduct a star for my wanting too much or not fully realizing what I was buying , however it is much taller ( roughly 15 inches ) than I anticipated and the neck is much narrower ( 1.25 " at its narrowest ) so one needs an uncommonly long bottle brush to clean it and it will be a bit harder to get ice into it than I would like ( think ice clumped together in a bag purchased while traveling ) . I did not get the 48oz wide mouth versionThermos Nissan 48-Ounce Wide Mouth Stainless-Steel Bottlebecause the top seemed to be a pain to clean and prone to failure . I did not get theZojirushi Premium Thermal 1.85 liter Carafe , Brushed Stainless Steelbecause , knowing me , I 'd just break the glass . It does perform its job very well . It keeps a batch of coffee hot all day long with little worry about it spilling if you keep it on its side in the car and it pours very well . There are carve outs for the liquid and replacement air on two sides of the screw in top ( the arrows on top point them out ) , so when you loosen the top 2 turns , the coffee pours out without any mess at all .  
2	  First of all , this is probably what you are looking for , unless you want to be able to take photographs above 640 x 420 resolution , zoom or focus , but then you are looking for a pro webcam , and there are one or two here , but you are better spending your $ 100 in a digital photography shop . For the rest of you that just want a plug n ' play digital camera that not only looks great but doesn't smash to pieces by the end of the week because it fell off the monitor , at an affordable price , actually very cheap for what it does , then the Logitech Quickcam Communicate WebCam is exactly what you need .. and what everyone else owns . Do not looks fool you . This black orb is just bigger than an egg and does not come on a flat triangle base as advertised , but a claw grip that you can bend around almost anything but is especially designed for LCD monitors , but has no problem with CRT or desks . In fact it has the same grip as the Quickcam pro model from Logitech and maybe if you look at this products photographs you can see it . Okay , so that is your stand . The camera itself looks like HAL from 2001 . Pity the central camera lens doesn't glow red , ha aha . It even lights up blue on top when on . Very snazz camera , period . The ball orb camera thing must click into the stand . The directions do not make this very clear and some may be inclined to just let the camera orb rest on the stand , but it clicks into place so that it can bend and rotate on its axis firmly attached to the claw grip . The cable is a direct camera to USB2 that runs about the height of an average person , so if you want it to see further you need a USB2 to USB2 extension . However the cable is adequate for most . With XP driver installation is crazy at best . Do not use the windows drivers or the webcam may cause Windows crashing . Do not plug in the webcam . Insert the CD . Install the driver software . Then you are prompted to plug in your webcam and follow what Logitech tell you to do . Okay , now you have the camera set so you can take photographs and camera video with it . XP just crashes the cam if you do not use the Logitech drivers . One last tip . Avoid lighting at the camera directly by using a reading light behind the camera aimed at you . This will boost your image quality considerably . The autofocus is near perfect for the price . You will not have to adjust this camera except to move it around . In short , this is what you should have unless you want zoom , focus and high quality photographic images . You can use this for free with Yahoo messenger or MSN . 320 x 240 is a fine resolution to run at . This camera can do 640 x 420 . Just get it , call home , force them to upgrade to broadband and end those $ 100 transatlantic phone calls . FREE VID-PHONE if you have a microphone ! In which case see into getting yourself a gaming headset or similar .  
2	  All the colours line up to my stereo ( CDXGT565UP ) and the only reason it doesnt get a 5/5 is the fact that I still have to figure out how to hook up the power wire to my stock power antenna ( all Vibes / Matrix 's will have this issue ) . Not a large concern though , as I found the power antenna wire very close to the antenna itself . I hope to simply hook up the power antenna wire to a ACC POWER wire , and all will be ok .  
1	  I purchased in August . It 's now January and the battery regularly becomes so hot I burn myself on the tip ( that you insert into the laptop ) sometimes and am generally worried it will start a fire . I only have it plugged in while I 'm watching it . I avoided generic batteries for just this reason ! Will be seeking warranty exchange through Toshiba .  
1	  The photocyan cartridge ( BCI-6PC ) from onSale is not as advertised ( it is not a Canon product ) , does not work , and is pure junk . Beware .  
1	  I was not very Pleased with this battery it is about one third as good as a canon battery . It will last until u charge your canon battery . Wayne P.  
2	  The product works just as advertised . The size is great in that it can fit in a pocket . But you should have the accessory case , that I did buy . One complaint is that in order to register the product you have to do it online and through the device itself . That menas you need a " mini-usb " cable that is an accessory . I ordered it through Amazon with no problem . But it should come with the product . It cost about $ 10.00 from Amazon . I still have been unable to connect to Garmin with the cable and contacting support has been impossible ..  
1	  I purchased this camera without much thought - my bad . I took one picture and it wouldn't take another . Long story short , my vendor supplied the camera with an 8 mb memory card and after one picture it couldn't take another without that picture being deleted . It is supposed to come with a 16 mb card , which would not be much better . The product description says the 16mb card will hold 14 images . Do you really want a camera that will only hold 14 images ? I tried plugging in a 512kb card and it would't take it . Don't know why anyone would be as dumb as me and buy this thing . I don't know what the picture quality is like , I would have had to buy the cable , because I didn't get one . Be sure and read the fine print of what you are getting - don't assume !  
1	  I bought this card after reading many positive reviews on Amazon . I 'm about to return it after a week of unsuccessfully getting it to work in my environment . I tried the card in a Dell Inspiron 8100 running Windows XP Professional , communicating with my Linksys WAP11 . The main problem is that it takes many attempts before the card actually connects to the Linksys access point , and no sequence of steps will get it to reconnect reliably . I am using the latest SMC driver and utility from the SMC website .. After digging through the SMC online FAQ , I noticed that they recommend you disable WEP ( encryption ) if you 're not using an SMC-brand access point . Disabling WEP did help a few times in getting connected , but it didn't make any lasting difference . Regardless , what 's the point of having this card if they recommend against using WEP with a different AP provider ? What kind of interoperability is that ? Also , SMC makes no reference to actually supporting Windows XP with this card . Digging deeper revealed that this card is NOT WiFi-certified ( just check the online WiFi-compliant hardware list ) , nor does SMC advertise WEP support anywhere in their in product data sheet . Their meager 128-bit encryption configuration can only use the 1st out of 4 encryption keys anyway . In contrast , the Cisco Aironet 350 PC card I 've used here on a similar laptop has worked perfectly . The Aironet integrates better with Windows XP control panels , is WiFi certified , and has absolutely no issues getting connected to the Linksys WAP - you turn on the laptop and it 's connected . I plan on replacing the SMC card with an Agere Orinoco Gold PC card , which is also WiFi-certified , supports 128-bit WEP , and is XP-compatible ..  
1	  I feel I was mislead BIG TIME . Picture shows a box of TEN but say 's only one disk hidden under technical details . Verbatim disk are very good disk but if you want MORE than just ONE don , t buy this ONE . Not worth sending back so I feel I was ripped off .  
2	  I think the mini ipods are great however , I would recomment buying them from apple . com until Amazon gets the new version in stock . Its the same price if you use a student discound otherwise the price is $ 20 more . However then newer model has 18 hours of battery life vs . 8 and the scroll button is illuminated

1	  I got this mouse to use about 4 hours a day when not at my docking station . It has some great features , like the on / off switch , the size ( not to big , not to small ) and the 90 degree swivel receiver . Unfortunately it has been made very cheaply and does not work about 15 % of the time you are trying to use it and about 25 % of the time it will work sporadically so lately I have been opting to use my Touchpad rather than see if it wants to work . I have had mine for about 1-2 months and have replaced 3 sets of batteries ; even with the on / off switch it drains batteries . If it would work I could put up with the battery drain but as it is I would not recommend this mouse .  
2	  The Logitech Trackman Wheel is the only computer mouse our house uses . I have one for my desktop and my husband uses one for his laptop and we love them . We would never go back to the conventional mouse . They are comfortable and easy to use . We also have the cordless version but we found that we liked the wired ones better . The cordless wasn't as dependable and went through batteries too often . I am sure you will not be disappointed with this Logitech Trackman Wheel !  
1	  I ordered this Elite screen after receiving 2 defective Ultra 100 " screens . The customer service rep assured me these were more sturdy , yet it arrived with parts loose rattling around inside and the screen just unraveled out instead of the spring-loaded stuff , and will never go back in . The reviews for Elite screens are even WORSE than the reviews for Ultra screens . These under $ 100 screens seem to be worth it only if you are prepared to leave it hanging down always .  
1	  Memory Stick works fine . Initially the adaptor that came with the packet didnt work . I complained with Amazon who redirected me to the seller itself . Seller promptly sent me another adaptor which were two in number , neither of them worked again . I tried by using the adaptor with multiple computers , story remains the same . Even though i am fine with the service provided , the quality of the product is not at all good .  
2	  We always get uv filters , primarily to act as protection for the lens itself . This one fits , so it does what we need .  
1	  D-Link is not providing a driver for Windows 7 64 bit operating system . I will not buy another product from D-Link or any other company ( if I can help it ) , that doesn't provide drivers for a new mainstream operating system for relatively recent hardware releases . For the lack of some simple driver software , this hardware is completely useless with Windows 7 . There should be a law !  
2	  This TV is an unbelievable deal . I love mine . I bought several of them for my business . Everyone who has seen them thinks it cost a lot more than they do . Flat screen is the only way to go . It has all of the inputs needed for DVD or a dish . The remote is easy to use and the picture is awsome . You will not regret buying this .  
1	  i bought this keyboard about 1 yr ago . this morning , after a routine cleaning , the enter key , both shift keys and the question mark key stopped working . i tried a lot of things to fiz the problem , apparently , the letter ' aks ' stops working as well . anyway , in the end , i realized it was the keyboard itself .. i remember when i decided to purchase this keyboard , even though the price of this keyboard was on the high end of all the keyboards that were available . however , i felt like since this is something that im gonna use everyday , i might well just spend the money and buy something thats going to last . but now , just after using it for little for a yr , the keyboard is done .. i mean the keyboard looks nice , big , easy to use , but in terms of reliability , it is pretty poorly constructed ..  
2	  Sure this lens isn't an L , but for a starter or a cheap walk around it 's great . I bought it as a walk around instead of buying a point and shoot . It 's much better then any P & S camera I 've tried , and cheaper then most of the good ones too . For the stuff I really want good IQ on I use my primes . I only gave it 4 stars because I don't use it as much as my other lenses , and it is a little cheap feeling . But it 's very light which helps on long hikes so I can deal with it being somewhat cheap feeling .  
1	  Sony DNF430 MP3 / ATRAC CD Walkman Portable Compact Disc Player with AM / FM / TV / Weather Digital TunerI bought this to play audio CDs and listen occasionally to the radio based on star ratings . After a lot of fooling around I was able to get the volume control to work about half the time . The radio works and it plays CDs . None of the menu and various setup features are accessible . The instructions are useless ; it 's all by trial and error , mostly error . There is a toggle switch that seems to be central to the operation , but it is largely unresponsive . Working it several times usually results in a volume adjustment , but other times it switches away to unbidden modes . This gadget has endless features with impenetrable secret codes required to use them . I would certainly never buy this model again . There must be better products on the market .  
2	  Digital may have taken over the photo world , but the classic polariod still has its place . We bought this camera for a cub scout event . We were holding a sign-up night and had the kids making picture frames . We took pictures of the kids with the polaroid and sent them home with a framed picture of themselves from their first night in cub scouts . We could have used a digital camera with a printer , but that would have been more cumbersome . You still can't beat an instant camera for things like this . I would not use it for my one and only camera , but it is good for those special situations when you have to have a hard copy print right away .  
1	  This is not an inexpensive TV . This is a cheap TV ! Do yourself a favor and stay away . It is guaranteed to fail ( perhaps repeatedly ) . I 've yet to meet anyone who has had one of these go for more than 3 years without a failure . Mine failed twice in 18 months - naturally the second failure was 30 days out of warranty ! Oh and Vizio will scold you for not buying the extended warranty rather than apologize for a crappy product .  
2	  The EXP503 is ultra-portable it can play up to 20 hours on four AA batteries and it includes headphones , a belt-clip , and an AC / DC adapter . With an added car kit , you can even take your MP3s on the road . These are built to last lifetime . It will probably out last my car .  
2	  When I bought this a year ago , it was even more expensive than what now I got the T10 512MB for . T10 lasts longer , looks more fancy with colored body and colored LCD display . But for some reason , I like 180T even more . Sychronizing MP3 to T10 is a pain . The T10 went dead now and then when connected via USB to my IBM T40 laptop . Struggling for an hour , I got only three songs in .  
2	  Prompt order fulfillment , and great price for this OEM product which I ordered as a replacement for use with my Dell Axim X51v PDA .  
2	  This mounting rack is super easy to install . The only thing that I don't like about it is that you have to get anchors and different screws if you want to mount this rack on sheetrock . The anchors and screws cost $ 8.00 at Lowes and are super easy to install . Once that is done , the rest of the install of the rack is super easy . Has a clean finish , and feels sturdy . If using for a public place the lock bar has screws with a " key " to it so that someone can't walk off with the tv .  
1	  WARNING : If you need to run a usb cable over 15 ' , I 'd recommend to NOT purchase a standard cable like this . I used this cable to connect to a remote powered hub , and had nothing but continuous problems with all my USB devices , which even interfered with my Vista OS such that the PC wouldn't even boot up until I disconnected all the USB peripherals , presumably due to signal loss over that distance . All my USB peripherals performed erraticaly with this cable . The product should include this warning . So , I have just purchased a USB Active Extension Booster cable which I hope will resolve the problem of signal attenuation . The cable may be adequate for a single remote USB device like a printer , but you 'd be safer to get the booster cable to avoid the hassle .  
1	  This is the fourth DVD player ( second Philips brand ) to fail after one year of use . It always happens within a month or two of the warranty expiration . This time , the unit just won't turn on . Other times , the players began to fail at reading discs , occasionally at first , then for most discs . I am really frustrated with buying a new unit every year . I tried to get Philips to honor the warranty since the player failed just one month out of warranty , but they wouldn't do it . They offered a refurbished replacement for $ 30 - with only a 90 day warranty - definiely not a good deal . I will boycott Philips products from now on , and I hope you do so , too .  
2	  Excellent headphones . This is the 5th set of headphones I 've gone through and I 'll be sticking with these for awhile for a few reasons . First , they 're durable and made to last . The headband is padded and strong and won't snap , warp , or bend . The cups are very secure . And , most importantly , the single wire config is well protected , especially at the point of connection on the cup . Second , the sound is excellent . Very clear and crisp . I mean VERY CLEAR and CRISP . The sound really surrounds the ear because of the 50mm cups which really adds to encompassing you in the music . I used to have a problem with the bass , but then I found out that it was the source of the music that made the bass shallow ( my laptop ) . When I went to a different source ( my walkman ) I really knew what they meant by the Brainshaker Technology . These headphones are not very good at filtering out external noises , but I don't mind , in fact I prefer it that way . I like to know what 's going on around me .  
2	  This is good product , but the setup necessary to get it going was not effective until I visited the Skype website . This step led me to disable the computer 's microphone functions in order to get the headset to work . After that the thing worked very well . I like being able to move around and talk on the phone and it works well with XM over the computer as well . A good purchase .  
2	  Noteworthy for their eye-blinking impact and up-front presentation . If Sennheiser ' phones sound like the Amsterdam Concertgebouw , these sound like CBGB 's . Considered by many to be the best rock headphones in the world . I like them quite well for jazz and classical ( especially solo performances ) , but for rock they really do get your head banging ! Weakness include a narrow " in your head " soundstage , not the best build quality ( plastic ) , some people find them uncomfortable ( I don't . They 're quite lightweight , but they touch your ears when you wear them , and some people just don't like that I guess ) , but the kicker is for them to sound their best you really have to change the pads . " Change the pads .. " you ask ? For the most bass , do a Google for ' Todd the Vinyl Junkie ' and pick up a pair of Grado flat pads . For the best balance ( and to save a little money ) go to Sennheiser 's site and grab a pair of replacement pads for the HD-414s . They 're yellow , and you have to cut a hole in them ( about an inch and a quarter ) but it 's well worth it . Probably not truly a 5-star ' phone in the grand scheme of things ( like the Sennheiser Orpheus or Stax Omega II ) , but their strong suits are unmatched by any other manufacturer 's headphones at any price .  
2	  Just combined a Nikon Coolpix S8000 with the Nikon 5811 Coolpix Leather Case in a non-intended way , but love the results . It was a shock to slide my brand new camera into a case that came up on Amazon , as I placed the order , and find that it was not long enough , with the camera inside , to allow the magnetic closure to fasten . Once the inner tabs at the bottom of the case were pulled to the outside , the combo worked like a gem , though a bit strange to have " bunny ears " sticking out . Following a couple weeks of use , the ears are hugging around the bottom of the case , hardly noticeable . The case is very well made , quite protective , and fits like a glove , taking up no extra space . I just have to be sure the battery is adequately charged and there is sufficient memory card space , for there is no extra room for anything , unless you would slide the item under the belt loop , which I do not use . If you are looking for a nice protective case , small enough to make the camera always accessible in a pocket or purse , this combination can fit the bill .  
2	  Worked perfectly out of the box ! no especial steps required . just put it into your device and that 's it !  
1	  In less than a month and less than 75 pages the ink finished eventhough the indicator still saying half full ( or half empty ) ; not at all satisfied with this product .  
1	  I don't know if it 's because my PC is Windows XP Spanish but the installation software fails to even start . So in the end , I can ; t use this little bugger . I yet haven't tried it in my Windows 7 English , but I don't expect a successUPDATE : I tried it in W7 English . The software does install but when I run it , it shows the message : Photo Viewer can't open or is owned by another program , or something like that . That message does show in the troubleshoot manual , but I can't solve it the way they mention . I never get the option to select USB Charge or Update . My frame only shows : USB Connected and that 's it .

2	  I bought this case for my Canon SD600 . Excellent very well made case that is just the right size , has excellent padding , and room for an extra battery and memory card . looks nice too and you can't beat the price !  
1	  I don't really like these as they are only good to organize your cord when not wearing the earbuds and I needed something to use while wearing them .  
1	  I had a S45 and after loving that camera and quite frankly beating the heck out of it taking photos of two kids and needed a new one . I am now needing repair for the second time . After buying the canon camera bag , I managed to drop it after having it for all of three weeks and the lense cracked . Now 13 months later I can't get the lense cover to close . Very frustrating .  
1	  Purchased icap recently , great concept , poor quality execution . The caps were so thin and flimsy , they wouldn't stay on the iphone earbuds . They won't stay in your ears , either . Don't waste your money .  
1	  Okay , I bought these headphones a few years ago and they broke in about 6 months . I loved them at the time so much that I wanted another pair and figured it was just a fluke . Well , I returned them and got a new pair and they said that my power switch had gone bad and replaced the unit . Then about 7 months later they broke again , I called to return them again and they said I could not return them a second time . Seems to me I should be able to return something as many times as I like since they 're not give quality product to keep . Since I couldn't return them they offered to sell me another pair at a discounted price to help me with my problem . Mind you this was another brand new pair ! So here it is six months later and once again , BAM ! power switch stops working while its sitting on the charger . I have had enough with these people and there overpriced crap they peddle off on us . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !  
2	  The BEFW11S4 v2 and WET11 work perfectly with my XBOX . Easy setup , out of box and playing games in about 20 minutes . The router is on the second floor and the bridge is in the basement . No lag ! No cables strung around the house ! This product fit the bill nicely .  
1	  Was a horrible purchase . I turned it up to about % 50 and it blew the speakers and made this HORRIBLE noise if you turned it up past quiet . I do NOT recommend this to anybody . The speakers were not defective just not very well made .  
1	  This model is quite slow , but it 's not Iomega 's fault , but just a result of it using the parallel port . The usage of the parallel port also uses CPU cycles , so while the thing is copying data , you might not be able to anything else but watch the egg timer . Spend your money on a CD-R instead . A CD-R drive might cost a little bit more , but the media is MUCH cheaper , holds MUCH more data , and is more durable than the Zip format . If you must buy a Zip drive , don't buy the parallel port model , it 's far too slow for impatient people ( like me . )  
2	  I have a Speck cover for my macbook , and sticking it into this sleeve is a bit tight but I think after time , the case will stretch out . It 's very well padded . Nice looking . Maintains it shape ( I 've had it for 4 months so far ) . Case looks great , not boring like the traditional black neoprene cases .  
2	  Great price because it fit my old ipod . works very well . absolutely no problems after 15 hours underwater lap swimming .  
2	  After researching different brands of DVR ` s , I settled on this unit and now , after using it for a full month , am completely satisfied with it . Not owning a DVR before , I found this unit to be fairly easy to learn , and it provides ALL the features I need . I record my camcorder vhs tapes directly to the hard drive , and then " leap frog " them to a dvd , I also edit different scenes and am able to create the " perfect " home movie . I realy would recommend this product as I find the versatality of it truely amazing ..  
2	  la marca y el modelo son muy buenos . y el precio excelente , tiempo aceptable de envio . Ningun problema en el pago , todo bien . .  
2	  I am using this to feed video to an LCD projector . I was afraid that the picture quality would suffer , but no worries . It looks great . Vibrant colors and no noise . I am not using the audio , so I cannot comment on that . One complaint , though . If you are in the habit of using premium cables you 're out of luck here . The plastic molding on the external case of these units is so close to the outside of the RCA jacks that there is no room for the thicker connectors found on high-end cables . The unit comes with two video / audio cables of the standard variety , and they fit fine . I wish I could use premium cables .  
1	  My computer was always getting extremely hot ( the program Speedfan said from 75-80C ) . So I looked around at all the highest rated fans around and I figured that this should do the job . I was really hoping this really lowered the temperature . However , I got this home and found it lowered only by around 3 degrees Celsius . Not bad , but definately not what I was hoping for . The dual fans under the holes ( yes , they hard to see in that pic ) are fairly weak . Like the littlest amount of air you could blow if asked to blow wind at something . Besides that , it is solidly constructed and doesn't let hot air get on your lap .  
1	  You can get a near equal quality one for around five bucks ( including shipping ) on sites like meritline .  
1	  Cheap and great in the beginning . Worked like a charm . Never had to change the station despite driving through 8 different states . However , after the first 6 months , it became very picky and had to be constantly wiggled to get the reception . Now , less than a year after purchasing it , it no longer works . Every time you 'd hit a bump in the road it 'd get knocked out of transmission because it had become unbearably picky . Required constant wiggling and adjusting during the last 6 months of it 's approximately one year ( but actually a little less ) lifespan . Not recommended for long-term use .  
2	  This kit has everything you need to build a computer . I wish I had this when I built my own computer . The tools are good quality and the case doesn't feel cheaply made at all . The price was great too !  
2	  If you are one of many people , that like to cook fast , and don't have much time to spend boiling and preparing food , this is the right pressure cooker for you . Just keep in mind that , you need to be very careful , and wait for all air pressure to come out before remove the lid . I recommend this product to all . Enjoy !  
2	  The Kingston 2 BG Mini SD card is a quality product and it was sold at a very reasonable price . Mini-SD cards can be harder to find than regular SD cards or even the Micro-SD cards but this one was shipped super fast and has performed very well in our daughter 's well used Christmas HD Camcorder . I highly recommend this product from this seller .  
2	  I 've bought several of these ink cartridges in the past and they have all worked flawlessly ! I 've tried buying other brands , but they didn't perform like the Epson cartridges .  
2	  I bought this bag to hold my Asus ee pc 8gb laptop . It has a 7-inch screen . This is the perfect sized bag for it , and there 's enough room for a little mouse and my flash drive case in the second pocket . There 's plenty of padding . I have dropped it once ( about 2 feet onto a wood floor ) , and my ee pc is just fine . Very good product . Well worth it .  
2	  Commercial Advance - * Watching Baseball games in half the time - * Never missing Eastender ( for my wife ) - * ( at least until BBC America make it disappear / go to pay per view ) Pause live TV when the kids want to show you something - * Watch something recorded whilst recording - * See - more than 4 stars . Downside - sometimes shuts recordings off " early " - and I haven't found a way of recording + 1H apart from making a manual recording . The blue light on the front is too bright .  
2	  bought this item for a fishing trip to Canada , product worked just like it advertized , would recommend to anyone . For the price you cannot beat it .  
2	  I 'm all about simplifying my cables . The less the better ! This cable is perfect for my dual monitor setup . Update 2/2/2013 : Seven months still working great .  
2	  Because it is getting harder and harder to find these tapes in my area , I ordered from Amazon . Received them in a timely manner and very pleased with my purchase .  
2	  If you 're looking for a generic color printer , the C80 is most likely your best choise , even compared with more expensive printers . It is fast , economical , quiet ( except for the paper-feed mechanism ) and prints excellent quality text , graphics and images in both B & W ; and color . I use it with XP , without any problems - true plug and play , without the need of any driver installation . However , if you 're buying the C80 for photo-quality prints , you 'll probably get disapointed . Before I bought it , I read many user reviews describing the C80 's photo prints as " dull " - this is exactly the case . I tried a number of print options ( and the C80 gives you plenty ) on photo-quality Epson paper - in all cases , the feeling was that the print came out OK , but didn't have the sharpness I was expecting ( " dull colors " is the right word ) . Another disadvantage , is the print sizes : does not have the " bordlerless photo " capability , and needs some trial-error based adjustments in the print options to print even standard photo sizes ( 4x6 , 3x5 etc ) . Very reluctantly , because it 's a great printer , I decided to return for a true Photo Printer .  
2	  Order this item directly from Eton website . Cost is 9.95 plus 6.95 for shipping .  
2	  I cannot say enough good about this unit I have had it in 4 different units . ' pickup , car , motorcycle , quad . On each unit it worked with not one problm . I would put an address in and it would put me with in 10 feet of my dest . If you went off corse it would reroute you right now . The only thing that I could see wrong with it is the speed did not match what I was in , but that could be the vehicle I was in . Over all I am very pleased with the 550 . papajoe  
1	  I would not recommend this printer . Print quality is poor and the ink cartridges are expensive .  
1	  I purchased this laptop in March 2011 as a birthday present for my son and it stopped working in August 2011 . All of a sudden the screen stopped functioning . When I took the laptop to an apple store to get it diagnosed they advised it needed a new LCD and it would cost another couple hundred dollars . Betamacs will not do anything since it is past the 30 day warrenty period so in hindsight I should have put the $ 200 towards a new computer if I was going to wind up spending $ 500 anyway .  
1	  I tried to convert the digital coax optical out from toshiba tv to digital optical in on sound bar . This converter did not work in sending sound from the tv to the sound bar .  
1	  terrible product . frequently drops connection to the router several times a day . not stable at all . really annoying when i 'm surfing the net or downloading files and it looses connection to the router . linksys should be embarrassed to sell such a piece of junk . i thought for the longest time that i was loosing connection / dropping connection because of my linksys wcg200 gateway router only to find out that it is not a wcg200 problem at all but rather a flaky and unstable WUSB54G adapter . and there is absolutely no excuse for the dropping connections since i have no interfering wireless phones , or other wireless devices using the same band , and plus add to the adapter is only about 20 feet away . don't buy this product or you 'll be sorry . I wouldn't even think about selling this junk on ebay to anyone , instead I 'm putting it where it belongs .. in the trash ! I 'm switching to the Hawking HWU8DD wireless adapter . * UPDATE 10/24/2008 - The wireless disconnect problems are still occuring using the Hawking HWU8DD wireless adapter . I believe now that the majority of the problems were caused by my WCG200 gateway and not the wireless NIC . Although I still suspect that this linksys NIC may have caused some more disconnect problems unrelated to the WCG200 .  
2	  Purchased this remote to control a security system where the DVR was in a closet . As CCTV systems do not generally have a code to program universal remote controls the " learn " feature was essential . It worked great . I then started dinking around with other household systems . Shortly thereafter , I had all my TV / AV equipment programmed in and working well . The UHF / IR blaster works great . The remote is solid and well constructed . Made in Korea ( in general much better quality than products coming from China ) . Highly customizable if you 're willing to take the time . Nice instructional CD and well packaged . Now I have one remote to control everything in the house . The Powerblaster unit comes with IR flashers in case the device is not directly in front of the blaster . I didn't need those but it makes for a nice package . Overall this package is a great value and probably worth over twice the purchase price .  
2	  All you need to know is that there is an international mode that allows this device to operate in completely empty frequencies in the 80s . To accomplish this , hold down the " preset " button until the US mode flashes . Change it to international . Then go down to 87.7 or 87.9 and enjoy a clear band . If you have the problem of the international mode power saving bug ( the device shuts off automatically after one minute , no matter what volume you set your audio device to ) , just save the low frequencies to the memory , then switch back to US mode . Your transmitter will say that you are at 107.9FM , but it 's actually at 87.7 or 87.9 , and the power saving bug is not an issue .  
2	  I got this unit about 3 months ago . I paired it with a 42inch LG Scarlet LCD and Asus O ! Play HD2 . I 've set it up in a room that 's 11feet by 16feet . The result is awesome . I use the BOSE for the sound and the O ! Play HD2 for the visuals . The combination just works perfectly . I don't use it as a DVD player since it does have some region limitations . I prefer to use it to pipe out the audio which it does so well . The sound is rich and clear . Dialogues are crisp even at low volume . The bass is perfectly toned at high and low volume . I do a lot of research before I buy . I researched this product and similar ones over 3 weeks before deciding in favour of the bose 321 . It has not let me down . I initially had some problem with the sound disappearing . Took the unit to Bose , they fixed it and handed it back to me in 3 days flat . Turns out I wasn't using the correct power source . Since then I 've selected the correct power source and haven't had any issues at all .  
1	  Same as all the other transmitters I have tried . I think I live in your average city ( Cincinnati , OH ) . But I tested every channel setting in several geographic locations and never did find one that worked satisfactorily . The few stations that came close had too much hiss and / or static to make it useful . Glad others had success , not me .  
1	  The summary for this product says : " Provides wireless connectivity for any USB-enabled computer . " However , when I went to the DLink web site ( $U$ ) and downloaded the instruction manual , I found its system requirements listed as " Windows XP / 2000 " which does not include any of the USB-enabled computers I own . I am fortunate that I didn't go through the trouble of ordering it and waiting for it to arrive , only to have to return it . I wish Amazon would include the actual system requirements for all computer related products in a prominent place .  
2	  After reading in several places that * water * was the best for cleaning your TV , I was reluctant to fork over the money for this kit ( liquid and cloth ) . But let me tell you-it was well worth it ! It is amazing how well it works . Now that I have a two-year old , I get fingerprints , handprints , peanut butter-you name it-on the screen , and this stuff gets it right off like magic . I use it to clean my computer screens too . Unless you are completely obsessive , one bottle should last for a few years .  
1	  Update : I had given our first set five stars , they worked beautifully until the recharger base stopped working . Decided to buy another set - it 's less than 6 months old and this base has stopped working too ! We won't waste money a third time !  
2	  UPDATE - I had to go back and change this review , after owning these headphones for a few more months . The thin , long cords mentioned in other reviews are a HUGE problem . They do get tangled very quickly . Also , because the cord is so long it tends to hang away from your body . This becomes an issue when you are out in public and it can get hung up on things . Mine accidentally got looped around the armrest of a subway seat . When I got up , it ripped the headphones out of my ears and the wires out of their enclosures . I knew this wouldn't be covered under warranty , but I called etymotic to see if I might be able to get a refurbished replacement or some sort of deal . They informed me that I could use their " replacement plan , " which would require me to ship them my headphones ( at my expense ) and then pay $ 100 for a replacement pair ( more than a new pair cost on amazon ) . What a great deal ! I 'm moving on to a pair of Shures . -I have only had the headphones for roughly one month . So far , they have held up well . The wires are quite thin , get tangled easily , and I worry they will eventually give out . The sound quality is much better than standard i-pod headphones , provided you establish a nice " seal " with your ear . My favorite thing so far is how well these headphones block outside noise . They are perfect for studying in a cafe . One downside is that you really wont be able to hear if someone tries to get your attention . Instead of simply turning down your volume , if you want to have even a brief exchange with someone you will have to take them out of your ear . kind of annoying , but not a huge deal .  
2	  This product has exceeded my expectations . It increased my bandwidth from 12mbps to 16mbps and decreased my latency from 200ms to 26ms ( On a 9 year old router , haven't hooked up the new one yet ) . It was also extremely easy to set up .  
1	  OK .. first off , I am comparing these to another set of noise canceling earbuds that I own . I am comparing these to the Audio-Technica ATH ANC3BK ( gen1 ) . But here 's the lowdown .. Bad : Design : They are not very ergonomic and are not comfortableDesign : There is no clip for the very large battery / electronics sectionSound Quality : Horrible . No Bass , no matter how far you can manage to cram them in your earNow the good : Price : They are cheap . Overall : I 'm not going to return them because they were only like $ 17 and I spend more than that on coffee everyday . The sound quality is horrible and they are not comfortable . I only bought these because I was curious if cheaper earbuds were starting to become as good as the more expensive ones like my Audio-Technica ATH ANC3BK . I have come to the conclusion that cheap is still cheap and even though the technology is a rather simple technology , the companies that make the cheaper buds haven't quite figured it out yet . If you like music and if you like canceling annoying noises around you , these buds will disappoint you .  
2	  This is a great GPS device . My only complaint is that it is hard to turn the GPS tracking off . This is only an issue when you are downloading to a computer in a building where you can't get a signal . It is easy to use and gets great accuracy !  
1	  Ok so were to begin . This has got to be the biggest pile of wasted money I have ever spent . I have owned one of these for year now , using very sparingly . I would say I have only printed out about 50 images . Though the scanner works great , the printer itself is unresponsive most of the time , says it is out of paper when it is not , and the ink tray is always getting stuck . My opinion of this item is anyone who buys it after reading this review is just plain dumb . It is well worth the extra 50 bucks to buy something that acctually works . HP has done nothing but dig themselves deeper and deeper into my hate list . PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH HP DEVICES !  
2	  I received the Koss HB60 wireless headphones as a gift . I had put this product on my Amazon " wish list " because it 's the ONLY wireless headphones available that allows the use of personal headphones or ear buds other than those provided by the manufacturer . I never expected the Koss earphones to be any good ( and threw them away after opening the package ) . I didn't care . I only wanted a wireless system that would allow me to use my Bose headphones . This is the only system on the market that can do that . And it works just fine . All the people who rated this product with one or two star are idiots . Who walks into another room with their headphones on while watching TV ? Who uses their computer right next to their wireless receiver while watching a movie ? And any negative comments about range are just argumentative . I sit about 15 feet from my TV and have had no reception problems . Admittedly , I do experience a little bit of background hiss . But it is easily managed with proper volume settings . For the lowest hiss , set the Koss receiver volume as low as possible and adjust your listening volume with your TV remote . With the right settings , what little hiss there is never bothers me . This unit was easy to set up and worked great right out of the box ( after battery installation ) . I have watched several movies so far on the first set of batteries and it 's still going strong . If there is a negative , it is that battery installation in the receiver unit is sort of a pain . The belt clip on the receiver makes it hard to insert the most recessed of the two AA batteries . But once it 's in , the other battery clicks in easily . Since I don't wear the receiver as a clip-on device , I may just remove ( or break off ) the clip since it 's worthless to me . If you want a wireless headphone system for your TV but you prefer to use your own personal headphones or ear buds , this is the only system I know of that can meet your needs and it works just fine .  
1	  They can't support this properly - beware . A simple question on how to connect this wirelessly they can't provide help . They then actually had the nerve to tell me to seek support from the retailer ! Beware .  
1	  We bought the 30GB video iPod last Christmas ( 05 ) and on day 100 ( 10 days out of warrenty ) the screen spontaneously cracked from the inside , without being dropped or mishandled . It literally went into the pocket OK and came out a few minutes later broken ! Again , there was nothing that should have caused it to break ! And , there is no exterior damage or scratching whatever . From reading posts at Apple and elsewhere , it is very common with this model . Beware ! We took it to the local Apple store in Tampa and fortunately in our case it was declared caused by an internal " thermal " problem that cracked the inside glass layer . The tell-tale sign were large " ink spot " looking marks on the screen , being only cracked inside-the outer plastic layer was perfect , and absolutely not external damage evident . Got a new iPod . Apple didn't quibble about being a little past the 90 days .. and now we have 180 days from the orginal purchase . A great prduct but two stars because of the self-destructive nature of the video iPod 's ( like the Nano before ) screen .  
2	  Just the right length and gauge for my 15'X15 ' setup . Easy to strip and hook-up , speakers sound great . The packaging smelled like gasoline .. but who cares , it 's speaker wire .  
2	  I was so mad at myself when i scratched the face of my iphone with my engagement ring . It was a pretty deep scratch that was about 1/3 of an inch wide . I thought I would never get it out ! I searched online for ipod scratch remover and found idrops , I thought I would give it a try but had no big expectations . I started with an old cotton shirt and followed the directions exactly . After an hour , I started seeing some results but my thumb was starting to blister - then I switched to Q-tips . Best idea ever ! After about another 60 minutes ( and a few dozen Q-tips ) the scratch was just about gone . I worked on it a little bit over the next few days with Q-tips and the scratch is now gone ! My boyfriend thought I got a new phone ! It took a lot of work , and a lot of Q-tips - but my idrops purchase was well worth it !  
1	  First thing I did with this remote is to try to control my XBox 360 . Out of the package , this remote runs VERY slowly on the XBox 360 . You press a button , the control lights up , and then about a half second later the command registers with the XBox . . . As you press the buttons , your commands also seem to queue up . So you hit the button a few times while its waiting to register for the first command , it then does your repeat presses in the order you hit them . But wait , you can change the timings ! Everyone and their mother is telling me to change the timings but of course , timings are set to their minimum for the XBox . Then someone told me on the logitech forums that I have to aim it better . . . this is a remote control . I shouldnt have to do anything other than point in the basic direction . These people want me to install a lazer sight on the damned thing . The TV setup was somewhat of a pain . I had to erase my entire configuration in order to use it . Then when I set up the TV and Cable activities , it seemed to create all its own inputs with the default names . I don't like that at all . . . it should be able to use the inputs that I define so my wife who won't use this control doesn't have to memorize that the DTV input is cable and Component 1 is DVD . Next , I can't just power on and off the TV . I have to hit some other button that is asking what activity I 'd like to use first . When I do this , it makes sure all of inputs are correct . So because of this , it takes like 7 seconds for my TV to turn on when I tell it to use the " Watch TV " activity . I can't figure out how to tell it that these inputs that it is checking won't change . . . Not to mention that when I did this , it seems to blip inputs and add a space to a movie I 'm recording because inputs from the cable box were set in the process . All I want to do is hit the power button . - Buttons : First , there are missing buttons . Where is the " List " or " On Demand " button ? Where is the sleep button ? PIP buttons ? There are more but you get the picture . Page up / down ? Guide ( Guide and Live were an afterthought thrown as words on the buttons you might use for the A / B / C buttons . They don't even work as guide and Live until you program them if you want to ) . How about the A B C buttons that have been on every cable remote that I 've seen in the past 8 years ? For buttons that don't exist , you can put them into the 4 buttons with paging on the LCD screen . That 's nice , but should I have to page over for buttons ? Luckily I was able to fit my buttons on unused things such as sleep on Star . The Live button also didn't work out of the box but I was able to fix it . The configuration utility is pretty confusing at first but it was doable . There are typos but I assume that is the mistake of the TV manufacturer . The LCD is a nice feature but it needs more buttons . - Timing : Ugh . . . why do I care about timing ? WHY ? Why can the manufacturer not provide the timing ? Setting timings is what you have to do when your remote responds too slowly for your items . Unfortunately , Im stuck with a slow XBox remote . . . this is ridiculous but true . My TV Volume control was too slow at first but I lowered the timings and it works fine . . . My settings were arbitrary and they worked . Guess I can't complain about more than having to set them in the first place . - Software : The software does not provide much info . For instance . When I go to timings and I see the " Start Time " or whatever it is . . . I want to know what that means . Most people think mousing over something like that should tell me but apparently not the people at logitech . I still don't know what it means though I did finally find a way to get the manual which does not come with the remote ( this is a good idea though because I dont like all the paper wasted on manuals ) . - For the money , Im not sure I 'd buy this remote . I got it as a gift and I did want it but after seeing some of the things about it , I kinda wish I just waited on this and bought something a little more sophisticated and comprehensive . For those who don't know , you can use ANY harmony remote for the XBox 360 . You don't need this thing . There might be more about this but I didn't even finish setting up the system . It took me a few hours to get just my TV set up with all the buttons and timings I want . I had to finally go to sleep . Luckily my sleep key worked . I was happy about that .  
2	  The exilim series is a GOOD one from casio . It 's best feature is it 's weight and size IF that 's important to you - it is to me in this case . If you need more weight in a camera to feel comfortable , this may not be for you . The pix are as good as most cameras that size , the sexy black is a show stopper , but 10 pixels ? How much is too much ? You won't be disappointed with this camera .  
1	  Well , it wasn't what I ordered . The listing states it is a DS Light TRAVEL Battery Charger . This is just a regular charger . The key word is TRAVEL , which means it adjusts the voltage , as described in the listing , for international TRAVEL . This is only a standard US charger . I wish sellers would read the listings before offering to sell their items . It is what we do as customers . I don't think it asking too much that they sell what they are listing .  
1	  Only analog cables can possibly make any difference to the signal . Digital cables either transmit the bits or not . Monster would like you to think that the cool-looking connectors are worth $ 170 , but as long as they don't fall off , this cable will be equivalent to a $ 17 hdmi cable , of which you can buy 5 , just in case , and keep half of your money in your pocket .  
2	  Bought the K100D Super to use with my Pentax lenses from a ZX-30 35mm camera ( also a great camera ) . After about a month of use , I am very happy so far . Huge difference in image quality and flexibility over my old HP Photosmart 730 . Color and shapness are great and LCD screen is easy to see , even in sunlight . Have used a 300mm zoom and 2x converter on wildlife and pics are excellent . Would give it 5 stars , except I have only had it a month . Andy  
1	  This item arrived defective . We 've tried it in three devices-two very new cell phones and a digital camera . It locks the devices up . Amazon will not work with you to exchange this item unless you return it within 30 days . Avoid this very poorly made item , or buy it from a retailer with a better return policy ( Costco comes to mind ) .  
2	  I liked the layout of the remote and bright screen , but had trouble setting it up with Logitech / Harmony web site .  
2	  I have only burned four so far but none have failed . Printing to the hub has worked effectively . I would prefer a glossier printing surface for printing photos , though .  
1	  I 've been using this remote for about a year and a half now . It has some great features that I can't live without , however the craftsmanship and ergonomics of this thing really ruin it for me . First , the good .. I love how this Harmony switches on and off multiple devices with the press of a single button . That feature is the bread and butter of this remote and it 's great . Instead of wading through the inputs menu of multiple devices on multiple remotes , I press one button and the remote takes care of it all . If a command is missed by a device , for whatever reason , the " help " button almost always fixes the problem with one press . I would rate this remote a 3 or 4 because of these features if not for the shabby build quality . The first remote I had for about year before it needed to be replaced . The charging dock stopped charging the remote . I contacted Logitech 's technical support and without any hassle , they sent me a brand new remote . I 'd rate Logitech 's tech support A + , but I am not reviewing their service , I 'm reviewing this remote . I 've been using the second remote for 6 months now . I press the volume up button and it turns the volume down . It 's broken .. 0 for 2As these remotes broke on me I became more critical of the design . I realized I disliked the screen . I bought the remote because of the screen and now I hated it . It is a novel idea but it takes up way too much button pushing real-estate . Besides hitting it once to turn things on I rarely use it , and because of it , buttons that I use often are all tiny and scrunched at the bottom . Besides the size of the buttons the design and layout of them also leaves a lot to be desired . All of the function buttons are almost exactly the same size and there is not any tactile differences between them . This leads to lots of miss-presses . Also , the number pad is extremely low on the remote which makes using it without two hands very unbalanced and uncomfortable . I was hoping this remote would be the end-all , be-all remote . Unfortunately , it was not for me . My next remote needs to have the single button for multiple - devices feature , like this one , but it also needs big and chunky buttons , and a more ergonomic design .  
1	  D-Link router sort of worked for awhile ; I would have to reset it once a week or more , then finally quit altogether . Tech support doesnt exist and boy you better not lose your receipt if you 'd like them to tell you even the time of day .  
1	  This product is a cheap cheap cheap cheap run of the mill product . Yea it looks cool , all digital like but really when u get it is all plastic like and the cassette player eats tapes , at least it ate my tape and the head phones are chincy and don't work and u can only get sound in one ear and they are really bad . and i would not reccomend buying this product , i would go for sumthing better .  
2	  I have just started using this keyboard a few days ago so can't speak for durability . The extra hand rest is optional , and does need to be attached ( if space does not permit ) . This keyboard is not very quiet , just average on sound levels . There are 3 light options ( blue , red , purple ) and you can adjust the brightness of each , which is nice . Overall , it 's a good keyboard , serves the purpose , and works fine . I would buy it again if I had to .  
2	  It looks good . It sounds good . It has decent low end . It does NOT charge a 2nd gen iPod Touch .  
2	  Many rollers today are very wide and cumbersome , but not this bag . It is taller than the average roller therefore making it skinner . It fits on the floor-board , in the backseat of a car . I especially like the top-entry design for laptop loading versus a side entrance . THe front panel is large and very organized . I am very happy with my purchase . The reason for 4 versus 5 stars is that one of the wheels gets stuck while rolling - not too smooth , but it corrects itself without you having to touch the dirty wheels .  
2	  I bought this battery to replace the original batter in my UPS and it is working as expected after sufficient charging .  
1	  BUYER BE WHERE , I BOUGHT THIS MACHINE AND WORKED FOR THREE DAYS TRYING TO GIVE IT A FAIR SHAKE TO WORK .. I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE MISSING SOMETHING SO I TOOK IT TO A FRIEND WHO IS A COMPUTER ENGINEER , THINKING MAYBE I DIDN'T GET IT .. HE WORKED ON THE THING ONE ENTIRE EVENING AND SAID THAT IT DOSEN'T WORK , WE CALLED THE PHILLUPS HOT LINE WHOS ONLY ADVISE WAS TO TURN THE THING OFF LET IT SI FOR ONE HOUR AND TRY AGAIN , I DID IT ANYWAY TO SAY I TRIED IT ALL .. THANK GOODNESS I BOUGHT THIS AT A REPUTABLE DEALER WHO THE TOOK IT BACK AND THE SALESPERSON GOT ME ANOTHER CDR775 BY PHILLUPS . WE OPENED THE NEW BOX . PLUGGED IT IN AND WASTED 5 MORE CD BLANKS TRYING TO MAKE THIS WORK .. IT WOULDN'T FINALIZE .. NOR WOULD IT COMPLETELY RECORD A WHOLE DISC , NOR WOULD IT PLAY ANY PART OF IT . I RETURNED THE SECOND AND I AM NOW REVIEWING YOUR WEB SITE TO BUY ONE THAT WORKS .. BE CAREFUL ..  
1	  I also have problems with the paint coming off the case . Also , the case is really intended for the Zire 21 , where the power cable and the USB connection are off the top edge of the PDA : The case hinges at the top , flipping open like a Star Trek communicator , so access to these ports is easy . This is NOT for the Zire 31 : Palm added a Secure Digital card slot and a headphone socket to the 31 , and there apparently was not enough room for the power and USB connector as well , not to mention the infared sensor , on the top edge . On the 31 , power and USB are imbedded along the left edge , and there 's a white rubber cover attached to the case to cover those holes when they 're not in use . The PDA is attached to the case by applying adhesive velcro strips to the case and PDA , and the sides of the case are too high when the case is open to permit plugging these into the PDA without physically pulling the PDA partially off the velcro . Still looking for some protection for a really good PDA .  
1	  Bought this to go with my Zire 31 . The case fits well - although the cover itself is just a flap - no closure . For carrying around in an outside pocket on my purse its ok . If it were just another piece of floatsam in my suitcase of a purse , I can't imagine it would do much good . Its a little difficult to get the stylus out of the back when the Zire is in the case , but not impossible . The stylus is cool - a blackpen , an orange pen , a pencil and stylus all in one . It took me a few minutes to figure out exactly how to switch from one to another - but I managed . The screen protectors are ok - nothing spectacular . Don't follow the lines printed on the screen cover when you trim them to fit your PDA - the lines for my Zire 31 are a bit small . All in all , this is ok - but I think next time I will try to find a better case . I would advise any PDA noobs to buy the PDA , take it with you to a store that sells cases and pick one out from there .  
2	  I am fifteen and I do a lot of traveling around the country . I thought it would be fun to take around a camera that was sturdy and not too expensive to record all the interesting and fun things that happen when I travel . I decided to try this product out and I love it ! It doesn't have much memory on its own , so I bought a 128 MB memory card for $ 13.00 , which holds over 200 pictures at a time and over 2 hours of video memory . That 's enough for me . You can get memory cards for a good price that hold twice that , too . The picture is also pretty sharp . The camera doesn't have a flash , though . With a normal houselight the picture usually is a bit yellowish , but not too much . The pictures are great outdoors . The only downside that really bothers me is the fact that it eats up the batteries so quickly , and the batteries are not rechargeable .. just normal AA batteries . So I will have to keep a pack of extra batteries in my purse , just in case . I read that some people don't like how small the LCD screen is , but I think it 's just fine . It 's enough to see what you 're filming and it 's really sharp so it gets details well . I wouldn't get this camera if it was going to be the family camera . I think it 's more just for personal , everyday use . When you upload the movies to the computer , they are in WMA format , which works with Windows Movie Maker and is easy to upload onto the net . Overall , I think this is a great , handy , well-built camera for an awesome price !  
1	  I have been an HP printer fan for 15 + years , both personally and professionally . Because my company has an HP standard printer selection , the 5650 was my only choice to replace an older HP 895CXI , which by the way , I LOVED . My initial 5650 had to be replaced as the IT folks experienced quality problems at setup . This 5650 is less than 4 months old , yet jams OFTEN , makes clunking noises , and I suspect it won't last but another few months , if I 'm lucky . I am so disappointed in HP over this printer , that I recently purchased 2 new printers for my home , both replacing old HP 800 series , and I purchased 2 Canons . Both have been working like a charm for 3 months . Wake up HP - especially if you 're making deals with corporations on low end models . We 're the professionals who leave the corporate world and equipment and make purchases for our homes .  
1	  I 'm normally a big fan of microsoft ergo keyboards , and have always prefered ergo over a standard keyboard . However , after a few days of using this newly redesigned keyboard , I was extremely disappointed and had to exchange it for a standard logitech keyboard . First , this keyboard is very large . This really isn't a problem . However , the tiny plastic feet that support the back of the keyboard can barely support it 's weight . Any pressure on these feet will cause them to bend or break . Once looking at them , you 'll easily see why . Second , it looks like Microsoft decided that since the keyboard was split and that they had extra room , they would change the size of a few lettered keys towards the middle so they are twice the size of a normal key ! Add this to the fact that the keys feel " squishy " and you 've got one crazy typing experience . It certainly does not feel natural at all . I really did try to get use to this , but I kept finding myself pressing incorrect keys , or having to look at the keyboard to make sure I hit the right key . The large hot keys at the top of the keyboard are a nice touch . But for media playback , it has a Play / Pause button , and that 's it . No next , forward , back , or even a stop button . For no apparent reason , they are simply nowhere to be found . Now , it does feel comfortable ( even though you can barely type at half your normal typing speed ) , and it looks great . And that 's where the compliments end . I even had 2 other friends try out the keyboard , and they agreed .. it 's just not natural . Pros : - It looks great in black / silver - Comfortable to rest your hands on the keyboard - Keyboard has a good solid feel ( excluding feet ) . Cons : - The tiny plastic feet are useless - Some letters on keyboard are larger than others ( annoying ) - Keys feel way too soft and offer no feedback - Missing extra media controlsWhile this keyboard may be " comfortable " and looks nice , it 's just not practical for daily use if the feet break , the keys feel strange , and it slows down your typing experience . I 'd suggest going with an older microsoft ergo keyboard or sticking with a standard keyboard .  
1	  My mother and I both bought brand new iTrips , and within two months , both were broken ( mine broke within weeks ) . The iTrips have no warranty and break very easily . Sound quality is decent at best ; expect random interference , and the weak signal crumbles at higher volume . If you are considering an FM transmitter for your car , casette decks are much less expensive and have far better sound quality than even the best FM transmitters . I strongly suggest you give this particular transmitter a miss .  
1	  Believe the bad reviews and poor experiences . I bought a Zune , had absolutely no luck in getting it to work , returned it , bought an iPod . Happiness returned , Zune returned , life is good !  
2	  First off , nice CD player . A lot of reviews had some things wrong in them .. Battery life : 15 hours MP3 cds , 7-9 regular cds Shock protection : 120 sec for mp3 's , however , to save batteries , the buffer fills up and then the disc stops spinning , and when the buffer gets low , it spins the disc up again . Therefore , there is little skip protection at the beginning of the song . And yes , this is not a joggable cd player . 40 sec or 10 sec ( switchable ) for regular cds . And hello people ! FIRMWARE ! YAAY ! And the firmware is the best so far . P>Overall , a very good cd player . Oh , the headphones " . Buy some good Koss ones .  
1	  Lens describe small scratch but when i received it scratch was so deep on the front of the lens , and when you shoot on the bright area you can see the scratch from the lens .  
2	  I must say this product is awsome . I havent tried any other adapter from another brand but this one gets the job done pefectly . I first tried it in my girlfriends Accord and it was great , now I use it on my Acura RSX and it tunes beutifully with Bose audio system . I recommend this product to everyone .  
2	  These headphones are a great deal ! The bass is incredibly clear , and the winding case is extremely convenient .  
1	  Just bought this scanner paid $ 174.00 for it because it was " pre-programed " thinking it would be race ready , over the refurbished unit of $ 129.00 which clearly advises it is not " pre-programed " . The programing in this item is OUT OF DATE it still has Dale Jarret racing in the # 88 car and he has been retired at least two years . So I paid $ 45.00 more for this item and if I can't figure out how to program it myself I will have to spend at least $ 25.00 to have it programed . SO as I see it I spent $ 45 to $ 70 dollars more than if I bought the REFURBISHED unit as I have to program my " pre-programed " anyway . I should have just bit the bullet and bought it at the track as it would have been " race-ready " . It is a great unit sharp looking appears to be well built . I give rave reviews for this scanner but SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE REFURBISHED MODEL .  
1	  Just as some other reviewers said , these are way too tight . There is no way to adjust them not to be tight . The coil will pull your computer before it stretches , and I am afraid to pre-stretch for fear of it snapping because it is so stiff . The volume control is just awful . There is a switch on each ear and turning the volume down on one side will move that volume to the other ear , rather than actually turning it down in both ears . To turn down the volume , you have to turn both knobs simultaneously . Finally , I get fuzzy sounds sometimes depending on how I turn the headphones after first use , which will only exacerbate as time goes on . Final review : Not recommended .  
1	  As others have pointed out , the WAN side of this linksys box constantly crashes . If you do not host servers inside the firewall and don't need VPN , then this works OK . But there are products that can do what you need for half the price . If you host servers , be ready for constant disconnects : this linksys is a time wasting piece of junk . In addition to constant WAN crashes , you 'll also have to deal with documented bugs that linksys refuses to fix .  
2	  Easy to set-up and operation was flawless . Would recommend it to anyone who wanted a quality scanner without breaking the bank .  
2	  I have half a dozen computers in my office and have tried out ( and spent a lot of money on ) a variety of KVM solutions . This device , which I 've used for several months now to control four computers , is my favorite ; let me tell you why . - I prefer to use a wireless keyboard , and I 've found that " hotkey " KVMs have real problems with some wireless keyboard , often requiring multiple attempts to get it to register . - I 'm a fast touch-typist , yet I don't find " ScrollLock-ScrollLock -< # > " or " Ctrl-Alt -< # > " to be any faster or more convenient than simply reaching over to punch a button . Your mileage may vary . - Video switching speed is a lot faster than , say , the Belkin KVM + audio ( F1DL102P ) I 'm using right now for two of my computers . The Belkin also causes a audible ' pop ' on my speakers each time I switch . - The extra USB ports have made it easy to share USB devices among the four computers hooked up to the IOGEAR . The only ( momentary ) problem that I 've ever encountered with this IOGEAR KVM is when I switched to a Gyration wireless keyboard + mouse . The Gyration wireless receiver has a single USB connector instead of a PS / 2 pair , and plugging that into either of the IOGEAR 's front USB ports ( keyboard or mouse ) didn't work . However , I quickly discovered that plugging it into one of the IOGEAR 's general USB ports in back worked just fine and actually has a benefit : when I run down the rechargeable batteries in the Gyration mouse , I just put that mouse back in its cradle and plug a USB mouse into the IOGEAR 's front USB mouse port and keep working . In short , I like this a lot . In fact , I came here to Amazon tonight to see if there was a two-connector version , so I can replace the Belkin . Turns out there is , and I 'm ordering it . But I thought I 'd write this review first . .. bruce ..  
1	  The Rio 600 , on the outside , is very appealing and seems easy to use . However , it is , in truth , unreliable and cheap . The Rio 600 simply does not work . For Christmas , I received a Rio 600 . It worked beautifully for an hour or so , but then suddenly the sound stopped working . It was not the headphones , I tried another pair . Therefore , I returned it , thinking it was just a faulty player . I ordered and soon received my second Rio 600 . That too appeared to be working just fine . Disappointingly , when I tried to download some songs it simply would not work . Also , the MP3 player indicated that some memory was being used although there were no songs on the player . I ignored this , thinking that perhaps it was supposed to do that , and then tried to download a few songs onto the player . It simply would not work . The software on the computer showed that the MP3 player was downloading the music , but the MP3 player itself was not . These are only a few among many problems that I encountered with the Rio 600 software , alone . Obviously there are a few bugs that need to be worked out before the Rio 600 should be on the market . I see that the intent of the Rio 600 is good , but the actual product is not . I do not understand how the makers could not have noticed all of the problems with the Rio 600 . Truthfully , the Rio 600 is not all bad . The sound quality is wonderful and I adore the headphone style . Also , it is incredibly easy to use ( when it is working correctly ) . However , I would not recommend this product and I strongly discourage you from purchasing it . It seems that I am not the only one who has had problems with the Rio 600 . A few friends of mine have also bought the Rio 600 and they too have had many problems with it . In short , the Rio 600 is more trouble than it is worth .  
2	  Ok , so I was skeptical to say the least , but I have to tell you that this little gadget is by far the easiest , quickest way to make some really good popcorn . My wife and I have been having popcorn pretty much every night since we received it last week . I guess every microwave oven is different , but for us , it takes 1:30 to get the whole thing popped to perfection , though there are like 10 kernels left unpopped , I have found that if I leave it for longer than that , some of the popcorn tends to taste burned or something which is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 . As for the little disks that are needed , we have used 2 so far . The first one I used various combinations of oil , water ( to get the salt to stick ) hot sauce and what not and that disck only lasted like 8 uses , but the other disk has easily been used 15 or so times , and even though it looks dirty , its still working so results will vary . Overall though , a very , very wise choice .  
1	  I 'm on my 3rd day with the Riot . It quit the second morning ; locked up solid . The power switch wouldn't turn it off . Thishappened after trying to play different tracks . It only had5 albums on it ! I left it to run down the battery , but thatdidn't help . Still locked solid . I was able to reset it with a paper clip in the reset hole onthe back . I then took Rio 's advice to delete the bad tracks ( why bad , I don't know - they 're fine on the PC ) . However , that is hard to do , since after the player flags a track asunplayable , it removes it from the playlist so you can't findout what it was . Plus , you have to navigate to other menusto do the deleting . I ended up wiping the unit , so I canstart over . But , I forgot the very special USB cable , so Icouldn't do it at work today . One more try at this , and then I 'm going to give up . Rightnow I don't think this product was ready for release . I 'll give some of my likes and dislikes , aside from thefact that it doesn't work ! Also , this is based on verylittle actual time with the unit operating . Good points :* size isn't really an issue for me . It 's big , but OK . * user interface seems OK , but I only had two hours ! Down side :* the backlight can only be set to be fully off , or to beon for a period of time after you press any button . BUT , when I have it set , and I press a button , the whole displaybecomes unreadable to me while the light is on . Didn'ttry it in the dark . I think this is going to be useless , or worse . * they have lots of warnings about not sticking the powerplug in the headphone hole . They are about one / half inchapart , and similar . Is this bad design or what ? I keep buying new products , and always say that you shouldwait until the bugs get worked out . That definitely seemsto be the case here .  
2	  I have tried them all and when I stumbled upon the review of these Coby 's ( that was my first reservation - who 's heard of this name brand ) I thought what the heck I can part with 6 bucks to give em a try . Long story short Im getting rid of all my other headphones - sonys , phillips etc . and ordering five more pair for my computer , portable dvd , mp3 . These are nothing short of magnificent - The more I listen to these the more I just laugh because for the price they feel and sounds like some ultra expensive headphone that some rich guy subsidized and slapped a generic name on just to get some kicks - I will never use another headphone again .  
1	  Less than two years ago , I bought an Orion / Sansui TV . Less than a year later , it blew up . Was under warrantee , so they had to pay for it 's repair . The digital board was shot among other things . Now less than a year after that , it blew up again . Called Orion assuming that the replacement parts from less than a year ago would also be under the same 1 year warrantee , but was shocked to discover they only put a 90 day warrantee on their replacement parts . So I told the lady very nicely that she could at least pay the $ 35 to have my set looked at by the repair shop and she wouldn't do it . So I told her they were gonna lose one way or the other . I obviously bought a lemon , and they wouldn't stand behind their product , nor their parts . I told her she could help me out , or with my remaining 30 or 40 years on this planet I would tell everyone I know to NOT BUY ANY ELECTRONICS FROM ORION . I assured her that I would be certain to persuade enough people to not buy their product that they would be worse off than standing behind their product now . She chose this route : DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ORION . IT IS JUNK , and they will NOT stand behind their product .  
1	  I bought my handheld about a year ago . It was a trial run to see if I would like the idea . I did ! But . . . after just 8 months of owning it , I could not tap the screen . I had to email the company to find out how to fix it . Their solution was to do a soft reset once a week . Two months later I decided I wanted to enter data via the PC and print a calendar for my husband . The connection was bad everytime , it was the software . The software was in working order when I first bought it . For my time and effort it was not worth it . I am planning on buying another handheld but will invest more money and do a bit more research ..  
1	  My mouse is jerky and simply freezes from time to time . The keyboard is out of control giving me multiple key strokes instead of just one . Some times it just stops working , and you have to unplug everything to get it reset again . In stead of saving effort and time I have extra work to pull everything out and unplug it from the computer before I can reset it .  
1	  I tried the iTrip with different frequencies the result was consistant - Low quality sound and too much noise disturbance . I am returning the product .  
2	  These are great , they produce good base and for the average user they will appreciate the mids and highs . These are not $ 500 earbuds and should not be compared to them . If you are looking for some good work out earbuds these are great .  
2	  Adding RAM is just about as easy as falling out of bed and a lot less painful . Rather than invest in a new computer I upgraded to over 1 gig of RAM and I 'm now set for the forseeable future . It took all of 8 minutes , start to finish , to install and get back up to speed .  
1	  I recently received my Coby player and found some things that were not very well thought out in the overall design . Here are the Pro 's and cons that I found . Cons : 1 . DVD load mechanism . This is a significant flaw as it does not allow you to easily load a DVD when vehicle mounted . The mechanism requires that you remove it from the holder , open it up , put in the DVD , close it then re-insert it into the holder . Very poor design that is a royal pain to change DVDs if the car is moving . 2 . Manual AV / DVD switch . On the left side of the unit is the sliding switch which turns on the player to one of two modes , DVD or AV . The manufacturer should have gone with an electronic switch vice a manual switch as it is not easy to ensure you have the DVD mode since it is in the center of the selection slide and there is no audible or ' feelable ' indication that you have it in the correct position . This becomes more inconvenient when you are sliding the player in or out of the holder . Pros . 1 . Good picture quality . The picture is clear and easy to see . 2 . Sound control easy to use . Spinning wheel sound control is easy to adjust . 3 . Compact slim design . Overall design is especially well suited for vehicle mounting and allows the player to sit flat against the back of the headrest . This keeps it from being kicked or jostled if you have a toddler in a car seat . The fold out one I had was prone to being kicked by my 3 year old . Overall the player is a good buy for the money but I couldn't rate it higher as the two design flaws are significant in detracting from its ease of use .  
2	  Included all hardware and easy to understand instructions . Excellent fix for the problem that it was designed to address . It 's a shame that they don't tell you that you may need this adapter when you purchase the wall mount . I found out only after some investigation .  
1	  Badly underpowered host based system .. This printer just looks mighty from the outside . The reality is that it has a host based architecture meaning that it relies on your PC for almost all image processing needs . Even the memory amount 64MB which might seem impressive for an average nave buyer in reality is useless because the image rasterizing is done in your PC and not in the printer . One typical consequence of this poor architecture is that it can NOT process multi-page PDFs with heavy graphics . The spooling process will attempt to create huge spool files into 2-3GB size but eventually will fail with error being printed out or the printer will simply fail the print job by printing only part of the page and then stop . HP has acknowledged this problem and admitted that only starting with the 4600 series the architecture is different and capable of handling graphics and multi-page image files . The printer has a decent output quality and is fast if you need to print multiple copies of the same page . The real toner capacity is ~ ~ 1400-1600 pages for printouts involving colourful images and graphics . For comparison Lexmark C510 easily handles the same PDF files without any glitches . The problem with C510 is that it CAN NOT print on a glossy paper . Attempting to do so leads to a mess with black toner falling off the printouts and getting inside the printer and soiling other pages . This pattern is consistent and happens even with replacement printers despite of Lexmark 's customer service assurances . Also , they have hiked their toner prices to astronomical levels .  
2	  Doesnt have much base but for the size and what I paid for the product you cant beat the quality .  
1	  I bought these to use in our bedroom so I could watch TV without disturbing my wife . When I installed them , the volume of the TV had to be up to hear over the headphones . The description said you could use the headphones so you wouldn't disturb others so I assumed they would work for me . I have returned them .  
2	  Works well for the purpose of printing photos as advertised . Happy with the product , even more happy with the cost ..  
2	  THIS CAMERA IS GREAT , TAKES A LITTLE BIT TO FIGURE OUT ALL THE SETTINGS , GREAT PICTURES  
1	  I now have two terastations sitting on the shelf collecting dust . I bought the terastation live 2tb because of the attractive price . I placed the NAS on a 1 gigabit network with a few macs for clients . I reviewed the manuals and the admin interface and optimized for the mac environment as instructed . The resulting , optimized , file transfer speeds were so slow as to be unworkable for anything other than late night backups . After a few days I purchased a readynas ( also through amazon ) and have found this to be a * much * faster system . Definitely consider this issue before you buy .  
1	  We ordered this DVD player for two reasons : the trust we had in Toshiba products ( we own some others ) and the great online price . The first night after installation it seemed to work fine . The next morning it played the kid ? s DVD ? no problem . But the following night the Toshiba ? s performance took a nosedive ! The remote control became non-responsive . How can you watch TV in bed without a remote ? We gave it a second chance and tried to use to the buttons on the front control panel . They stopped working , too ! THEN the carousel made a loud , ugly noise and began functioning intermittently . The machine struggled to play regular CD 's , which was very disappointing since we also own a 3-year-old inexpensive model DVD player that plays CD ? s flawlessly . Only 24 hours after installation we packed it up to return it ! We won ? t give up on Toshiba products completely because of this experience , but we will be more cautious with the next purchase .  
2	  The Vector 985 is one of the 3 best detectors available and also happens to be the least expensive . It 's got excellent range and can pick up signals from weird locations . I 've gotten GENUINE K and Ka readings coming from below a mountain road and downhill behind a subdivision surrounded by houses , trees , etc .. I actually slapped on my old Cobra ESD9200 next to the Vector 985 just to test them out . The Cobra was dead silent UNTIL I was literally in front of police radar . The Vector 985 had been going nuts 1-2 miles from the radar source .  
2	  You get a grand total of 3 ( yes , three ) power adapters that convert from a US plug to foreign ( but not the other way around ) : PWR110 ( EurAsia , apparently not grounded ) , PWR-104 ( UK , grounded ) , and PWR106 ( Europe , grounded ) . Apparently , these connectors work in about a hundred nations across Europe , Asia-Pacific , Africa / Middle East , and S. America . You could spend the same amount of money buying the 3 adaptors individually , but then you wouldn't get this vast array of exotic and arcane phone adaptors . There 's not much use for phone adapters anymore , between ubiquitous wireless service and access to high-speed internet . But maybe your grandchildren can donate the set to the Smithsonian someday . And it boggles the mind to see the variety of creative configurations for making a small number of copper wires connect inside a plastic junction . Some of the phone adapters have more robust metal connections than the AC adaptors .. you 'd think they were carrying 20 amps at 220 Volts . Another bonus : the plastic case may be just the right size for carrying around your old 33 1/3 rpm records , once you wear out the connectors from constant heavy use . Note that there is no voltage conversion going on here .. your 110V device can still get fried if you plug it into a 220V outlet even with the right adapter . Anyway , the price was fine , the connectors are fine , but take note that there are only 3 pieces out of this vast collection of junk that you 're ever likely to need .  
1	  DO NOT BUY . It did not work with my Microsoft SideWinder Precision Pro . It was never recognized by Windows XP . Even though I tried every suggestion by other users , it proved useless .  
2	  This is one terrific lens ! It solves the problem of wide-angle coverage in the 1.6 FOVCF very nicely . As others have pointed out , the mechanical build and optical quality ( with 3 Aspherical elements and 1 Super-UD ) probably deserve an " L " stamp and a red ring . This lens appears to be of almost identical build , quality and size as the EF 17-40mm f / 4.0 L USM . Even uses the same 77mm filter size as most of the L 's . Overall sharpness is excellent , with maybe a little softness towards the corners at 10mm , but I 've seen comparisons with other ultra-wide zooms like the Sigma and the Canon blows them away ! CA is well controlled too . There is slight Barrel and Pincushion distortions present at the low and high ends , but less than would be expected for a lens this wide . All in all this is one of the best wide-angle zooms available . The major criticism of this lens usually comes down to ; " well , how long will Canon continue to make 1.6 FOVCF cameras ? " or " Someday I might upgrade to a Full Frame camera , then what will I do with this lens ? " I doubt very seriously that Canon will do away with the APS-C cameras any time soon . My reasoning is that : 1 . Canon just came out with the Full Frame 5D at the $ 3000 price point . Introducing a FF camera to replace the 20D at $ 1500 would kill the 5D after only a few months . 2 . Having the EF-S lens line already established almost guarantees keeping the 1.6 format - mostly because of this lens . To be able to use the EF-S 10-22mm , a chip can't really go any bigger than 1.6 since this seems to be the limit of the useable coverage . Using a 1.5 or 1.4 sensor for example would probably start to introduce significant fall-off at the corners of the larger chip . As I am writing this , the PMA conference is only four days away . My prediction is that Canon will announce a replacement for the 20D that will , in essence be a 1.6 FOVCF version of the 5D . They will probably increase the ( already excellent ) density of the 20D 's CMOS by shrinking pixel size down to around 5 micron yielding something around the 10 mega-pixel range to compete with the Nikon D200 . Maybe they will call the camera the 50D after the 5D since they can't really use the name 30D because D30 was already used . In any case , my point is that the 1.6 APS-C format will likely be around for some time to come , until the point where the FF price point drops enough to warrant discontinuing the xxD line . Even then , when that happens , doesn't mean you 'll throw your 20D in the trash ! You 'll still want to keep using it and / or sell it , and having this lens will significantly increase its usefulness or resale value . Now , having said all that , this is the only EF-S lens I plan on buying . From the reviews I 've read , the other EF-S lenses are of significantly lesser quality , and all of your other lens needs can be met with standard EF lenses anyway , APS-C or otherwise . Plus you get the option to buy L glass . So , bottom line is buying this particular EF-S lens for a 20D or XT is a no-brainer . It 's the best solution for wide angle in this format . Hesitating to buy it because " I might get a FF camera someday " is also nonsensical . What I might do in the future is just that , for the future . Not buying a mid-priced car today because " someday " I might buy a Ferrari doesn't satisfy my use and enjoyment of the car today !  
1	  This camera has a problem that might not show up for awhile . In my case it revealed itself after a year and two month . One day fingerprint like lines appeared on prints . They are invisible on LCD monitor but cover the picture area on the computer monitor and on prints . Search the Internet and you will find many similar complaints .  
2	  This case is well built and handy . Solid construction protects the contents and I like the side pockets and space for cords .  
1	  This is a very bad bug zapper . Although it worked fine for a week , it the proceded to die . This happened with TWO new units . No rain , no bad weather , just a piece of junk .  
2	  BUY BUY BUY ALL DAY LONG .. NO NEED IN READING ANY MORE REVIEWS .. THIS IS THE ONLY REVIEW YOU NEED .. AND IF YOU REALLY LIKE TAKING PICTURES TAKE THE ADVANTAGE OF THE AMAZON SAVINGS AND BUY THE 2.0 GB SANDISK .. MY 1GB MEMORY CARD HAD ALMOST A 1100 PICTURES ON IT .. WIFE LOVES PICTURES .. BUY BUY BUY WITH CONFIDENCE .. BUY .. DID I SAY BUY .. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR .. BUY ..  
2	  The Nintendo DS charger does essentially what it was made for : to charge your Nintendo DS Lite . I bought this real quick since I couldn't for the life of mine find my old charger , and two bucks was a great deal , honestly . Package arrived two days later , and , ba-zam , it charged the damn Nintendo DS , like it promised .  
1	  Quite happy with with the quality of the picture . My bulb lasted 370 hours . Disappointing for an item that claims a bulb life of 2000-3000 hours ! Tech support is fairly open about the nature ( .. ) : bulbs start to grow dim at about 300 hours , dying well before their box specs ; replacement lamps average ( .. ) . Someday some bright soul on the internet will find a way to replace the mercury vapor bulb within the lamp for a few dollars , rather than the whole lamp for a few hundred , but until then I would urge buyers to avoid this knockoff of the higher-quality , name-brand DLP projectors . Alas , I have learned the hard way that you get what you pay for .  
1	  Designed obsolescence is the word that best discribes Delorme No support !  
1	  I 've had this less than 6 mths , it already went out , and CS for the company is HORRIBLE ! First time i called i got a recording , it told me they were open 8-5 then I called the next day and I was hung up on when they found out i was not at home ( well sorry i work 8-5 and couldn't call from home ! ) I had my other router for YEARS never had issues , when i finally did , the CS department was very helpful . I only tried this one out after the other one was over 5 years old and needed newer software and this was a reasonable price . I wish i had paid more and not wasted my time or money on this POS !  
2	  does the job , comfortable , good material . Of course , the MX1000 is better but this is a good cheapo .  
2	  This tripod is inexpensive , versatile and lightweight . However , if you 're using a long lense in low light , I would go with something beefier . For it 's weight though , it 's about as sturdy as you can get , I love it . Perfect for backpacking . If ou 're not looking for something super sturdy , you can't go wrong .  
2	  These are great quality casters . You must make sure that they are installed at a 90 degree angle ! these work just as they said , but I would purchase a set with brakes next time . These want to travel a bit .  
1	  I was expecting something easy to use . Manul doesn't help at all . Picture is small on tv and not clearFit to tv doesn't work . Please let me know how can I return this item .  
1	  Bought to replace the worn out battery . This one isn't much better . It takes forever to charge and then if it 's not used for a couple of days it has to be charged again ?  
2	  It is a great product and worth every cent . It has made my efficiency on troubleshooting cables and connectors incredible . It is very simple and accurate . I wish it had connectors for the flat Molex 6 & 8 pin styles as well .  
1	  The radio is okay for AM & FM Reception . It has good FM Stereo Sound . However , The main reason why I bought the Grundig Yacht Boy 300 PE Was for the Short Wave Band . The reception is terrible and often non existing . If you want this radio for travel , be sure to bring an external antenna with you . Otherwise look for a better quality short wave .  
1	  Got this thing for the wife at Christmas and it 's already out of comission . The docking connector that the ipod connects to is directly attached to the circuit board so you need to be super careful in attaching and removing your ipod . The whole connector came free from the unit while removing the ipod , effectively making it a clock / radio . I 'm going to call and see how they want to handle the repair . If they start messing around I 'll let you know . Mike  
1	  I have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 DVD 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job . I have tried many times to get a hold of Apex who doesn't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( I believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked . As I emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red LED burning . Do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .  
1	  I had this camera for not even a year and was very happy with it . My only complaint was the weight due to the four batteries . That was until I used it to take pictures of my baby 's first Christmas and five minutes after I moved her pictures onto my computer the camera died on me . When I turned it on I received a " Memory Card Error " message . I reformated the memory card and was able to take a couple more pictures , but when I tried to view them I recevied the error message again . Then the camera would get stuck on , then it wouldn't turn on , then the LCD was blank , etc . etc . etc .. Currently it 's stuck in the off position and no matter how many fresh batteries I put in it , the camera won't turn on . It 's not the memory card because the card works fine in another camera . I needed a new camera ASAP for the holidays , so I signed onto ebay to see what was out there . Lo and behold I found many listings for broken A75 's . It seems that lots of people have had the same thing happen to their cameras . Also note that no other notable camera uses the same memory card , so when I bought a new camera ( I opted for the Canon A520 ) I had to purchase another memory card . Bah ! If you buy this maybe it will break down , maybe it won't . My advice would be to transfer all your pictures as often as possible . I am so lucky I saved all my baby 's pictures before the camera went out on me . If I lost all those shots I would have been livid .  
1	  Everything billed about this camera that is good , even its seemingly solid construction , is true-when you first get it . Then and quickly the camera breaks , and you discover , and I thought I 'd learned my lesson about this from another piece of Panasonic equipment years ago , that Panasonic is simply not a brand to be trusted . I confess I am especially annoyed with Panasonic right now because they advised me to send in my camera for repair , which I did , but they neglected to tell me that the flat fee for any repair would be more that it would cost at this point to just buy another one . That-and the shoddy customer service in general-is what drove me to write , but at bottom the problem is just that this camera is either just a piece of junk or , more cynically , has a planned obsolescence of something like 6 months past its year warranty . I would stay away from Panasonic-there are plenty of good other brands .  
1	  The setup is easy and it has some neat webcam type features . Picture quality is EXTREMELY poor . I never realized how valueable a preview display was either . Look elsewhere for a simple digital point and click .  
1	  I cannot find anyplace on this description where it says this item does NOT come with the neck strap . Since that is specifically why I bought this item , I will be returning it .  
2	  These are for anyone on a budget that wants to upgrade from that old pair of travel binoculars or from Uncle Fred 's 1954 hand-me-downs . They are * Waterproof * ( very important , it 's easy to confuse these with the lower-quality Nikon Action range ) and fogproof , with clear and bright images . Very solid feel and compact for a full-size Porro-prism design . The 7x35 version of the Action Extreme won the highest position in the Cornell Ornithology Lab 2005 binocular shootout out of 15 budget entries - probably because the 8x40 was not tested . Yes , they aren't perfect - higher price will get you sharper optics , lighter weights , and slightly better handling - but at this price the only alternative I could find is the Leupold 6x30 Yosemite for around 25 % less - and that model is a 6x magnification . I 'm not sure why , but many sites don't cover the warranty on these . You get excellent support from Nikon USA - a 25-year no-fault warranty with a $ 10 fix or replace fee for the original owner . Combined with the low price and build quality this could be the last pair of binoculars you will ever need to buy .  
2	  It 's just a right product for my new camcorder . The price I got is very good too .  
2	  There is a wide price range for laptop carrying cases . I wanted something relatively inexpensive because I won't use it a lot . Wanted to take my laptop on vacation . I was very happy with the quality of the bag & the # of storage areas it offers . Very good buy for the price .  
1	  I got my ipod for christmas and loved it at first sight . My mum went through hell to get it for me and it worked . I had my xmas present . BUT . It worked on windows XP , which i have , i installed the software , put a few cds onto itunes . I took my ipod off the computer AAND It didnt have any songs on it . I have tried loads of times to put the music on , but none have worked . It says it would work faster if i had a " hi-speed " usb port . What exactly is that supposed to mean . I have a fairly new computer , but it dosent appear to have a firewire or another usb port . There are 2 usb ports but one is used for internet . I really dont know what to do . Can anyone help ? from 12 year old who is going to eventualy break to her mum that the ipod that took months to get dosent work and really needs an answer sooner rather than laterThanks !  
1	  This unit worked well for about three days , then ceased functioning on my Windows XP computer . My computer kept wanting to format it but could not do so . The fix described on SanDisk 's WW site did not work and the SanDisk technical folks finally advised me to return it . I did , and requested a refund , not another one .  
2	  Other than the headpiece fitting a little tight , these are a quality set of headphones . Sennheisers are tough to top . I haven't found a worthy adversary yet . If the price is right , you won't be disappointed !  
2	  I can't say enough for this it gave me the length I needed for the computer and my printer . Thanks again  
1	  I have always loved Bose products , and the quality of sound from this product didn't disappoint me at all . However , I have very high expectations from Bose that this product didn't live up to . It 's my understanding that most sound docs will charge the iPod while it 's connected , but this one does not . Perhaps it is defective , or perhaps it 's a low end product .. perhaps my expectations were just unrealistic . I can't be entirely sure .  
1	  I bought this because my netgear stop working after two years of use . This one would always drop , so I had to unplug and plug this back into the computer everytime I walk away from my computer for 5 - 10 minutes . I got into that habit . So that was fine but now , this literally stop working . Its not even ONE YEAR ! , I will not buy this again for the price . Even though it does received a better signal but its not worth it . The last netgear I bought get good signal . At least it lasted two years .  
1	  I really , REALLY wanted to like this player . Hell I wanted to love it . For $ 500 , you should love your purchase . The video and sound are stunning - really they are . The problem is the performance . DVDs and HD-DVDs alike would hang . Sometimes rebooting the player would work . Sometimes the video would hang and the audio would continue . Sometimes the player would just lock up hard and I 'd have to power it off / on . This player is simply not ready for the real world . I 've returned mine and I 'm going back to my Sony upscaling DVD player until they can get this technology stable enough that it doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of a movie . I so wanted to like this player ..  
1	  bought a pair of these speakers to use in my backyard , one of the woofers stopped working , so the seller sent me a replacement . The replacement 's woofer was lose and the low end sounded awful . Got another replacement . A couple days after receiving the replacement , both speakers broke using a 75 watt receiver turned up less than half way  
2	  Everything you need to know about this player is addressed in the multitude of reviews on this site . The total number of reviews ( almost all of which are positive ) is a clear indicator that this is a great product . I hope to summarize everything I learned in my research , and now my experience , in this review . I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what DVD player ( s ) I wanted to purchase for an upcoming road trip . I wanted to be able to address the needs of my wife , dealing with a toddler on a daily basis , while also providing a solution for a teenager , pre-teenager and toddler on road trips . Eventually , I decided on purchasing two of these players and I am glad I did . I give the player an overall rating of 4 stars because there are some small things that Coby could have done to make the product perfect . The Good - what set this product apart for me * Compact and rugged design , everything feels well constructed on this player * All accessories are included ( headphones , cables , headrest mounting bag , remote , car charger , wall charger , desktop stand ) * Decent sound and image quality * Easy to use * PriceThe Bad - what to be aware of before you buy * Clamshell disc loading , the player must be removed from the provided case to change discs * The headrest mounting bag does not provide a snug fit , when attached to seats , it tends to flex and bend , potentially covering buttons or connections * The headrest mounting bag covers the IR receiver for the remote control ( I was able to work around this with a hole punch ) * The desktop stand is flimsy and not very secure * The device cannot be used as a monitor ( no A / V in ) . This means that you cannot hook up a video game system , and you cannot connect two together to watch one video . * The screen is relatively easy to scratch . I would recommend purchasing an adhesive screen protector ( preferably one that can be reapplied ) . These can be found from a variety of sources on the web . Overall , I am very happy with my purchase and hope to get quite a lot of use out of these . I purchased a two year extended warranty for each , just in case .  
2	  I am so happy ! I have tried a couple of Bluetooth adapters that did not work on my Vista 64 laptop . In fact the Rockfish micro adapter crashed my system and I had to restore Windows . I did a lot of research , mostly here on Amazon and found the IOGEAR GBU221 Bluetooth to USB adapter which claimed to work with Vista 64 . I followed the directions explicitly , but a problem arose right away . The first instruction was to insert the adapter in the USB slot . As soon as I did , Windows automatically started installing drivers . I had no options . Once the drivers and software were installed , I could see the Bluetooth adapter in device manager . I could also pair my Rocketfish Bluetooth headphones with the computer , but could not use them to listen to playback . I tried running the CD that came with the adapter and it exited immediately with the message that a later driver was already installed . I uninstalled the software and tried it again . Same problem . I called IOGEAR and they suggested I download the drivers from their web site , which I did . After installing them , the headset still wouldn't connect , though it would pair . I did have a new option on the right click menu for the headphones that was labeled " control " . I tried that and after looking around , I found that my headphones had the option checked which indicated that they had a display screen so I could type in a passkey . My headphones have no such display . I checked the other box that said " no display " and closed the program . I had to re-pair the headphones one more time and then EUREKA ! They worked ! One other note , the headphones had a " pop " every so many seconds . I went into the right click menu on the headphones and turned off everything except Audio , and remote control . Now the pop is gone and the signal is excellent . I can listen to the music playing on my laptop , anywhere in the house with no problems . Very nice . The headphone now connect instantly when turned on . One of the suggestions in the Windows trouble shooting guide indicated that a Bluetooth adapter might need more amps than those normally provided by a hub . This one runs fine without the hub being plugged into an A / C outlet .  
1	  Do not buy . Sounded great but died just past the warranty period of 1 year . Klipsch has yet to respond to support questions after one week . Definitely no repeat business from me .  
1	  I 've had this camera for nearly a year now . I was initially impressed with the quality of outdoor shots and really close-up portraits . It has this uncanny habit of darkening the background , but giving beautiful fleshtones and super clarity . The macro feature are also pretty cool , and I got some creepy closeup photos of some brown recluse spiders that we ran across in our basement . on the other hand , low-lighting shots are a real pain , and the only way I can get nice crisp images is to turn the flash off , leave the shutter open for a bit , and hope nothing moves during capture . My main reason for purchasing was that I had owned an Olympus point-and-shoot for several years that ran like a tank , and this thing had so many manual features for the price . I loved my little olympus point-and-shoot ( still have it , in fact ) . Unfortunately , my biggest complaint is that this Digital Olympus has killed 1 XD 1Gb memory card , and is now giving me the same errors with a new Fuji card that I just bought . The Olympus XD card is now totally unusable , and unreadable by anything . My new Fuji XD card is still working ( for now ) but the camera gives me sporadic errors at times ( like trying to force me to reformat over images on the card ) . I had heard that only unloading from the camera ( not a USB reader ) can help these problems , but with the new Fuji card I am still getting the errors . The software that comes with the camera is absolutely horrible .. locks up all the time , and is extremely slow to process anything . I emailed Olympus and they are saying that I can send it in for repair . May have to Ebay this thing if / when I get it back . XD cards are too expensive to have to replace every six months . Do your homework and decide if the extra savings are really worth the potential problems when considering this one .  
2	  I remember years ago having coffee at my mom 's . It was the best tasting coffee . Nowwith this coffee maker I get the best tasting coffee .  
2	  I work in a factory and I always have my Zune with me so I needed something that would protect it from damage aswell as dust . This case does just that , I don't have to worry about accidentally knocking it off the table , hitting it with a tool or it slipping out of my hand and I don't have to constantly clean it . And the thick plastic screen protector is something you won't get from any other case , buy it !  
2	  The Zip drive is lightweight , 5 " x7 " x1.5 " , and does what it 's supposed to do at a reasonable price . Sufficient for home office use . Setup takes about 15-20 minutes to install the drivers .  
2	  I liked this memory card because it offers enough space for all of my high resolution pictures . Even that it is a SD " HC " ( High Capacity ) , it works smoothly in my camera and laptop , I wasn't require to purchase any special adapters .  
2	  I loved the ease of using this device . When I first took it out for a test drive I delibertaley ignored directions to see how the recalculating route function worked and it performed flawlessly !  
2	  This bag is plenty big for me ; I have a D-200 with an 18-200 lens attached most of the time and it fits vertically into the bag just fine . There is also room for another couple of lenses , flash , batteries and other accessories . I wouldn't want to carry around any more . The only problem I have with this bag is the shoulder strap that I wish was wider , or had a padded piece over the shoulder . If you fill this bag , it can get to be a pretty heavy load . All in all though , it 's a well-constructed , functional bag at a reasonable price .  
2	  Not much to say - everything works wonderfully ! And I can finally stop hauling cords from the car to the house !  
1	  This made in China mp3 player looks very cheap from day one . Bought it in March , 2005 and used it for 2 month and it 's broke . The customer service put me on hold for a long time as well . Save yourself the trouble and get something else .  
2	  I recommend this product for canon holders especially 720 , u can record lots of movies with it  
1	  I bought this DVD / VCR combo from Best Buy about 13 weeks ago . The DVD player worked fairly well until the screen froze while watching The Ring . I could not get the unit to stop , play OR eject . I tried this several times with the remote and buttons on the unit over a few day period with no luck . Best Buy didn't want anything to do with it since it was over the 30 day return / exchange period . Sony now wants to charge me $ 29.95 to exchange it for a refurbished unit or $ 59 for fixing and returning my unit . So in summary , I spent $ 159 for the new unit , $ 29.95 for a refurbished unit and the associated shipping charges . Let 's hope that Sony can get it right the second time around . I would not recommend ANYONE buy SLVD350P from Sony .  
1	  The images seem good enough . The software , however , is SO SO anti-intuitive . Every little thing I want it to do requires 10 minutes of hunting through the program to find where the function is and how to apply it . I wish EPSON printers would make a comeback .  
1	  I got this for router for free after rebate from Circuit City with my new Compaq laptop . I was able to set it up and connect to the internet but have had an ongoing problem with losing connection to the internet . The router seems to continue broadcasting signal ; it is just that the internet connection is frequently lost requiring me to cycle / unplug the router in order to regain the internet connection . The modem does not disconnect from the internet and does not require cycling . The problem seems confined to the communication between the modem and the router . There seems to be a compatibility issue between the router and the AT & T ; provided Speedstream 4100 modem . Perhaps a modem setting that doesn't jive with this router ? If anyone has found the fix ; please post it because I imagine a lot of people with AT & T ; service who have the Siemens Speedstream 4100 modem and this router are having the same disconnect issue . I 'm about to the point of just buying another router . I 've had this about ten days and I must have unplugged it to reboot it at least 30 times .  
2	  I have used this Zune for quite a while . Just got tired of returning Ipods when they stopped working . This Zune keeps going and going .  
1	  I couldn't get this to work with my phone . Not sure if it is the product or if it is the phone . Hope to get different phone in future . Will try it again with new phone .  
1	  There was no indication that this was an upgraded memory chip that I was ordering . It would not work in my camera . When I received it the supplier did agree to take it back , but under the terms of Amazon and the supplier , the shipping charges were non-refundable . Last time I place an order like this . I had to pay shipping charges both ways which made the refund only worth about $ 5 after I deducted the shipping charges which were $ 26 .  
1	  The case came without screws or motherboard standoffs even though the description specifically said it does ( I 've checked everywhere ) . Tried to contact Antec to no avail . Didn't bother to return since I had a deadline to meet . Will not use Antec cases again .  
1	  First it has separate code sets for analog cable , sat receivers and digital cable . It defaults to analog cable , and who has an analog cable box .. This is an extra step before you enter the code that is unnecessary . Secondly the code listing is far from incomplete , as I was able to search and find at least three codes that supported my Comcast Motorola box , but ther listed code did nothing . They all worked , except for pulling up info , which is absolutely necessary with 500 channels . The display button on the remote inconveniently did nothing . This gets returned now , so I can buy another remote to agonize me . This should be pulled from market , and superceded with a remote with good documentation , code list and simpler programming .  
2	  The E5C 's were well made - very good sound but uncomfortable . The sound quality is noticeable better - cleaner lows and highs . I liked the build quality of the e5c 's better . These are so more comfortable . The rounded and lighter build contributes to the comfort . I really like the PTH - people come up to me when I am listening - one has to remove the earphone before the PTH . Many others don't think much of the PTH . Few other like the PTH but it is one of the best aspects of this model for me .  
2	  Before purchasing this camera , I read and studied reviews and product descriptions . I have had it about 3 weeks and I love it . I haven't spent much time learning all the features , just figure them out when the need arises . I have made some great photos without really reading the manual . These include a lot of indoor shots made without flash . Pluses : ease of use , rotating lcd , inexpensive batteries , andgreat photos .  
2	  The controls are a bit clumsy , but otherwise it works really well . I was quite impressed !  
2	  I followed the directions for setting up with a USB connection and all functions worked flawlessly . There seems to be some confusion on how to use an external telephone answering machine . I connected the external answering machine as described in the drawing . Then I set the FAX mode to manual as described on page 4-1 of the manual . The machine is set by default to answer the phone when it receives the FAX beeping sound from the other end . With this combination , if the incoming call is a voice type , the answering machine answers in the usual way and the FAX machine does not disturb it . If the incoming call is a FAX type , the answering machine answers but the FAX beeping signals activate the FAX machine to receive and it cuts off the telephone answering machine . All in all a satisfactory situation for myself who receives very few FAX transmissions . The unit goes into hibernate when nothing is happening and draws 10 W of power from the line . If you want to save even more energy you can turn the power switch off but the date and time are lost after a few days . I intentionally bought this refurbished version because they have better reliability than new ones . All of the early failures have been found and fixed . You are saved the bother of shipping a defective unit back to the repair station . I especially like the way all functions are run by keys on the unit . On the scan you have several choices for storage of the results . The OCR mode has some problems . When scanning the printout of an email , it missed several strings of asterisks used as separators between text sections . When scanning a legal document with signatures it got confused around the signatures and reformatted the text and made spelling errors . However correcting them was faster than retyping the whole document .  
1	  Recently purchased this DVD player ( region free ) from an Amazon seller and discovered it is actually quite a cheap unit . Crappy little remote that has the look and feel of something that will get busted if one looks at it sideways . The player itself is not much better in terms of ruggedness and workmanship . As soon as I connected the HDMI cable , I was greeted to a screen that constantly went from on to blank to on again . Tried two other HDMI cables , but the problem persisted . Had to return it to the seller , who fortunately will accept returns . Personally , I 'd look to spend a little more and acquire a better model . This unit has the appearance of one that you might be unlucky enough to receive at a $ 20 gift exchange at Christmas . Steer clear .  
1	  Took a disk that was skipping and turned it into one that can no longer be read . Do not buy !  
1	  The car charger actually come with the box . as I never buy Garmin before and it is recommended by Amazon so I bought it . I found that the one come with the box is more useful as it is connect to the unit that come with Garmin too . This charger has to connect to Garmin 's USB port itself and you have to plug / remove it everytime if you want to take your Garmin out of the car .  
1	  If you are interested in long lasting protection and clarity , try the NuShield brand instead . It works four times longer and will not cloud your screen . Find them at nushield . com  
2	  This is a solid hardware system and most the software is fine . No complaints as far functionality and using CDs . No offense but not that many people use Word Perfect and Quattro Pro . So if you want a smooth transition of documents to other systems you will want Microsoft Office . Granted MS Office is overpriced for that convenience but still it is the most widely used . I realize HP is probably trying to keep their system cost down but sometimes a little additional cost is worth it . Since HP could buy MS software in quantity it would reduce the cost to the end user , us . I highly recommend HP give that some serious thought .  
2	  Good cool video camera despite the batteries run out quickly . I am enjoying very much . It if fun to shoot with and make you tube videos .  
2	  I got this as a gift from a friend . ( Thanks again , Tara ! ) Mind that i am not from the US , i was worry that the FM radio that came with the package would not able to receives local stations .. Anyhow , everything seems to works fine . It plays the CD nicely , the speaker is average for matches its package price . , i uses my Edifier speakers to listen to Taylor Hicks CD .. , it really shaken up my room .. , Woo ! Overall , this is a good package thats came with a reasonable price . Give it a try if you haven't yet .. ;)  
1	  the quality of this webcam was excellent . However , I couldn't get it to work with Yahoo or Google .  
1	  This power supply appeared to be an Apple item , perhaps a refurb . It lasted just long enough to be non returnable and then it stopped working . I 'll be ordering another power supply , but not this one , and not from this seller . Pure junk .  
2	  I 'm not an audiophile , and rarely play CDs , and MP3s using my computer . But , I do listen to a lot of programs over the internet , and these speakers are great for that . Spoken words are very clear , back ground noises are discernible , but not distracting , and subtle modulations in tone give new color to speech . What music I have listened to sounds good , but I generally use my stereo system for that . I don't have much room for computer speakers either , and these are a perfect fit . Delivers sound that I 'd expect from a much larger , more expensive speaker .  
2	  TV : Sony Grand WEGA 50 inchReceiver : Harmon Kardon AVR330Sub : JBL 12inch NorthridgeFloor : JBL E80 NorthridgeCenter : Infinity Primus C254 Surround Sats : Klipsch SatellitesDVD Player : Sony DVP-NS50PGoing from standard unfilitered power to this unit was the best thing i have ever done for my home theater . The difference is HUGE ! and I highly reccommend this unit to anybody looking to add a totally new level of clarity and vibrance to your home theater setup . I can now turn the reciever up to full power and put my ear up to the speakers and hear ZERO buzz or noise . Previous to purchasing this power unit I could always notice a slight hiss in the system . This hiss was completely eliminated by the HTS3500 . The colors of my TV are also noticably brighter and sharper . BUY THIS !  
2	  This is a great little machine . Having used Palm since my IIx I was hesitant to switch but glad I did . The wireless connection works perfectly and effortlessly and from great distances . I have a MS 700 router and it reaches every room in our house ( attic , 2nd floor , 1st floor and basement it also reaches my pool are which is the farthest from the router and works perfectly ) . I thought I was going to have a problem with our older house and thick plaster walls but there was no issues . To connect to the WLAN basically , you turn the icon for WLAN on and the PPC does the rest . If you need a WEP key it will prompt you for it ( I still don't get the one reviewer who was knocking it for not having wireless G .. nowhere did it say it was included so why complain about something that you weren't being sold ? ) . I bought the Belkin GPS through belkin for $ 149 and it works awesome through blue tooth on this PPC . It has everything I need and I travel the US extensively . You will need a large SD card though 256 or 512 to make the GPS worthwhile but you can find them on fatwallet . com for a reasonable price . As stated I travel a lot and my company will not allow modifications to the standard laptop package so this enabled me to do a lot of personal stuff while on the road . Throough my BT phone I can surf if away from a WLAN or get emails . I do agree that the PPC should come with a hard case for the $ spent but I only spent $ 269 so why complain . That was a bargain from my point . The only other machine I considered was the Dell Axim x30 but after being told by a Dell rep that they were having " engineering " issues I went with this and could not be happier .  
1	  If you have unlimited time to program or are willing to have someone do it for you ; If you have the patience to reboot at least once a week ; If you pay for an extended warranty ; If you understand that support is poor for the first year ; Then this is the remote for you . Fragile , frustrating , but works very well 90 % of the time . I 'll buy a 1100 to replace my 1000 , but I am not happy about it .  
2	  This is a good piece of audio equipment . The connection mechanism has been improved over older models and the impedance compensating function is also an upgrade . However , be careful as to the manual . As hard as this is to believe , my unit had instructions for a prior generation of this product . The instructions for the connecting device have you pull the connector out of the back of the switch . If you 're successful , you will have rendered the switch inoperable . Otherwise , good unit .  
2	  The Olympus WS-331M is everything I hoped it would be . It records perfectly , and holds hours upon hours of data . I use it to record notes for documents I write at work ( I am a Technical Writer ) , and this enables me to get accurate information from the SME 's and not have to go back to refresh information . I also have dozens of MP3 's on here , and use it as I work to listen to the music I like to listen to . The audio quality is simply excellent . It records in 16 bit stereo , and the sound is clear and crisp , and when listening to music , it has the SRS WOW-XT package to give the music a more full sound . If I had to pick one complaint , it would be the MP3 's can only be a maximum of 256kbs , and cannot take any at 320kbs . But that is okay , as I really cannot hear that at much at all . I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for this kind of device .  
2	  1 . Whenever a family member comes over to babysit they don't end up messing up my system so bad that I have to undo the mess ( which usually involves them messing up my DVR and skipping shows that I recorded ) 2 . Less remotes to find3 . Less batteries used ( I went from 14 batteries to 4 batteries ) 4 . The remote does all the steps I used to ( ex . 1 . Turn on TV , 2 . Set to correct TV input , 3 . Turn on the audio system , 4 . Turn receiver to the correct input ) by just pressing one simple " Watch TV " button . 5 . Customize the buttons to the way that makes most sense to you .. wonderful . The only downside is that mySony Bravia L-Series KDL-32L5000 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTV , Blackneeded a bit more customization ( and I couldn't figure it out ) . After Googling and Googling and using a ton of trial and error , I finally got it right . The problem I was initially having was that when I pressed " Watch TV " or " Watch a DVD " or " Play a Game , " the remote would always get the input wrong ( HDMI 1 instead of HDMI 3 or TV instead of Component 2 , etc . ) The solution for those who are having the incorrect input chosen every time .. instead of having the remote cycle through the inputs do the following : 1 . Click on the " Device " Tab2 . Click on " Settings " next to the icon of your TV3 . Click " Adjust Inputs " 4 . AND even though your original remote has ONE BUTTON to choose the input , select " METHOD 2 " 5 . Make sure the next page matches your TVs input options6 . Match " InputVideo1 " with the first input , " InputVideo2 " for the second input , etc . 7 . Preform the quick check .. and it should work now ( at least it did for me ! ) Good luck .. the tinkering is completely worth the long term ease and convenience of this remote . Also , it is worth noting that everything else set up correctly on the first go-around . I think if I would have had a different TV the basic remote set up would have taken 10 minutes . Of course it is always fun to tinker and move buttons around based on preference !  
2	  Not much to say , works fine and was a great price . No need to spend too much for a name brand .  
1	  I bought the Carbon with high hopes , it seemed like a steal , and with the silver shell and red lights , was very good looking to boot . Aside from a few minor quibbles , I liked it fine , until about the 3 month mark , or more specifically , 5 days after the warranty expired . It pooped out with an " upgrader " message , and despite all my efforts , and 45 minutes spent talking to technical support , I couldn't revive it . So now I have a useless 200 dollar hunk of metal , and wish I 'd read a review like this before I bought it .. don't make the same mistake I did ! Oh , and I 'm not an isolated case either , check any Rio Forum and you 'll see plenty of instances like mine .  
2	  I have tried 4 different FM Modulators ( Transmitters ) to use with my I-pod , and this is the first that could transmit ' strong ' enough for living in Boston . In fact , this unit is so strong , that you can broadcast over a station that has faint music , something I found the I-trip , the I-tunes , and a whole host of other units couldn't do . Remember though , it still won't be as good as CD quality . With the other units I tried , I could get the music to work for a while , but as soon as I drove just a little ways , I would have to find a ' cleaner ' ( more static ) station - even just a hint of reception would throw the music off .  
1	  Tried to download firmware from Linksys as I was unable to connect through the internet with it after asking the tech guys at Verizon about the problem and they say it 's something about the router that is not working . I tried to download the firmware , but it lead to a dead link .  
1	  I 'm on line trying to find a replacement for our now-discontinued V-2800 tripod . The crank broke after limited use .  
1	  I purchased this universal remote hoping to find something that would replace a worn out remote for a small panasonic television in our kitchen . I have searched all over the internet trying to find the appropriate codes and can find nothing that will work . I have followed the instructions that came with the remote trying to get it to learn the code for the television and nothing works . The instructions say there is supposed to be a list of codes that comes with the instruction booklet , but I can find no list of codes in either the english language book or the spanish language book . I have wasted my money and time on this universal remote . Sony RM-VL600 8-Device Universal Learning Remote  
1	  I bought this product for almost $ 150.00 and had nothing but problems . The sub would cut in and out NONSTOP ! I even had to open it up and solder the spider wires to the subwoofer because I guess it wasn't worth their time to do when they made this terrible product . Even after that it didn't work . I called Pyle and they told me that I had to pay $ 20 + to ship it to them .. and if they didn't think it was a reasonable reason for me to send it back .. they would not give me a refund or a new product . Eventually I got it working and it worked great for about 30 minutes .. then the amp shorted and blew the fuse .. but not before it had the opportunity to fill my entire trunk up with smoke . The amp is completely fried and is unusable . Eventually I was forced to buy a new amp and completely bypass the one that was inside the tube .. which cost me another 60 bucks . Finally after countless hours of frustration and anger .. IT WORKS .. I would never recommend this brand to anyone .. this was a shoddy piece of equipment that has ZERO customer service to back it up . DO NOT BUY  
1	  The mounting screw is too long .. long enough to wear if you tighten it down it will dig into your camera body . My camera manual specifically warns against this . Why the heck would they make the stud so long-ridiculous . I am sending this back . I bought this because it had all 5 star ratings , I 'd give this ZERO stars if I could . And it does NOT support an SLR well at all , even with a short 50mm lens .. barely bump it and it will tip over .. the wind could easily tip it over cause it is so off balance . Also the thumb screw isn't easy to turn and you have to tighten it down hard to TRY to support the SLR .  
1	  I have had mine for quite a while only to have to fight with it in hopes of getting my radio to receive the weak signal . In order to help receive the signal I must put my hand near the left side to keep the worst of the hissing sound away like a poorly tuned radio . If I put my hand on the right side of the P25 , as to jump to the next song , it will tend to loose the signal . I tend to avoid taking on the hassle just to listen to my music over the radio . This is one product to avoid even if they gave it away .  
1	  Most good digital cameras use CCD lens technology . CMOS is old , normally used for security cameras . Even though I don't own this camera ( and I generally hate reading reviews by people who don't own the product ) , I have owned a Polaroid camera of similar specs & price - with a CMOS lens . It mysteriously died in less than a year ( company would service , but it would cost almost as much as purchase price for part ) and picture quality was horrible . I regret not having done my research , b / c I took pics of my first baby with it and now with my second baby on a Canon , I can totally see the difference in quality . General tip I 've learned : if the company doesn't have a history of making cameras ( 35mm cameras ) , then don't trust it ! ( Kodak and Fuji are probably OK , but not the best . ) I remember Oregon Scientific from the calculators I used while I was flunking calculus .. !  
2	  This holds the portable cd player real well ! Easy to keep clean and I find it durable to carry around ! I even remember to not leave this bag behind better then my purse or back pack ! In my opinion : I like this portable cd case ! I would recommend this for a gift and yourself !  
1	  These are by far the worst headphones I have ever owned . I got them because they are from a good brand and look nice . After a week of using them the sound in the right ear bud started to lower and sometimes would just go out . I changed the battery for the headphones many times and the sound was still no good . Another annoying thing about these headphones is that in the middle of the cord the plastic box for the battery hangs down , it weighs too much on your ears and is a hassle to carry around or find a place for .  
1	  I didn't even plug this baby in . I ordered it since it stated it was a flat screen . This screen is * not * flat . This screen is just as curved as a non-flat screen monitor is . If these guys think this monitor is flat , they better have their eyes checked . I sent this monitor back and purchased from circuit city a NEC Multisync FE700 + 17 " monitor . Now this is a flat screen monitor . Bottom line .. if you are thinking of buying this monitor because it is a flat screen , then don't buy it .  
2	  I recived the merchandaise in a good term . And everything allright  
2	  The sound is dynamic , not super bass-y . As an audiophile for super bass , these don't satisfy . The dynamics of the sound is very clear for easy listening . Another audiophile problem is that the it isn't very loud . Cranking it on my laptop is about natural hearing db . If you want the music louder for the experience , these won't do it . Also the dual cables for each speaker are thin and could break . No problems yet . These are comfortable and styling . The bass seems to improve over use , but the loudness isn't there .  
1	  ( please note : this review is intended for those at least vaguely familiar with digital photography . anyone looking to purchase a digital camera for the first time , knowing nothing , will not care about what i have to say , mostly ) I purchased this camera because I was in need of a cheap digital camera with zoom capabilities . Noticing that this camera not only had 3x optical zoom and excellent picture resolution for less than [ $ ] , I was enticed . I was also , however , disappointed . I got what I paid for : junk . My major qualm is with the picture quality of the camera in anything other than perfect lighting . Pictures turn out horribly , with texture lines all over the place and blurs where there really shouldn't be . The camera also has a bad habit of slightly discoloring things like skin . Focus times coming off of zoom are pretty bad - expect to wait 15 seconds after significantly changing the zoom before you will be able to take a picture of reasonable quality . The other major gripe about the camera is the battery life . You can expect to shoot through a 16 MB smart media card worth of pictures at the default resolution / quality on one set of 4 AA batteries . To make things worse , there is no way to disable the LCD screen while taking pictures . For people like me who do not use it anyway , this is a huge detriment , given that the LCD is what kills the battery the most . If you insist on purchasing a cheap camera with zoom , however , be my guest .  
1	  the buds don't fit very well and fall out - they caused a continual pain and made the outside of my ears soar from the many attmepts of fitting them inside my ear . Would not recommend , or buy again  
2	  I am addicted to music and now I can listen to it without any outside intrusions . Whether sitting on a New York City subway or on a plane , its a totally new experience for me . Initially I thought putting these earbuds in would hurt my ear canal , but its really comfortable and is a nice fit . I also like having the option of using either the plastic buds ( 3 sizes ) or the earplug-like molding foam . The bass really comes through as do the mid range and high end . I love a rich bass sound and the E2c really lets me have it . I also hear things in the music that are impossible to hear with conventional earphones . I highly recommend these earphones to anyone that diverse styles of music as I do .  
2	  This is a well dong product , holding up to all its promises . You can program your favorite radio show or use it as an alarm . Records voices on the fly . Easy and simple interface .  
2	  The " Barska Binocular Tripod Adaptor " is surprising sturdy and well made , especially for the low price I paid here at Amazon . We needed a second tripod adaptor for ourCelestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars w / Tripod Adapter . These binoculars actually come with a fairly good tripod adaptor , but we wanted to leave that one on our monopod and this one on a tripod . The quality of this Barska adaptor is better than the Celestron , in my opinion . Highly recommended !  
1	  DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A PALM ! Though it seems to be Palm 's fault for being uncooperative , there are no drivers yet available to make this sandisk product work iin a palm device .  
2	  Great product . Easy to install . Have had no problems . A lot better than my old Belkin router .  
2	  I had a Microsoft notebook mouse , but the receiver broke . When looking for replacement , I found this item and with such a good price I sprung for it . It is extremely responsive , and has very convenient slot for the receiver on the bottom of the mouse . Software can be downloaded from the Logitech web site ( fewer cd 's to clutter up my office ) . It is a quite small for a large hand , but the design seems to make it feel fine in mine . The receiver is about half the size of my previous mouse , which makes it protrude a lot less from the side of my notebook , and less likely to snag on something when moving your laptop with receiver in place .. The size makes it a good fit for most notebook bags . And best of all , you can't go wrong with Logitech .  
2	  Great product for the price it 's offered at . Used it with an Apple TV Receiver and after months of use , I have no complaints .  
1	  Just received the response shown below after me second email to Canon regarding my S400 . It seems familiar - exact wording that I saw on another website claiming ignorance about a problem . I have now filed a complaint with the California and New York Attorney General 's Office and the New York BB . I strongly suggest all of you with this problem to do likewise so we can build a fire under Canon . If your camera has this problem and you haven't yet posted to this site let us hear from you . We should also start posting to other shopping websites ( dealcatcher , epinions , etc ) as well as the photography sites , including their Letters to the Editor . We need to make others aware of the way Canon has turned this problem into a profit center . - Thank you for contacting Canon product support . We value you as a Canon customer and appreciate the opportunity to assist you . Please note , Canon USA does not monitor , confirm , endorse , or attest to the accuracy of any information posted on third party websites . It seems many customers are overwhelmed by the barrage of information ( or misinformation ) being posted on unregulated , non-Canon websites .

1	  I purchased the viking card for use with my new Canon 45s camera . I used it about 10 days when my camera flashed " card error " and I lost all my pictures . I went to the Viking web site where I found out how to return the card ( they didnt even ask what was wrong with it ) However that was almost 6 weeks ago and I still have not received a replacement . The website offers no way of checking on returns so I will have to call themto find out its status . I 'm buying a Lexar today because something tells me I will have future problems ( if I ever get a replacement from Viking .  
2	  Works like a charm . Easy to program . It 's inexpensive but does what it 's supposed to do . Recommended .  
2	  The Raynox M150 is a very cost effective way to get up close to bugs and flowers . I use it with a Nikon 50mm AF-D and a 55-200 AF-S . I 'm sure that a dedicated Macro would be better at some things but , for what I do , the Raynox M150 is great .  
2	  I purchased this card a month ago . I use it on my Dell Axim X3i . So far it has been fully compatible , fast , and flawless . I haven't owned another PDA or SD card so I can't give you a first-hand benchmark . But I can say that accessing the card is quick and I have not had any skips while playing my music files . The 256MB is good for the price if you wait for Amazon to drop their price in conjunction with the manufacturer 's rebate .  
2	  I recieved the 12 db power unit instead of the 10 db , which is OK with me . In my situation this device helped by improving the reception with my HD tuner . However the difference in not extreme , but it is an appreciable difference that makes the TV much more watchable . I actually use two of these devices , one in the attic near the attenna , an another on the other end of the cable , on the ground floor near the TV . The result is that the TV is watchable and recieves most of the local channels . These devices are not expensive but the help they provided really made a difference in my installation .  
1	  i purchased klipsch speakers because my friend recommended them . little did i know my sub would blow out after 4 weeks . i rarely play music over 50 % if you want real loud music , get a higher powered system .  
1	  I purchased this VCR as a primary unit in a home theater setup . Setup was smooth , especially the auto clock and auto channel setup . I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Moview Advance feature actually worked . It 's designed to skip the movie previews that are at the beginning of most commerical tapes . I tested this feature on a variety of tapes , and it worked as advertised . A great feature for those of us who 's kids are exposed to enough advertising as it is . However , extras aside , I found the playback quality extremely poor . There were visible lines and " waves " that appeared on commerical tapes as well as tapes that the unit recorded itself . Adjusting the tracking did not help . I really wanted to like this VCR but it 's going back .  
2	  i Just received my speakers today for my ipod mini . i Love it , its perfect for your room when you don't want to bother your ears with head phones or your office . i only see 2 problems , one is that the battery will have to be replaced many times or you will have to constantly charge your ipod but this problem can be solved by buying a wall adapter for the speakers . overall great product and worth the bargain , only 4 bucks ! One more great thing about it is , that it not only connects to the iPod , but nearly anything with a headphone jack ( computer , CD player , PSP , Nintendo DS , other name brand MP3 's .. Zune and anything you can think of )  
1	  I tried this with 2 different phones and 3 different radios only to find that the sound and signal were HORRIBLE ! I have used fm transmitters before and never had one this bad . There was one built into my last phone and it was incredible . You would think one built outside of a phone would be even better , but not this one ! I know the price seems to good to pass up , but it 's not worth the anger you 'll feel when you can't use it .  
2	  This was my first Sigma lens . Canon just doesn't have a 50mm 1:1 macro for full frame in their line-up . I really like the pictures I get out of this lens . I can have it on my camera all day and get a ton of different kinds of shots , from landscapes to close-ups . Compared to the Canon 50mm f / 2.5 compact macro ( only 1:2 magnification ) , I think it 's capable of slightly sharper results with less chromatic abberations , and of course it has more magnification in the macro range . This lens is relatively small and light , which makes it great as a walk-around lens , although it does extend to about twice its length for 1:1 macro work . The build quality is very nice and Sigma 's speckled matte black with gold ring is handsome , but the extending front element has just enough play to be able to feel it wiggling in my grip when I grab it , so not Canon L build standards . Auto-focusing is a little noisy , but quick and accurate . Manual focusing is quite pleasant , as the focusing ring is well dampened . The ring has about 180 degrees of turn for its macro range , but only about 1/2 " of that travel is for 2 m to infinity . The minimum working distance for 1:1 magnification ( the distance between your lens and what you 're focusing on ) is about 1 3/4 " , and for 1:2 magnification , it 's about 3 1/4 " . In reality , most of my macro shots are somewhere between there , but 1:1 will not be practical with this lens for most insects . There are two main drawbacks . The main problem that bugs me is that there is no full-time manual focusing in AF mode , which I have come to expect in modern lenses . If you 're auto-focusing , and the lens just isn't hitting the mark , you should be able to just grab the focus ring and manually fine tune it . With this lens , you need to flip the AF / MF switch ( awkwardly located , imo , by the lens release button ) , before the focus ring frees up , which inevitably results in missed shots . Secondly , although the optics are pretty great across most of the aperture range , the corners are a little soft wider than about f / 5.6 . This is not as bad as it sounds , since most of my shots wide open are portraits with nothing in the corners but blur anyway , but I expected better performance here . Fortunately , neither of these negatives affects macro photography , which is typically done stopped down and manually focused . This is a macro lens , and it does a great job at macro work . This is one of my most used lenses , and although it 's not the most exciting 50mm prime out there , it has just about everything I could want in a walk-around / general purpose lens , while delivering outstanding image quality where it counts . Positives : 1 ) Very sharp , for macro or otherwise . 2 ) Useful focal length while having 1:1 magnification . 3 ) CA and distortion are at imperceptible levels . You 'll never notice any purple-fringing with this lens . Negatives : 1 ) AF mode does not allow full-time manual control . 2 ) Soft corners wider than f / 5.6.3 ) The focus ring only turns about a half inch between 2 meters and infinity , while the macro range has close to 180 degrees of rotation . Overall , quite good and strongly recommended if you want a 50mm 1:1 macro for a full frame camera . -1 star because the corners could be better , and FTM focusing should be a standard feature for Sigma 's top of the line lenses , of which this is one . If you don't need the macro and just want a standard prime , then you might consider the Sigma 50mm f / 1.4 EX HSM , which has a wider max aperture , faster AF , has full-time manual enabled , and reportedly has better optics overall .  
1	  I did not have high expectations for these speakers , but I thought they would deliver decent sound for the money . I should have read the negative reviews ! On the plus side , the speakers sound okay in the mid-upper range ( though mid is a little lacking ) . Also , distortion is not an issue at reasonable volumes . But the bass is ridiculous . It 's muddy , and what it lacks in clarity it makes up in volume . Way too much volume . Even at the lowest setting , the bass dominates the music . I 've managed to corral it for the most part using an equalizer , but then I have to switch presets every time I listen to music with headphones . I don't hate bass . I have a Hsu VTF-2 subwoofer for my home theater and it rocks the house . But it also knows its place . The sub on the Logitech doesn't . I would give this product one star if it wasn't so easy to use an equalizer . The sound out of the box is simply unacceptable .  
1	  I would not buy this . This was purchased by my office . On the keyboard I really like the location of the back button , the calculator , home page and e-mail buttons . The keyboard and mouse are loud . I can't express how much I hate the mouse it 's really really noisy especially when scrolling and it eats batteries like you wouldn't believe and there is no warning that the battery is low . I would invest my money in a later model and get a rechargeable mouse , which will be cheaper than the money you will have to spend on batteries .  
1	  Please tell me if I will ever receive this item . I have waited a month already . I am referring to the adapter for my dx7630 . I have the lens but I cant use it without the adapter . Thanks in advance , Marvin  
1	  The software will not install on my Dell Precision 450 workstation so all of the extra keys are unavailable . I am unimpressed with the keyboard but , I am sure , I will eventually learn to deal with it . What is the greater disapointment is the mouse ; quite honestly I could aim a flashlight easier . The pointer is sloppy and inacurate and after using the mouse for a few hours there are times when the right button quits respondinding . If I put the USB dongle in a slot on the back of the computer , the keyboard and mouse quit responding , so I 'm stuck with the dongle up front . I am using the mouse keyboard to write this review and the mouse is absolutely frustrating at how inacurate it is . And to add insult to injury , Amazon dropped the price within hours of purchase .  
2	  Absolutely the finest camera I have ever owned ! A bit pricey for the dilettante , but certainly worth the money for anyone serious about their photography .  
1	  I bought this camcorder on September 28 , 2003 when it was still fairly new on the market and more expensive than it is now . By July 2004 both the LCD screen and the viewfinder just went black . No image but I was still able to record audio . I reported it to JVC . They told me I had to send it in for repair , which I did . It seems that this was a common problem . They didn't ask too many questions . The warranty had already expired so I had to pay a couple hundred dollars . Six months later , the same problem again . I called JVC again and told them the problem . The technician who attended to me suggested that I turn it off and disconnect all power for about an hour and then try again because " that usually works . " Now what kind of advice is that ? I need this camera to shoot footage of events . What am I supposed to do each time this happens ? Turn it off for an hour and ask the event organisers to postpone their events for an hour ? Anyway , even that super solution didn't work , so I called again and they said I had to send it in for repair again . So I asked , would I have to be sending this camera in to you every six months ? " No , " she responded but " thank you for calling JVC . " The words I would like to use to describe this camera and JVC cannot be expressed here but do not buy this camera ! For the short period of time that it did work , it was great , but I will never buy this or any other JVC product ever again . I thought about fixing it and then selling it used but then my conscience wouldn't let me pass this problem on to someone else . So I decided to write this review .  
1	  The sound on this unit is very nice , and the controls are easy to use but other than that it 's a total lemon . Unfortunately , the battery on ours stopped holding any charge at all so the unit must remain plugged in to use it . That 's a major downsize since we liked to move it around the house without the hassle . Also , on our Gen 3 nano , it causes a problem where the volume just goes up and up until it reaches the maximum . The nano does this even after it 's unplugged from the dock until you issue a reset command . This of course loses some of the settings so we only use the dock with our Gen 2 nano at this point .  
1	  AD SAY NOTHING ABOUT FOR USE IN AUTO . IF THEYCAME WITH A ( IR ) INFERRED TRANSMITTER THEY WOULD WORKFINE I GUESS . BUT THEY DON'T . SO IF YOU DON'T HAVEA INFERRED UNIT FOR GET THIS ONE . BY THE WAY WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IR MEANT .  
1	  This is suppose to be a CLEAN , LIKE NEW ? Are you kidding me ? Someone Seriously needs to look up definition of CLEAN - THERE 'S DIRT , CRAP UNDERNEATH THE KEYS , THIS IS SOMEONES OLD KEYBOARD - I AM PISSED !  
1	  Just as the previous reviewer stated : got two and they both failed within 1 week 's use ! I also didn't like that the description states that there is a necklace and a clip in the box ( there isn't ) . Amazon did write me that there were higher than normal problems with this item .  
1	  was pleased with the cable modem .. it was as stated and pictured . Motorola was one recommended to me and it is working fine .  
2	  The item shipped within 2 days . I purchased an iPod for my child and this complimented it well .  
2	  I bought this unit a week after it was released in 2006 and love it . Feature rich , easy to use , and a great unit . Durability : Pretty durable overall . Only issue I 've had is needed to clean the contacts for the face as it caused the display / controls to stop working . But that 's a maintenance issue , as cleaning them off fixed the problem , so you can't blame the unit for that . I will list the things that aren't perfect about it , as the rest I am super happy with : - Auto EQ is a waste and a pain to use . You have to have the unit out , as it uses the same jack as the Bluetooth microphone . After it does run , it did a very poor job setting up for my system ( in my 02 Avalanche , running Kicker Components in the front , Infinity Coax in the rear , 2 10 " Kickers w / an Eclipse amp ) . I 've used the Auto EQ in other devices with great success ( such as my Harmon Kardon receiver for my home theater ) , but this one is crap . That said , setting the settings yourself isn't hard or time consuming . - WILL NOT CONTROL iPhone / iTouch devices . I have the iPod adapter , but Pioneer doesn't sell one to allow for these devices . But it never advertised it could either , and wasn't an issue when this unit came out in 06 . - Bluetooth microphone sucks . Picks up a lot of noise . I rarely use it because of this . Otherwise I love my unit . BT Audio is awesome and I use it a lot , connects fairly fast . EQ and crossover settings work well . I haven't used the CD player on it in years , but I recall it working well and not skipping . I just run my Sportster 5 Sirius unit through the AUX input , so I haven't got to experience tuning Sirus through it . I use the unit to run my mid 's and high 's , and it does a really good job , to the point I ended up not buying an amp to power them like I intended to do eventually . I love this unit , but am getting the itch to upgrade to a newer unit . The MVH-P8300BT is looking mighty tempting right now !  
2	  This kit comes with so many extra parts , its a bit ominous at first . Once you narrow down the parts to your specific applications it 's a very smooth install . The finished product has a factory look and I would highly recomend this product . I read a couple of reviews that complained about having to remove a couple of mounting tabs , but I just used wire cutters and trimmed with a razor knife for a smooth fit .  
2	  I bought this lens for macro work after I saw the photos of a member of my camera club made with the same lens . I wasn't disappointed . Photos are sharp & clear .  
2	  I received the product shown and it worked great . It didn't fall out of the wall outlet even with heavy power cords attached . I would certainly purchase it again .  
2	  The bracket is very compact and secure . Installation would be easier if the screw couldn't come loose from the bracket when you open the backet to fit it over the handlebar . The bracket requires that a new back be installed on the GPS receiver . The back does not secure as easily as the original . I am afraid that the tightening mechanism will break because it requires a lot of force to lock the back onto the case . Once secured , the bracket and GPS receiver are solid on the bike . It is possible to leave the new back on the receiver for handheld use , but it is difficult to change batteries because of the stiff lock .  
2	  The Solio better energy iPod charger is a fantastic product . On a sunny winter day it charged 50 % in a time span of about an hour or so . It will also charge in the closed position ( for when you don't want to draw attention to yourself in a public place ) . With two fanblades open it looks like a cell phone , everyone who has seen the charger with two fanblades open has told me that and it helps in being less conspicious ( as people just assume its a new phone ) . It also comes with a suction cup and I haven't really used it because .. 1 . The warranty doesn't cover damages caused by the suction cup coming loose and falling to the ground . 2 . Putting a pencil through the slot and aiming it towards the sun is much easier . The button on the charger was also perplexing , but I figured it out from the multilingual packet and this is what it does . Pushing the button once when its not connected give a battery life estimate ex : 1 flash = 25 % 2 flashes = 50 % and so on . While connected it does not automatically realize its hooked up to the iPod . A push of the button and it will start to charge the iPod . Overall this is a great product that deserves more attention .  
1	  YOU WILL BE REPLACING THE BATTERIES AFTER EVERY USE , IT SEEMS . THEN , YOU MUST RESET ALL THE SETTINGS LIKE THE DATE , THE TIME , BEEP SOUND ON OR OFF , CONFERENCE OR DATA ETC .. WHAT A PAIN . NOT TO MENTION , THE SOUND QUALITY IS TERRIBLE . AND GOOD LUCK FINDING ANY STORED DATA , OR TRYING TO ERASE FILES . IT 'S NOT WORTH MY TIME . I 'M RETURNING MINE FOR A REFUND .  
1	  When I tried to put music on my PSP maybe 10 or so got by the corrupt data , so out of 4GB only a few MB actually didn't get corrupted , a sad sad day indeed . pass it up and get a sandisk , your data will thank you later .  
2	  Bought the Viking Intelliflash USB Flash Memory Reader because transferring my digital photos from my camera to the computer was too slow . It would take over 1 minute per photo to transfer . Now , with the Viking CF reader , it takes about 2-3 seconds per photo to transfer . It works great !  
2	  I have had the battery and carrying case for about three weeks and found the case to be very light , durable , and more than adequate in size to carry any extra accessories ( cables , docking station , etc . ) . I have used the battery in place of the standard battery to insure that I will not run out of power in the middle of something important ( such as a recent wedding ceremony ) . I was not disappointed though I haven't put it to an extended test to determine total battery life . The combined offer sweetened the deal even more .  
1	  Have had this recorder for over a year and had nothing but problems . The lips are out of sync with the audio and is very tempermental when recording . I have had no problem getting finalized discs to play on any other players , but have ended up with way to many coasters ( approx . 1 in 3 or 4 are wasted when it just records for 20 min . to almost 2 hours of shows or movies I am trying to record then stops on it 's own ) . I use only DVD-R of different brands and it doesn't seem to matter . I tried the fix suggested by another reviewer to hold down the up and down channels at the same time to reset the machine . It does say on screen that the recorder is reset , but it didn't change a thing . I would not recommend to anyone to purchase this recorder unless you are looking for a frustrating pain in the butt !  
1	  Do not buy if you have other wireless or cordless items . The mouse stops working because of interference and the battery life sucks . It can really get frustrating during the middle of a important situation and your battery dies / loses connection .  
1	  I purchased these a few months ago thinking they would be a sound improvement over my Klipsch pair ( see other reviews ) , but found they are way too heavy ( physically ) in the ear and do not have sound quality as good as the Klipsch . Shipped them back to Amazon after a few days .  
1	  Just returned the 17-85 IS to Amazon after testing . 28mm WA detail very soft with significant CA - not nearly as good as the 18-55mm kit lens ' performance . 45-128mm range not up to quality of the 28-135 IS lens I replaced this one with . Hoping next copy of this lens is much better or I made a big mistake selling my 28-135 IS ..  
1	  I recently upgraded my home theater system and was looking for a moderately priced 12 gauge wire to connect the speakers . After reading reviews and descriptions on just about every package of wire sold on Amazon I chose this based on the price , reviews and the fact it was sold in a 25 foot package . It arrived yesterday and is being returned today . The picture shows what appears to be a blue tinted clear wire . That 's not what is on the spool I received . What I got is a thick , dark blue wire that resembles a utility / industrial electrical cord . There is nothing clear or tinted about it . The actual wires are encased in an outer shielding that is a thick , opaque rubber , making the overall product closer in size to an 8 or 10 gauge . It is completely inappropriate for an exposed wiring application . It should be sold as for use ' in wall ' or concealed . I 'm sure the sound would be awesome if I were to have wired my system with this cable . But there is no way I can string and conceal this cable around my room .  
2	  Once you get this gizmo going , it works nicely . You can connect multiple computers on your home network to a printer that 's within WiFi range . But setting it up is a challenge , because you have to do exactly the right things in exactly the right sequence , and some of the things you have to do right aren't mentioned in the setup wizard that runs when you insert the Linksys setup CD into your computer , or they 're mentioned so late in the process that you may have to start all over again ! The process takes about 90 minutes if you do everything right the first time around and don't have to double back . Most of the time you 're watching software load - it 's as exciting as watching paint dry . Here 's what you have to do , as far as I 'm able to recount from having just done it for a friend 's home network . If you think the following is written in Greek or maybe in Geek , get someone else to do this for you . If you 're up to the challenge , this review may save you time and frustration and prevent more 1-star reviews . ( 1 ) Before you set the print server up , it 's a good idea to go to the web site of the company that makes your router ( Linksys , D-Link , Netgear , etc . ) and download and install the latest " firmware " for your router . That takes maybe 15 minutes . ( 2 ) Move the printer close to the PC that 's connected to your wireless router . It has to be close enough to the router for you to connect it via a standard Ethernet ( " patch " or " Internet " ) cable . It 's not a big deal , but it means you may have to set the printer up in one place and then move it back to where you want it to be . ( Linksys supplies the necessary cables in the box , which is to their credit . Most printer manufacturers make you buy your own cable . ) ( 3 ) The printer needs to be set up on the computer using a wired ( USB ) connection * before * you try to set up the wireless connection . If you 're just going wireless with a printer you 've already installed on the PC that 's connected to your WiFi router , you 're all set . But if you 're installing a new printer , or trying to go wireless with a printer you 've moved from some other computer , be sure to install it as a USB printer first . ( 3-a ) Once you have the printer set up as a wireless " network " computer , you may want to uninstall the USB version of the same printer , because when you boot up , some versions of Windows will give you endless warnings that the local printer isn't connected . ( 3-b ) This also means that if you ever buy a new printer and you want to connect it wirelessly via the Linksys print server , you have to install it first as a ( wired ) USB printer , and then re-run the " Set Up Computer " wizard from the CD that comes with the Linksys . Don't lose that CD ! ( 4 ) The setup wizard asks for a password for the print server . You can use any password you like , BUT then it asks for a passphrase , and the wizard fails to point out that you need the exact WEP passphrase or WEP key you 've ( already ) used to set up your wireless router . ( You are using WEP or stronger security on your wireless router , right ? If not , go find out how to set up WEP security and do it immediately . ) ( 4-a ) The setup wizard asks for a passphrase , but if you 've used a passcode on your router , there 's a way to enter it you look carefully at the screen . ( 5 ) Once you complete setting up the wireless print server , the wizard leads you through setting up your computer . Again , you must have already installed the printer onto the computer via a USB cable before you get to this point ! Follow the instructions and by gosh - it works ! Then at the very end there 's a small note saying that if you want to set up other computers , you have to install the printer drivers first . Nice of Linksys to point that out at the very end ; it would have saved me an hour of messing around if they 'd said that at the beginning ! ( 6 ) Once the printer is set up , it 's the default printer , and it wasn't possible ( at least for me , with Windows XP ) to set a different printer up as the default printer on one of the computers on my home friend 's network . A minor irritation , in most cases , and there may be a workaround . If I find it I 'll add it to this review . So : 5 stars for convenience once it 's set up ; 3 stars for the glitch with the default ; 2 stars for poor setup instructions .. how do you rate this thing ? 4 stars , I guess .  
2	  Makes it easy to use or not use a filter without spending a lot of time . Makes it easy to use or not use a filter without spending a lot of time .  
2	  Item was shipped promptly , and worked great . It was as described , and the price was reasonable .  
2	  Everything is what I want . If anything to improve , it can only be charged with car charger or USB connected to laptop . I would like to have a stand alone charger so that I can enter some addresses without turning on my computer .  
1	  I cannot recommend HP to anybody anymore . The company introduced regional coding , which means printer cartridges from one region cannot be used in another . For most this is probably not an issue , for those busily traveling around it is . Also , it is an issue of principle , its bad enough for DVD , but printer cartridges ? HP has introduced this rather secretely and if you don't read the box cover etc very carefully , you may not notice . The main issue is in Europe . I got caught out . I bought a 3 catridges overseas - I could not use them on my HP printer . I asked for a refund , HP Email Support ( US ) was nice but ineffective . HP Customer Support ( Europe ) was snotty and very rude . I think HP does not care about its customers and this cost me over US$75 , almost 50 % of my printer ( my sixth and last HP ) . Don't buy HP .  
2	  If you are not a computer person and just need a simple mouse pad this will do for its cheap price .  
2	  This is a fine tool set for a basic computer building effort , and it 's well regarded for the price . Recommended .  
2	  This is one of the few replacement batteries for the Powershot cameras that appears to act like an original battery in regards to taking and holding a charge . I have been using the camera with this battery on a regular basis for over a month and it is operating like new . I have bought many many replacement batteries over the last few years that claim to be great but are just duds . I have previously found the Duracell battery to be a good product , but they were out of stock when I went to order a few weeks ago .  
1	  sound is decent for the price , but the mini-plug broke after a month : the metal tip separated from the plastic housing . ( Don't know if getting fixed is worth the hassle . ) Wish they would make these of better quality .  
2	  Adds comfort but looks quite strange on a desk in the office . Consider home use .  
2	  I 've had mine for almost a year now with no problems . Amazingly handy and very inexpensive product . I would recommend the Hydra to anyone .  
1	  With all honesty i am lazy in reading any manuals so i am just rating this with a bit of experience . I actually have my camera for more than a year now and still , i haven't read my manual so i can't really complain much . But this camera frustrates me though in terms of the shutter speed , it really sucks unless there is a way in the " manual " to adjust it . Sometimes image are good but sometimes not . I can't really say if it 's a good camera or not but i guess the best way is to read the manual which i am planning to do pretty soon so i won't waste the money that i spent for it . In short , if you are not planning to read the manual or lazy enough to do so i would say do not buy this product , it will frustrates you too .  
2	  This little machine is a beast ! You can feel the air being pulled out but the best part is you can't hear it at all ! Wonderful for gaming since you don't want any distracting background noise when you are deep in it .  
1	  looked like a good product , interesting idea , good extension option for a media center environment or for ripping dvds - just didnt do it for me really though - pain in the a $ to set up , no real documentation , no hdmi connection , no usb connection ? , lots of old school rca cables - felt like i was highjacking a flea market device - still willing to try other products from this company as this device is still pretty innovative and great concept - next time neuros  
2	  Bought this to replace an ancient Xerox WorkCentre that finally gave up the ghost . It is much faster , very simple to set up and has all the features we need . It 's used 20-30 times a day in our office .  
2	  I got this item for my son for Christmas , he loves them . He downloaded his music on it with ease and still has room for more . He said that they are comfortable and cool . All of his friends are wanting a pair . This is a great product at a great price . Buy with confidence .  
2	  I ordered this ( relatively ) small microSD card for my burn phone to store the files I need for work . It 's been a dream . Snapped it into place and it showed up immediately on the phone as well as when I plug the phone into any system .  
2	  Bought this for my wife , who does not like in-the-ear phones . We compared at home against a 10-year old pair of Sony noise-cancelling phones and found these to be much more cushy and comfortable since they go over the ear rather than on the ear . They also provided slightly better noise cancellation than the Sony phones when used against a microwave oven . She used them on flights to and from Hawaii and raved about how well they worked so I 'm happy . The only downside is that they do not fold up like the Sony phones but fold flat into a nice provided case which takes up more room . This is the same downside to much more expensive Bose phones . Otherwise , these are at least the equals of the Bose at half the price . They also run for many plane flights on just one AA battery .  
1	  ( Tiffen 67mm UV Protection Filter ) I knew it would cause reflection of lit-up areas of my picture composition and thats what its doing so i cannot blame it . I ordered another better filter for quite an expensive lens of mine alongside this one which was multicoated . From this filter you should only expect dust protection and that 's it . That 's enough for its cost  
2	  I love the TomTom GO 720 . It recalculates quickly and finds the shortest route all the time . My only issue is the Bluetooth speaker phone feature , it doesn't seem to work well for me .  
2	  We use this charger all the time and have had no problems . Very good buy !  
2	  This was a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it ! Very high quality . Best price on the web .  
1	  This is a very compact unit , using only a single AA battery for power , with a built-in USB connection for downloading music . Unfortunately , that 's where the compliments end . I 've found this device to be unreliable and generaly flakey . Some music files cause playback to simply freeze , requiring a " reboot " ( unplug the battery ) to continue . Often the unit will simply stop playing " for no reason " . The tiny amount of power available from the single battery is insufficient to produce any kind of volume , even on very efficient headphones . Operating at higher volume levels ( more than 3/4 of the way up ) results in the unit shutting down after a few minutes . Even the most efficient external speakers elicit the same result . I would expect that all of the other MuVo TX family members are just as flakey , but this is the only one I 've tried . I wouldn't recommend this unit or any of it 's siblings to anyone .  
2	  We use this to provide wi-fi in our home to our PC laptop , two iPhones , and our iPad and to network everything back to our PC desktop . Works great . For the price you can't go wrong .  
2	  Maybe there are units around that have different firmware , but my player plays DTS as well as DTS-Audio with no problem on a Pioneer VSX-D409 DTS / DD reciever . I tested Gladiator , Saving Private Ryan , etc .. Still satisfied with this player , my only gripe after using it for almost a month is that FF / RW scan is not very fast .  
2	  This is a great little player for the money , you will not find a name brand for less . I used it on a car trip for 13hrs straight and the player didn't over heat like others I have used . Just make sure you don't have the battery in while it is plugged in a are watching . The piture and sound our great , no problems  
2	  I have been a long time video camera user , and this is my first time moving away from using tapes . I could not be happier . No more worring about what tape is in the camera , if it at the right spot . Just pick it up and go . The 7 hours on the best quality it plenty of time and the download to the computer is easy . I love the touch screen controls as well . So far no problems . I did think that the download to the computer would be faster .. could just be my computer because I don't have a USB 2.0 connection , just regular USB . Still , way faster than having to play it in real time , and you don't lose quality .  
2	  Our speakers arrived today , and they amaze us . Great sound , well-constructed , fold up compactly for easy travel . Since the frequency response is 150-18KHz they do put out nice sound .. not the " tinny " version I had feared . These are nice little speakers ! ( After all , they ARE amplified ) The included USB power cable allows you to power them from a computer , and also from an " IPod " charger / adapter . Actually , we 've just ordered a different brand " IPod " power adapter from Amazon for $ 2.99 ( iPod USB Travel Power Charger Adapter , by Handhelditems ) . Why waste $ 30.00 for an Apple version ? If you want nice sound from small speakers , these little beauties won't disappoint you . You 'll be pleasantly surprised !  
1	  I bought a Pentax K10D two years ago . The camera seemed to work well , but several months ago the image sensor went bad - pictures were in magenta and blue . Returning it to Pentax for repair , I got a quote for repair of $ 400 ! Their lousy sensor goes bad , and because it was past their feeble one-year warranty , Pentax will do nothing to correct what is clearly faulty manufacturing or parts . Do yourself a favor and steer clear of Pentax - they will not support their products , and your money would be much better spent on another manufacturer !  
1	  I bought one of these at .. for my wife 's birthday . I am revulsing in shame at the poor design of the user interface of this unit . Numero uno . The player doesn't save your place when you turn it off . OK . A lot of them don't , but I 'm not anywhere close to finished . Numero dos . You can't browse through directories ( albums ) on an MP3 disk , only songs ( all 200 of them , right ? ) . To locate a particular album , you had better already know the names of all the folders on the disk . You have to do an alphabetical search to get to it . One workaround I can think of is to prefix numbers to the folders prior to burning the MP3 disk . This requires more computer skill than should be required for a device that costs sixty bucks . Numero tres . OK , let 's assume you know the names of all the albums on your MP3 disk , or that you implemented the workaround I just described . You 're playing the disk and you want to switch to a different album . You do the search . You get .. NOTHING ! Why ? Because you have to back all the way out of the directory structure to get to the album information . This involves STOPPING the player altogether , and whatever else you were doing ( like driving ) , THEN do the search . In short , one would expect an MP3 player that includes a car kit to be reasonably user-friendly enough to be used while driving a car . Memory would be nice . A quantity equivalent to an .. alarm clock would suffice . That way , you could leave the thing in your car and NEVER have to touch it again . I would have EASILY traded the four-line scrolling display of the names of the songs , the artists , the running time , and on and on - nice frosting , but not enough cake - for about ten minutes ' worth of thought about how these items are used . The MP3 format has soo much potential , and too many of these gadgets fail to come anywhere close to meeting this potential . The engineers ( or trained monkeys ) who designed this thing need to be sent back to school - on the short bus .  
1	  Great features and well thought out . But the quality is horrible . Mine randomly ejected disks and screen started going bad after only 2 weeks . Afraid to buy anything Audiovox or EddieBauer after this . Luckily was returned for refund .  
2	  I got this camcorder for my daughter in law for Christmas . She popped a DVD in and immediately was recording . Good quality and very easy to use . Samsung SC-DC173U DVD Camcorder with 34x Optical Zoom  
1	  I found the signal attenuation on this device to be so great that it didn't work in either direction for any of my digital devices . Cable length didn't appear to make any difference as mentioned in another review . The only good thing I can say about it is that it was cheap enough that I could just toss it in the garbage rather than take the time to send it back .  
1	  This screen was delivered with severe wrinkles both vertically and horizontally . I hung it open in hopes that they would hang out , but the vertical wrinkles became worse . This makes horizontal lines appear to be crooked and it distorts movement . This is worse than a white wall for home video . The bottom clamp on the screen was assembled without any attempt to properly stretch the lower part of the screen . The result is an unwatchable image at this size . I have now read several reviews both here and elsewhere online which mention the same issue . It is not a small problem . Avoid this product . I am trying to return my screen and have gone back to my 80 inch DaLite .  
2	  I bought this mouse to go w / my laptop . I love it except for the super long cord . There is a debate on if it is 3 or 6ft long .. but it 's too long for me either way . Other than that though it has been extremely durable and I can use it on just about any surface . I highly recommend it . :)  
1	  Where to start ? OK , how about the on off switch on the transmitter that 's located inside the battery compartment . So in order to turn the transmitter on or off , you have to open the battery door . Brilliant . Of course in order to open the door you have to remove that pesky plastic pocket / belt clip . Oops , that belt clip broke the first time I removed it . What the heck , let 's see how it actually works . Ok now , figure out how to program the settings for high and low Smoker temp , meat temp , and why not use that timer function also ? Don't forget to turn that alarm on , and of course make sure you have the F / C function set correctly . Good luck here . Too many functions and too few buttons makes this a chore at every use . Or how about the update speed of the unit ? I used it today ( for the second time by the way ) . I inserted the smoker probe ( yes , the correct one ) into a 300 degree grill and it took 15 minutes for the unit to slowly ramp up to temp . Put this all together and hence the title of this review - Are you kidding me ?  
1	  Bought these through antonline , left headphone cut out the second day . According to policy , you can only return to antonline if the product came in the mail already broken . Now I have to figure out how to have the manufacturer repair it . Did I say the only reason I bought these is to replace my other head phones ( the same brand ) that broke the same way after 3 months ?  
2	  Bought thisTRENDnet 108Mbps Wireless Super G USB Adapter ( TEW-444UB Version V1.1R ) last fall during a Gold Box Deal , and it has served its purpose a number of times . Have been using it as a general purpose backup for notebook PCs and as test device for wireless installations , mostly where the OS is Windows 2000 / XP ( SP1 / SP2 ) , 2003 Server , or Vista . Linux is not a supported operating system , but the listed chipset for the TEW-444UB is ' Atheros AR5523 + AR2112 ' , so there may be 3rd-party Linux drivers available if one looked . This reviewer found excellent wireless connectivity with 802.11g or 802.11b networks , and also found it to be backward compatible . Was able to reach the listed 108Mbps speed under certain installations , but do remember that speed performance and coverage may vary depending on an individual network environment . If you get one of these wireless adapters , be sure to check under the white section of the packaging , where you 'll find an excellent 5-foot USB 2.0 cable . This isn't noted in the specs , and happens to be an excellent USB 2.0 extension cable . A friend got one of these and almost threw the box away without checking under the white cardboard section . Should you need longer , then thisTRENDnet USB Extender Cable ( 5m , 16.4ft ; ( male to female ) should do the job . It 's highly suggested that after you install the drivers form the included CD-ROM disc , you go to the TRENDnet Website ( see comments ) and check for any updated drivers . Installation of updated drivers will often eliminate those annoying networking issues that can ( and will ) sometimes occur . Should you need speeds higher than the 108Mbps offered , theTRENDnet 300Mbps Wireless N USB Adapter ( TEW-624UB Version 1.0R ) should fit those needs , and it works with Mac OS X v10.4 and above , which isn't supported by the modelo reviewed here . Though Vista is not listed as a recognized OS for this device , it actually is supported , and the appropriate drivers for the TEW-444UB are available for download from the TRENDnet Website ( see comments ) . The steps for installation under Windows Vista are as follows : Step 1 : On the bottom right-hand corner of the screen , right click the wireless network connection icon and select ' Connect to a network ' . Step 2 : Select the desired network and then click ' Connect ' . Step 3 : Enter the security key and then click ' Connect ' . Note : If you 're connecting to an unsecured network , click ' Connect Anyway ' . Step 4 : Click ' Close ' . Summary .. General performance : 4-stars ; functions as expectedConnectivity : 5-stars ; no issues foundInstallation : 5-stars ; very easyOverall : 5-stars ; excellent value for the money , especially if you find it at a reduced price . Adding to the value is that five-foot USB 2.0 cable that one will find under the divider . Recommended .  
1	  I was initially thrilled to get the wireless keyboard and mouse at the great price , although I bought it because the mouse fits better than other big ones on my hand . However , after using for three months , I had to give up using the mouse , as the mouse seem to roam freely on its own will . I mean the mouse cursor on the screen . I guess , it is due to noise from all the other wireless device near my computer desk - couple of 2.4 GHz phones , wireless router , bluetooth headphones and transmitter , and probably the huge speaker on which this mouse transmitter sits ( and the fluroscent lamps , VCR , printers and what not ) . I am not sure of noise problem on the keyboard , as I do not type that much , but I do graphics with the mouse , and it is a pain to point at anything accurately - it will move slightly at the last moment on its own . So today I had to switch to the old wired $ 5 mouse back . Also , my wife uses the keyboard much , and she immeditely noticed that the letters on the keys are printed very small , and like us , if you are used to type while looking at the keys ( not a touch typist ) , it is a strain to look at the much smaller letters - about half the size of letters on standard Dell or Gateway keyboard , which I had earlier . Also the key clusters on right have changed as noted by another reviewer , but I can live with it . Since I switched to wired mouse , I guess I will switch back to my earlier wired keyboard which came with my desktop , and put this wirelses set on sale on crigslist or ebay .  
1	  The first couple of months we loved this player and loaded our whole CD collection onto it . In month eight , the player battery would no longer charge with an AC or car adapter . We drained the first battery and bought a new battery . While trying the various suggestions from the Creative Help Lab , the second battery also failed to charge . I haven't found the help lab all that " helpful , " either .. mainly an overall lack of understanding the problem we stated and the troubleshooting measures we had already taken .  
1	  This unit is being sold by a company that refuses to honor the rebate that they are using to push their product . In addition to the poor customer service , some components of the unit are poorly made and frequently arrive broken in shipping . The maps that come with the unit are poor at best , and the device itself often causes the PDA to which it is connected to reboot sponataneously . While not fully documented at this time ( investigations are ongoing ) , the Navman has been purported to cause cancer in small animals and as such can be considered a danger to our precious environment . For the sake of all that is good in this world - Do not buy the Navman !  
2	  Last month I bought a 1080i HDTV and figured I would see if a HDMI cable was indeed better than the older composite cables . I already had a 1080i upcoverting DVD player , and both it and my new TV supported HDMI so I was all set . I came across this cable from Eforcity and was blown away at how much cheaper it was ! The store I bought my TV at wanted at least $ 30 for a HDMI cable , and some were even $ 90 ! I was skeptical and assumed the cable offered by Eforcity would perform poorly but was I wrong . I immediately noticed an improvement in the picture , and uncompressed DVDs are of excellent quality . I haven't had any problems with this cable whatsoever and highly recommend it , although it does have one little quirk . When I first turn on my DVD player , a green line goes across the screen and the speakers make a sound before the picture and audio begin transmitting from the DVD player , but I only see / hear this when turning the DVD player on and off , never during a movie . It 's hard to say if that is from the DVD player , the HDMI cable , my Olevia TV , or from HDMI cables in general . Regardless , this is a fantastic cable for the price .  
1	  I can find no way to give feedback that one of the items ordered was missing . It came late and only 1 of the 2 were included . There is no phone number only a circular & # 34 ; help & # 34 ; section that never tells how to ask or clarify . It is an expensive product that I will buy another way in the future so that I am not left holding nothing in my hand or in my printer . Bad job .  
2	  A great use for storing important files and other types of media . 60GB is a lot of space .  
2	  It 's a bit big for a desk fan , but that 's half the reason I love it . It 's also much sturdier that most fans I 've had .. GOOD STUFF  
1	  The GPS keeps taking me to the wrong route , despite being on the fastest time setting and even when there is barely any traffic on the freeway . Although this may be alright when you know the route but that really frustrates me . While traveling on a regular route , it directs me to take an exit which is actually the correct route but once I take that exit it starts recalculating for no apparent reason and directs me to another route then when I reset the GPS it re-directs me back to the route I was originally on taking me on and off the freeway when I can actually go straight to reach the destination . If you miss an exit , it recalculates and bring me back on the freeway and no detecting an alternative route to destination . I 'm not sure if it is just the GPS I bought was defected or it happens to all of the GPS for 360 .  
2	  I just received this power supply and it works ! There are two minor flaws ( in my opinion ) with this power supply : 1 ) No LED indicator showing that the power supply is plugged in . 2 ) The power cord is shorter than the original HP power cord . Neither of these two issues keep this item from working and at half the price of an HP branded replacement you can't go wrong .  
2	  I am a college student . I see tons of televisions . I also worked in an electronics store , so I know my stuff . This TV is wonderful . Why get this one instead of a Sony or Panasonic ? Because it is cheaper ! And it is worth it . The picture on the TV is obviously not as good as Sony , but it is very , very close . It has a much higher resolution than most other TV 's , including many Sony . I would say the only downside to this TV is the sound , while the speakers are quite good , they have a low bass potential , but after testing a few other TV 's in the local store , I found that it was a common problem . Bottom line - great picture ( High Definition with progressive scan ) , great TV , and its cheap !  
2	  Not sure if this is truly 100 full feet , but it is a REALLY big spool of it , and it is a nice gauge wire for the price .  
1	  This case does not fit the Nikon Coolpix 1000pj . It is small for that camera although they say it can fit it .  
2	  80 hours . 80 hours that you can fill up with whatever you can possibly come up with . It 's fantastic . As long as no one tells you who won , you can watch games in way less time , because you take out the commercials . If time is money , TiVo starts paying for itself right off the bat . You can set up a schedule and never miss anything you want to see again . Sometimes you get addicted to scheduling too much TV and watching it all the time , but at least you never get so bored late at night that you watch Three 's Company reruns or infomercials . Check it out in a store and get ready to want one .  
2	  The 4 feet cord is too short . But the price is cheaper than that I saw in CVS . No need to complain  
2	  I bought this to connect my router to my modem , and it 's been working great for years now . Network performance is solid , which is all you can ask for from a cable !  
1	  Worked great for a few months . Dropped it on the floor once and now it 's all done .  
1	  My experience with this product was less than satisfactory . I installed it on an XP machine according to the instructions . It led to error messages and the creation of an LPT3 port which was " unusable " . It did create COM4 and COM5 which is what I would have expected . However , my machine came to a grinding halt , would hand indefinitely on startup . I did a system restored and reinstalled the PCI board . Same thing . Perhaps I got a lemon so I will exchange it . Clearly the other reviewers here had a more positive experience .  
1	  This is definitely one of the most cheaply priced 15 ' USB cables on the market . Now that I 've opened the plastic wrap , I now know that this is also the thinnest USB cable that I 've ever seen . This makes me wonder about the quality and whether it 's actually going to support reliable USB 2.0 speeds , especially in an environment with interference . I 'm only giving this two stars because I think that the product page should have been honest and explicitly said something about the thinness of the cable . I certainly didn't lose much money , but I wouldn't buy this again , and I 'll probably replace it with a thicker cable from a better known company . You get what you pay for .  
1	  I CHOSE THIS COFFEE MAKER AFTER READING REVIEWS ON MANY DIFFERENT BRANDS . I THOUGHT THE POSITIVE REVIEWS AND THE REASONABLE PRICE MADE THIS THE POT FOR US . HOWEVER I WAS WRONG . AFTER USING THIS POT TWICE IT QUIT WORKING . I CONTACTED PRESTO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS TOLD TO RETURN ( AT MY EXPENSE ) THE COFFEEMAKER . AFTER ABOUT 1 WEEK AND NO WORD I E-MAILED AND ASKED FOR VERIFICATION THAT IT HAD BEEN RECIEVED AND WHEN TO EXPECT A NEW ONE . I AM BEING TOLD THAT IT MAY BE 2 TO 3 WEEKS BEFORE THEY WILL HAVE THE PAPERWORK TO EVEN KNOW IF THEY HAVE THE POT AND MAYBE WEEKS BEFORE A REPLACEMENT WILL BE SENT . LONG STORY SHORT-I AM GOING TO WAL MART AND BUY A GE PERCOLATOR BEFORE I WAIT A MONTH FOR THIS ONE . AT LEAST IF IT DOESN'T WORK I CAN RETURN IT AND I WONT ' HAVE TO DEAL WITH A CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT . THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE .  
2	  Pros : DD-WRT and Tomato compatible . If you do not know what they are , google it and spend some time reading up on it . USB port , great for sharing printers and HDDs on your home wireless networkBy far the easiest router to install Tomato on ( from wikibooks ) : 1 . If the device has OEM firmware version 3 . x or later , then you need to revert it to a pre-3 . x version , first . 2 . Downloading and unpack the " ND " version of Tomato firmware , rename the file to " WL520gu_2.0.0.9_EN . trx " . 3 . Use the OEM menus to update the firmware with the renamed Tomato file . Cons : OEM Firmware is terribleNeed to use CUPS drivers for Mac and / or Unix / Linux peopleRouter runs slow every once in awhileOEM router is terrible . UI looks like crap and and it runs like crap . USB printing was spoty and the router internet connection would drop every 5 mins with the Asus FW . Most people who bought this router bought it for its DD-WRT capabilities and the USB port . If you do not plan to flash it , go find another router that is more stable . Once flashed , however , this router is just amazing . It does what ever you want with DDWRT , Tomato or any other open firmware . You can share the USB port over your network . I usually share a laser printer on it , and I am able to print whereever I want in my house . USB HDD 's work too if you want to have a networked drive . The only real downside is that if you do use it as a print server with Macs , make sure the drivers are CUPS drivers . Build quality is ok for the router , its not heavy and doesnt feel substantial . Antenna is removable . There are slots on the bottom for wall mounting . Bottom line , this is a great router for the price to convert in a super router if youre willing to spend 5 mins reflashing the firmware .  
2	  Easy installation and works like a champ . Saves money as cable Internet company was charging for rental of same .  
2	  They wires covers need to be thicker and the plastic black plastic post that 's inside each ear foam needs to be glued to the speaker portion , but all in all an affordable earphone for bass lovers that produces nice sound once you figure out the proper placement in the ear . You won't have a hissy if you have to replace them , so their good for non-car commuters . I prefer these to the white Sparkplug model . Less conspicuous . Otherwise it is the ABSOLUTE SAME THING . It would be nice if they were available in matte black ..  
1	  After 3 weeks of use the face of my Creative Zen has small circular scratches all over the face - except on the screen which does not contact this case ! My Zen M is now in much worse condition than if I had simply used the pouch that came with it .  
2	  Compact , simple to use camera . For the price it comes packed with features - easy transfer of pics to PC using USB cable . Excellent picture quality when used at best Pixel setting - 20 pics with original 16MB XD memory card . Not used the movie mode - own a camcorder . I invested in a rechargeable Li-Ion CR-V3 battery pack ( yes ! now available as rechargeables ) , much better life / performance than even the higest rated rechargeable NiMH - not very expensive given its performance , available on Amazon for $ 31 ( I bought my Li-Ion battery pack from Buy . com at $ 29.50 ) .  
2	  I NEEDED A DRUM UNIT FOR MY FAX MACHINE AND FOUND IT ON AMAZON . COM AT A VERY GOOD PRICE .  
1	  Bought it today and ran it for an less than an hour before it clogged up . Took it down and blew out the dead bugs . Plug it back in and within 15 minutes it clogged up again . This time while I was unclogging the screen the dang bulb dropped out and shattered . Now I have to buy a $ 15 bulb just to return this piece of junk which I will tomorrow .  
1	  These sound very flat . The bass is good , but everything else just sounds flat . Many other reviews have stressed this , but I figured maybe they were just being picky . They were not . If you want to listen to anything other than bass heavy music , don't buy these . Also mine didn't come with the airplane adapter , unless they no longer ship with it .  
2	  I use this headset in my office for long hourly workdays talking on the phone . This is my second one . The first one lasted over 5 yearsWhat I like .. 1 . It doesn't hurt my ear2 . It 's easy to put on & take off3 . The sound quality is excellent4 . People I have asked say they can hear me loud and clear5 . It is very reasonably priced and performs like a much more expensive headsetWhat I don't like .. 1 . Nothing , I can find no fault in this productI think this is the headset to own and hope when this one dies Plantronics is still selling these because I will buy another .  
1	  I bought the $ 20 phone card and am dissatisfied . Because only payphones were available , the toll-free access number had to be used . Using the toll-free access to a local land line to leave an answering machine message of less than 2 minutes ( probably closer to 1 minute ) caused the phone card to drop from 6 hours to 4 hours and 45 minutes . That 's ridiculous . It should not cost 1 hour and 15 minutes to leave a message on an answering machine . I would not buy this card again nor would I recommend this card to anyone else . I am very disappointed in this product .  
2	  My husband and I just purchased the ViewSonic VX800 and we love it . The sleek lines of the monitor , easy installation , and beautiful color make this a wonderful choice for anyone looking to upgrade from a CRT to an LCD . The speakers aren't bad either . They don't have the depth and richness of stand-alones , but again , they 're not bad for windows and web use .  
2	  I bought it to laminate my Medicare card worked well . I plan on using it for some photos I want to carry in my wallet as well .  
2	  just what I needed for my mum and dad for them to be safer in the house . Both have mobility issues - so this gives them some peace of mind  
1	  My Go 510 worked for only 1 plus weeks and had to be returned to TomTom for repair or replacement . I am very unhappy with the purchase . Ralph  
2	  I purchased this antenna for my new lcd hdtv and it works pretty well . I had been using an RCA antenna with the regular rabbit ears and loop . However this one seems to give me a better signal . I did pick up one additional digital signal when using this unit .  
2	  Have had these on 3 lens caps for several months . So far , I have had no problem with them . The elastic ring fits well around all of my lenses and the adhesive has stayed on even in extreme heat . The only down side I can see is that it leaves the lens cap swinging and I have yet to figure a way to keep it secured out of the way . BUT , I have not misplaced one since attaching these .  
2	  I ordered this for my work computer . It works very well if there is a lot of ambient lighting . When I first get to the office and it 's still dark outside , you can see the screen from almost any angle . Once the sun is up , it is very effective . I don't like the cheap plastic stick on mounting . A frame or something more durable would be ideal .  
1	  Thia was supposed to be a portable mp3 player but it wouldn't work unless it was charging  
2	  When it comes to optical gear , I always prefer to go to shop and check everything by hand and eye , on actual camera . So , I went to shop to check this lens . I liked it , but all of 3 exemplars I 've tested , had noticeable vignetting on both wide and tele end . It is especially noticeable when filming uniformly colored objects . Generally , all lenses do vignetting and Sony camera firmware has internal correction for that , but it only " knows " sony lenses , so in case with Tamron , you 'd have to correct vigneting in post production . Overall , this lens is very sharp , and great improvement over the standard kit lens in terms of image quality . The image is a bit soft on wide end and open aperture ( still better than kit lens ) , and tack sharp at tele end even at fully open aperture ! So , it is not a great general use zoom lens , but also can be used for portraits at tele end . Another notice - since it has no built in motor , focusing is done via camera , and is a bit slow and noisy , making this lens less usable for Video . You also should note that , when filming the video , Sony AF system will set F number to 3.5 , regardless of your presets , so if you plan to buy this lens to get more light for video shooting , that won't help .  
2	  I 've had the camera for 11 months taken hundreds of wonderful pictures . Then one day the camera was in my daughters purse and the LCD suddently appeard broken ( no physical sign of abuse ) but it had turned white with purple feathering on the screen ( internal damage of some sort ) . I read about others having difficulties with service of LCD 's from Canon so I thought I share mine recent experience . First I want to say that Canon was EXCELLENT about handling the return / repair . I called their service center and they told me where to send it , never was a cost mentioned . Sent camera w / store receipt and warranty card ; 7 days later had letter from Canon stating camera had been received and their diagnosis was a cracked LCD ( caused by pressure ) . The very next day I had camera delivered at my door by Fed-Ex , only 8 days after I 'd sent it to them . I could not be happier with their service . Maybe they 've heard and recognize a screen problem and that are now dealing with it in the professional manner the should have originally . In any case , have my wonderful little camera back , good as new . Happy with Canon and their service / support . Now wanting the sweet SD550 .  
2	  This bag is essential for photographers who carry more than one camera or lens . Adjustable compartments , plenty of pocket space , comfortable arm straps . Perfect . I carry 3 cameras , 2 lenses , film , and have room to spare in this bag . It 's great and having a backpack to go hiking , etc while taking pictures .  
2	  This backpack was exactly what I was looking for . I have a laptop with an 18.1 inch screen and could not find a decent backpack for under $ 100 . Other places had them but I didn't like them at all , it was even hard to find in google . I am very glad that Amazon had it so I took a risk and purchase it because it said it only supported up to a 17 inch screen . Once I got it I loved how it felt , how the zippers worked , and even how it looked . I use this bag everyday and have not had any problems with it . It holds my laptop comfortably and I couldn't be happier , plus the price was great . If you need a bag for an 18 " + laptop , this is the one to get .  
1	  I 've bought hundreds of Memorex CD-Rs over the past couple years , and I was always happy with the quality . However , they changed their product late last year , and the new ones just aren't of the same quality as the old ones . The new ones come in a purple shrink wrapped package . I never had one coaster with the old ones , but I 've been getting quite a few bad ones while using these new Memorex CD-Rs . So much so that I 'm no longer putting anything important on them . I 'm just using them for music mixes and the like . I 'd suggest finding another brand of CD-Rs . Which is what I 've done . Because the quality just isn't there anymore . It 's also twice as bad because the cost of these has gone up too !  
1	  DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF " POOP " Like others says this thing dosen't fit on the car they specified and theres no way to make it fit . Trust me I 'm been a system installer for more that 10 years now and I have never seen a soo useless piece of plastic on my life , and even WORSE ! Amazon is backing up this thing ! . It seems like it 's just a black plastic frame that you install on top of your preinstalled estero and it just to cover some openings around it , It dosen't have any means to hold or secure your stero so the stereo has to be bolted or secured by other means to your car 's dashboard . Ohh and I almost forgot ! .. it also have a very thin pocket under of the unit , and it 's made of cheap plastic . SincerelyA very desapointed Amazon customer .  
2	  Seemed a bit hard to program but , it is simple to install and works great ! . The cost of a Sears unit was $ 55.00 .  
2	  After doing some research , especially on ww . ilounge . com , I decided the XtremeMac Airplay Transmitter would be easier to use than its predecessor the iTrip . I 've been using Airplay regularly at home and in my car , it 's worked very well . It is important to find a clear channel and as other reviewers note , not turn your iPod up beyound 75 % volume . I don't live in a congested area , so I can't say how it will work there , but give Airplay a try !  
2	  Very easy to use and set up , you will know it is working by the beep it makes every 15 seconds or so . Inside the beep seemed a little loud so I wondered if we would hear it inside once I set it up outside . Did not hear the beep at all inside once I set it up outside . When you are close you do hear the beep but it is not to loud . We have a small garden that we use it for , well within the recommended dimensions . I buried it to where the solar panel was only a couple of inches above the ground . If you dig a hole to bury the unit make sure you pack the dirt , this will help convey the sound waves through the ground . Covered the mole holes every day and after about a week they did not come back . But wait , after a few days the holes were back , so apparently the moles came back hoping the annoyance had gone away . I was disappointed but decided to give it a little more time . Again covered the holes every day for about a week and then the holes disappeared again but this time for good ! Overall it took about three weeks to get rid of the moles permanently . It has now been two months and they have not come back . Also appears to have had some effect on the larger pests but that was not my concern because of the small 18 inch high fence we have around the garden . If moles are your problem it worked for us . Recommended .  
2	  If you 're looking for an inexpensive recorder with basic control this will fit your needs .  
1	  I got this camera yesterday . Picture quality very poor even in bright light . Forget about picture quality in indoor . Even webcam quality is not good . I have bought Micro Innovations webcam for [ money ] and it has much better quality than this one . I thought this one will have better quality .. I strongly recommend you not to buy this webcam .  
2	  After nearly 3 months of research , I convinced myself that this camera was the best choice out of all the options I had considered . I had been a digital camera user for about 3 years , just using point and shoot cameras . This camera ( along with other super zooms ) is a good way to graduate between traditional point-and-shoot cameras and dSLR cameras . Ironically , this model camera happens to be the cheapest along with the one with the best reviews and most features . The Canon S3 seems to be the typical consumer choice , yet this camera has a very odd form factor , and once I picked it up I knew it wasn't right for me . The interface on the software side was confusing and far too " dumbed-down " for me . Some test images at the store came out with a fair amount of noise , which is ironic due to the fact that all the camera gurus complain about the extreme noise on this camera . The noise on this camera is there , but not as noticeable as some reviewers make it sound . To put it into perspective , the noise levels are basically viewable in anything above a 11x14 print . Picture quality is strong in nearly all modes , and when you don't know what to use , there is usually a scene mode that will take care of it . Of course , you can always enter Simple Mode , something I personally have never tried , but how bad could it be . In respect to the features of this camera , the form factor , to start out , is amazing . Although it may not look like much , the camera can easily be held with one hand by someone with small hands like myself or large ones like those of my father . On the backside , there is the huge 2.5 inch LCD screen ( once again complained about by pro reviewers as not sharp enough , wrong again ) . Also , a simple set of navigational arrows , a trash button , the EVF , power switch , flash pop button , and a unique joystick that gives you access to all manual controls while in manual modes . The joystick is really great , allowing access to all the manual features whenever I need them . The 12x Optical Zoom is truly amazing , I can sit in my room and zoom so far with such great clarity that my camera can read things that I can't , and I have vision that is far above average . The Leica lens is obviously crafted beautifully , like that of the $ 4000 cameras that Leica makes . This camera allows a great deal of diversity for experienced users , while also offering options for those who are not as experienced . I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who might want to get closer to the shot with the huge zoom or wants to graduate from point and shoot cameras .  
2	  I love this camera .. almost as much as my digital one ! grin .. about 6 months ago I upgraded to this camera from an AE-1 program I have had since the 80 's .. yes high school .. I love this new rebel as much as my old camera and love the advanced features available on it .. it has a variety of accessories available for it and takes great pictures under almost any circumstance .. as well as has many built in features so that even an amateur can get great shots ..  
2	  I must admit that I was skeptical when I first ordered the DB2 . I live about 20 miles from most TV towers and the old rabbit ears didn't work very well in the basement . I tried this out and WOW , 24 channels are showing up on my HDTV . All local HD channels ( ABC , FOX , CBS , PBS , NBC , and TBS ) are there , and signals are seamless and clear . Although it 's not truely mutli-directional , I found it 's much less direction sensitive than the rabbit ears . I even not put it in a high place but I don't have to . I just hang it outside the basement and it continously receives clear HDTV signals . A well spent $ 40 and thanks Amazon in selling this great antenna .  
1	  I just received mine today , first of all I never had notice of the shipment and when I looked at that I cancelled my order , and suddenly I receive the call of my PO BOX to pick up my package ( whit out any notice of the shipper ) .. so , it was OK until I installed , the CD reader doesn't work at all , I can't play any CD ! So , I don't recommend anyone to buy anything from this seller . Then , I notice that it had an Amazon Warranty , but I 'm outside of US so , I had to repair it domestically , and who is going to pay me back ? Nobody ! I really disappointed . I would never buy again this way !  
1	  This DVD player will not work with monitors it thinks are non-HDCP monitors . I connected the DVI cable to my 2006 Sceptre LCD monitor that is supposed to be HDCP compliant . The DVD plays a few seconds of the DVD in the background , and even gets to the menu screen , then says ' non-HDCP compliant device ' and goes to white snow / fuzz . [ HDCP is the movie version of DRM - only stupider . ONLY pirated DVDs will play with this type of ' protection ' . ]  
2	  I purchased these speakers for use with an iPod Touch 4G and I couldn't be more pleased ! They sound great and work fine as a recharging station even without listening . I 'm going to get a couple more sets for use in other buildings on the property . When away from an outlet , battery life is pretty short , and the music quality suffers mightily as the batteries weaken , but I don't often listen to music outdoors , so that doesn't matter to me . They 'll work well for an afternoon of weed-pulling in the garden once in a while , anyway . :-)  
1	  Product would not write / produced write error with my PC and several others . Compatibility should have been fine as other DVDs burn fine . I may have gotten a bad batch . Of note , if you buy try them out quickly as the return window is limited .  
2	  I got mine on Ebay so I got it for a little less than retail . I opened it and put a CD in I had burned using Nero . It was some OTR ( Old Time Radio ) shows . It just skipped all over the CD unable to play it . BUT .. I got a blank CD out took the CD and converted all the shows to 128Kbps instead of the 32kbps they were coded at . I turned Juliet off and made sure I Closed the CD . It runs great ! Never skips . I wish it would show the title of the item playing but for the price it is worth it . I totally recommend it to anyone wanting an affordable MP3 , CD player . I see that plate people have been talking about scratching their CDs and I can only think maybe they have a screw loose . No I mean it . Maybe it is not the plate but a screw loose on the plate it the problem . The plate is very sturdy so I can see it bending by push the buttons unless you are using a hammer . I give it 4 stars simply because I think it would be nice to have titles . Greate Item .  
1	  It prints light on ink and leaves a streak on the side of the paper . OEM HP product does not do this in my past experience . I guess I get what I pay for ..  
2	  It was a gift to my grandson . No complaints so far . Robert H  
1	  Easy set up , worked great , for a little while . After a very short period , it just stopped working . Maybe it was just the one I bought , but I was very unhappy , especially since a fight ensued about who was going to replace it ( Still unresolved ) An update : After several months of arguing about whether the failure was software or a hardware issue , Microsoft finally agreed to replace the adapter . Of course I had already bought another from a different company , and they wouldn't simply refund the purchase price . The one I have works fine , so I haven't installed the replacement adapter and can't say if it works any better .  
2	  arrived quickly , considering that storms had closed most of the commerce in the U.S.works great and easy to use  
1	  Opened the box , popped it in the printer , chose " color " under printing preferences since I finally had my new cartridge , clicked " print " , and then .. NOTHING ! A blank page . Over and over . Even had the computer whiz in my office try to work with it . An absolutely useless cartridge . I 'll be waiting for my replacement before I contact amazon .

1	  To start , to turn it on , the instruction manual says to push the power button " for a few seconds " . I 've never had it come on in fewer than 15 seconds , and it often takes 30 or more . That 's 30 seconds of sitting there like an idiot holding your finger on the button , wondering if the thing is actually defective . Have you ever even HEARD of an electronic device taking that long ? Would it kill them to install a simple on-off switch instead ? The 5 operating buttons on the back are identically shaped ( except for the round power button ) . This makes it difficult to use since you have to look at the front of the screen and feel for the buttons , usually hitting the wrong one . You end up having to turn the frame over and back many times to go through the menu and make your selections . It 's understandable that they 'd put the buttons on the back , given it 's intended use as a wall hanging , it just would have been more user friendly if they varied the size and shape of the buttons , or their location , so you could distinguish one from another without having to visually confirm it . The manual says that you can download files directly from your PC to the photo frame using a ( not supplied ) USB cord and a somewhat fussy procedure . I tried this and it didn't work . I ended up downloading my picture files using the same compact flashcard reader I use to download the files from my camera to my PC , and then inserting the card into the photo frame . If you load directly from your camera to your PC you might have a problem . So far , I haven't had the problem identified in one review of having the compact flash card fall through the opening to loosely rattle inside the device , but after reading that and checking the unit , the writer is right . It would be easy to do , and a major pain . You do have to be careful . The menu gives you the options of randomly choosing picture files to display and whether or not to repeat them . It doesn't give you the option of viewing them in chronological or filename order . Because most cameras name photo files with a numbering system , you assume that the computer chip would default to showing them in that order . That 's not how this device works . It may be a result of how the computer saves the files to the memory card , but it doesn't display the files in the order they appeared on your PC when you downloaded them . That may not be a problem in some cases , but will be in others . Potential buyers should give some consideration to the orientation of the photo 's they may display ( portrait vs . landscape ) . By default , portrait oriented photo 's are displayed in landscape format , greatly reducing their size and adding some distortion . The software allows portrait formatted photos to be changed to display in full screen , but it 's an 8 step process requiring the aggravating back and forth motion described above and it often doesn't work . It 's much easier to do it on your PC ( a fact the manual points out ) . Mixing the two formats is not advised if you intend to hang the frame or display it on a table . A related enhancement would be to give you the option of displaying all portrait oriented photo 's and then the landscape oriented ones , although this would only be useful for hand held viewing . If you regularly mix the orientation of your photos , this might be an issue for you . The MosaicView is hardly the " exciting new technology " lauded in the manual , but rather a minor obstacle most users will choose to ignore . After all , why pay a premium price to buy a photo frame with a larger screen , only to display images at a quarter of that size ? MosaicView makes the orientation problem even worse because it packs 4 photos on the screen , which just squeezes and distorts the portrait files even more . The stand that attaches to the frame is easy and convenient for landscape view , but a pain to convert to portrait . Instead of integrating that option into the design , you have to remove 4 teeny tiny screws , turn part of the stand platform , and then replace the screws . Unless you routinely carry a jewelers screwdriver , plan on at least a 10-minute job . The power cord is 6 feet long , making it just long enough to reach from your average wall socket straight up the wall for an average height viewer . A few more feet would cost next to nothing and at least give you the option of trying to hide the cord behind a curtain or the woodwork as it works its way up your wall , or alternatively , to pass the frame from person to person while sitting in your living room . After using this thing for a couple weeks , my biggest gripe is that I think the designers really missed the boat on what could be the best use of this product , which is as a hand held picture viewer . IMHO , what this country needs is an easy way to share digital pictures when you 're not sitting at a computer . I 'd hoped that I could use this as a replacement to prints in informal settings . I thought that at work , in a restaurant , or when I have friends over and want to pass around my latest vacation photo 's , I 'd be able to pass it from person to person , letting them advance each frame by pushing a button . While you can do that with practice , the power cord and button location makes this pretty inconvenient . If this thing was battery operated and had more user-friendly operating buttons , I think the market would recognize it as the final link in the digital loop , a convenient way to carry and show your digital photos . For those that feel my criticism is misplaced because it focuses on a use not intended by the manufacturer , you 're right . If all you want to do is hang this device on the wall and forget about it , these concerns probably won't be much of a drawback . To be fair , the screen delivers very acceptable sharpness at a resolution of 800 x 400 and the small size of the files required at that resolution mean you can pack a lot of pictures onto a pretty inexpensive memory card ( one caveat noted below ) . That capacity is poorly matched to the software 's navigation system however , which requires you to move through each picture one at a time if you want to save a picture to the internal memory ( on the other hand , the manual gives no reason why you 'd want to do that , so most people won't bother ) . In the final analysis , I think most users will want greater flexibility to use this device as a portable photo album . If that 's important to you , you should think about waiting for the next generation . One final note : For users of compact flash cards , a word of advice . The quality of the card makes a difference ! I first tried an old Kodak 16MB card because it was large enough to handle the 200 pictures I wanted to view after I saved them to an 800 x 400 resolution , but I noticed distinct digital artifacts making squared lines in circle or wave patterns through what should 've been a smooth transition of color in many pictures . At first I thought it was a reflection of the 800 x 400 screen resolution , but after switching to a 1GB Sandisk card , the problem went away . This probably goes for other types of memory cards as well .  
2	  Out of the box , the picture looks good but fine tune it with Video Essentials and you 'll be even more impressed . Colors are unmatched to any HDTV that I 've seen in this size so far . Black levels are good . Even though I use external speakers , the sound is very good . SD card plug in the front is a very nice feature . I bought this on black Friday for $ 1279 so I 'm sure the prices will come back down to that very soon . Although the power required to operate this set is pretty high ( in comparison to others ) , I wouldn't choose any other 1080i set .  
1	  I liked the printer fine - wasn't delighted with it , but wasn't terribly unhappy either - until I upgraded my MacBook to Mac OS X. Then I find out , unfortunately , that HP does not support full functionality for this printer under Mac OS X , and I 'm far from the only one unhappy with this situation , and HP has refused to update the printer driver for provide full functionality . ( See [ & # 8230 ;] ) for just one forum for the complaints . As a result , I would not buy this or any other HP printer again . I just can't count on it the software being updated for a decent length of time .  
2	  These speakers give truly high definition audio . Being THX certified , its no surprise . The sub-woofer is hyperactive so I keep it at one level above minimum and it blends in perfectly with the sound . The sound card connecters are not very good and at the first shot I ended up getting sound only from 3 speakers and the subwoofer . Then after pressing the connectors in harder they clicked properly into place and the sound was perfect . I 've read some reviews online that state that these speakers emit a hissing sound even when not being used . I was able to get rid of that problem by using lower impedance cables from the sub-woofer to the speakers . Also , using optical connection makes the music sound way better . To give you some idea of the power of the speakers , let me tell you this - I live on the first floor of my building and have a friend who 's on the fourth floor . I was able to wake him up from sleep just by turning the volume to 3/4th the full . He thought there was an earthquake . Now that 's something really amazing .  
2	  We were having trouble getting over the air channels with the cheap little rabbit ears we had hooked up to our new HDTV . We bought this and an antenna mount and attached it to our satellite dish and now we get all the channels in crystal clear . Well worth the money we spent .  
2	  I have always just listened to the " ear buds " or head phones that came with the device I had bought , not any more . These give a much better sound than I had expected . I will use them for a ton of my around the house chores as well as while at work . I used them while cutting wood and the roar of a chainsaw was but a little hum while listening to my Ipod . Very nice purchase considering I used my Pesistuff points . I would recomend them to anyone who can't afford the higher priced head phones . GREAT DEAL for the bucks !  
2	  This was a fathers day gifts and my husband was amazed at the quality of the sounds . He was very pleased and has down loaded a lot of songs on it .  
2	  I needed a short CAT5 cable to connect my router to my cable modem . This one foot cable worked perfectly , as the router is right next to the modem . I did not want to bundle up a longer cable for this very short run . I have all the tools , testers , connectors and wire to make up my own patch cables , but for $ 2 a piece , it was easier to just order a few of these cables . They worked just fine when I received them and plugged them in .

2	  I just bought another DLK 8000 battery ( Replacement for Kodak KLIC 8000 ) because I was so happy with the first one . This fits in my Kodak digital camera model 1012IS . This camera model is not listed with the other advertised models that take this battery , but rest assured if you own the 1012IS , this is the battery you need . Maybe the 1012IS is too new of a model to be listed ? But anyway , I bought the battery with the Power 2000 RTC-148 charger . Both were a fourth the cost of the Kodak brand , and both work great . This battery fits perfectly in both the charger and the camera . It is NOT too tight as some people stated for another camera model .  
1	  but after sending back the first one for a buzz in the speaker , my second one has the same thing ! Unusable !  
2	  This camera is perfect for the ' In-between ' user-the one who wants more capability than the small handheld pocket ones , but doesn't want to pay the $ 600-$1,200 price for the full up large digitials . The optical zoom is perfect-don't let any sales person sell you on a digital zoom-it is NOT the same , nor even close . Easy to use , tremendous pictures .  
2	  This is number two for us . Two adults and two teens have used this mouse ( and it 's predecessor ) for daily purposes for more than 6 yrs . The only reason we 've had two is the cable on the first one ( on the mouse end ) just couldn't last beyond 6 yrs . The mechanism in the mouse is still completely functional ( and the cable will get repaired as soon as time permits ) .  
1	  I got this two Christmas 's ago . Even though iTunes can be temperamental I loved having this ! I primarily used it when I went to work out . One day , I 'm at the gym and I turned it off for a couple minutes to talk to someone . I go to turn it back on and two lights just flash back and forth . Then iTunes doesn't even recognize it ! It says it needs to be restored . So I clicked " restore " and then it says it 's unable to restore due to an " unknown error . " I look into sending it to Apple to get it fixed but it would cost as much to buy a new one as it would to get it fixed ! I just couldn't believe it was go kaput just like that . Not to mention Apple 's has the worst navigation on it 's website .. you have to click through seven pages just to get a simple question answered !  
2	  * Extremely user friendly , it took me about an hour of toying aroung with the camera to learn how to use just about everything on it . * Crisp clear pictures , able to get great pictures of things even just a couple of inches from the lense . * Functions Operate very quickly * hardy and durable camera * Able to customize many features * Able to edit images right in camera * Included software is also easy to use and full of features * Able to view LCD from all angles * LCD not great in direct sunlight * Buttons easy to navigate * 3x zoom is not much  
2	  the product is a very good product . it was delivered in a timely manner . would buy another . i have had no problems with this purchase . i would reccomend this to a friend .  
1	  I bought this product because of the nice reviews it had . I am disappointed . My husband has a TomTom One ( a much cheaper product ) and his device has much more planning options - like navigate to recent destination , points of interest near current position , along route and near destination . It 's also easier to put in a new address since it recognizes the street names much faster - it pulls a list only after you type 2 letters . On the display the TomTom ( unlike Garmin ) also shows how many more miles you have left to destination , current speed and time - these are nice features I don't want missing . Both Garmin and TomTom have estimated arrival time and distance to next turn . The only thing I like about the Garmin is the text to speech but that 's pretty much it . I wouldn't buy it again .  
2	  I purchased the B + W filter to protect a 50mm lens that I use on my Leica M9Leica M9 18MP Digital Range Finder Camera ( Steel Gray , Body Only ) , and although there are less expensive filters available , I wanted a quality filter from a reputable company . The light constituting the photo that you envision has to pass through all of the glass contained in the lens and the filter before reaching the camera 's film or sensor , and this filter does its job : it protects without diminishing the quality of the image . I highly recommend it .  
1	  I 've owned a Kaito KA1103 for over a year . It has been one of the most exasperating purchases I 've ever made . To begin with , its AC adapter failed after about a week . To Kaito 's credit , they replaced it ; but to their discredit , the replacement adapter was Dead On Arrival and has never worked . So I started operating the KA1103 on batteries . Unfortunately , in the KA1103 a set of four AA cells lasts only 3 to 4 weeks , even when used no more than 1 or 2 hours a day , at most . And , aside from the rapid battery consumption , the KA1103 's controls are confusing and inconvenient . Finally , about a month ago , just over a year since I bought the radio , it completely quit working . I 've just replaced it with a Sangean ATS 606A , which I hope will do better  
2	  I got this DVD Player for Father 's Day and I really wasn't sure if I wanted it . My wife encouraged me to hook it up and it turns out it is much easier to use than a VCR . We have watched five different movies and I can't imagine going back to video cassettes . It also plays CDs which I wasn't aware of before . The buttons on the remote are a little small but other than that it is very easy to use .  
1	  The lens arrived packaged in the box . Took it out and put on my rebel . The manual focus ring initially moves smoothly then gets kinda stuck along the way and at the long end gives again producing a jerky and unpleasant effect . In auto focus there 's a grinding sound as if there 's sand in the mechanism and it does not focus fast . I was able to take a few pictures but the problems w / both manual and auto focus is not what you 'd expect from a 1000 $ lens . I returned it .  
1	  Sent item back to the company and got a rejected mail saying , " COMPANY OUT OF BUSINESS , RETURN TO SENDER " . The company address on the label is : Recoton Accessories , Inc . 2950 Lake Emma RoadLake Mary , FL 32746 . Made in China  
1	  The belt on the turntable had to be installed , but it still did not work . The motor was not operational . The manufacturer offered to have it picked up . They have but I have yet to receive it back . Hopefully it will work then ..  
2	  This tyke of a radio by Koss sure comes with clear sound . Both AM and FM bands have strong receptions to radio stations . I love using it when I go biking and jogging .  
1	  Hi , I purchased the Toshiba SD-V290 DVD / VCR Combo for $ 136.94 on8/27/03 . It is now 1/4/04 . It broke this week . Less than four months of proper use . When I put a VHS tape into the machine it is automatically ejected . Therefore I can not play VHS tapes at this time . When playing a DVD there are pauses throughout playback . Now I have to deal with calling support and probably paying to send this machine in for service . Then I believe I 'll be going through the following process throughout the remainder of the warranty . First I 'll return the machine to Toshiba . Then Toshiba will repair it . Next , Toshiba will return it to me . Then I 'll use it . At some point it will stop working again . Finally , I 'll send it back to Toshiba for repair . Then Toshiba will repair it .. I can see this going go on for the life of the warranty . This adds up to a lot of time and aggravation . Stay away from this product . I believe this machine is poorly made . Poor parts , poor quality , and poor design .  
2	  Overall , I am very satisfied with the player . The battery life is great and it is really very small . I also find the FM radio to be a nice bonus , allowing you to listen to the radio if you get tired of the music you pre-loaded . I also think it is great that they include the arm-band and belt clip for it , since some companies make you pay extra for this .  
2	  This product is truly a great product . The sound quality is superb due to it 's digital DIN output . I have a Soundblaster Live ! soundcard and the bass and treble are powerful and crisp . The four satellite speakers make the sounds produced more realistic and really enhances the EAX games . I would definitely recommend this product to gamers who don't have a huge budget .  
2	  I put it in my 07 ' taurus . My car came with a cassette deck , so I put a Metra 99-5717 Taurus / Sable 04-07 Dash kit in so I could listen to my CD 's . I also used a Pioneer DEH-1200MP CD Receiver with MP3 / WMA Playback and Remote Control . It was kind of a hastle running the wire harness back to the trunk , but all the color coded wires matched up perfect ! This kit also has the airbag light in it !  
2	  We live in Tornado alley and this is a much have . This is located in our kitchen and is loud enough to wake us up from our bedroom . I know I can rely on this product and highly recommend this .  
1	  I recently bought eleven Cisco871s for remote locations and a Cisco 2901 as the termination point at my headquarters . Simple VPN configuration with everything coming back to my main site , even got a CCNP ( he also has CCVP , CCIP , CCDP , CS-CIPCCES , Security + , A + ) to configure them for me . I wasted two weeks of trying to get them working with the contractor before I got them working . The money I thought I was saving over buying an easy to configure Checkpoint or Sonicwall was quickly lost on the contractor , not to mention the pain of working on them for two weeks . I don't understand why Cisco thinks they need to make configuring a device so complicated . Plenty of other companies have figured out how to make and actual graphical interface that works . Even their fancy Cisco Configuration Professional I heard was so great is pathetic .  
2	  This is obviously made to work with Kodak-branded printer docks and camera docks , so don't buy this paper package if you don't own one or the other . That being said , I STRONGLY recommend getting this 160 package instead of the smaller packages because A ) it ends up being MUCH cheaper when you consider how many more pieces of photo paper and ink you get , and B ) even if you don't print a lot , you 'll use them all up sooner or later . It 's not like they expire , right ? And considering you get free shipping and no sales tax if you order it from Amazon , than the several dollars cheaper than Best Buy price sounds even sweeter !  
1	  Great looking , seems easy to use . But the one I got just didn't work ! had to send it back . you get what you pay for !  
1	  Not wanting to shell out $ 80 on a new mac adapter for my iBook G4 , I ordered this one instead . Bad idea . The adapter arrived in a clearly re-used ziplock bag . The plug was three pronged rather than two pronged , as it is in the photo on amazon . That , and it was broken on arrival-didn't manage to power my laptop . I 'm not sure if it 's the product or the company selling it , but my suggestion is not to bother with this . Thankfully , amazon made the return easy .  
1	  I had long been a fan of JBL audio , until now . These speakers have great sound for the size . However , the unit stopped charging the ipod on the second day . After a few weeks the volume control works only sporadically . The unit shipped without the remote , and a replacement was not provided despite sending in all the requested information .  
2	  it was really easy to set up . The fax , scanner and copier areall simppe to use . The software worked great with both themac and the pc in my house . Copy looks great as do the recent pix I printed  
2	  My receiver only has one optical input and I needed something that would let me hook up my Cable box , PlayStation 3 , and my computer . I found the Nyrius SW100 while searching though Amazon and it looked perfect for what I wanted . When it arrived I hooked everything up and it worked perfectly .. at first . I started noticing sound dropouts while watching the Cable box and assumed the new switch must have caused it . After much cable swapping and testing however , I found that the problem was actually in the output on the cable box . After getting the cable box replaced everything worked great . I 've had the SW100 for a month or so now and am very pleased with its performance . I haven't noticed any sound quality loss and have had no further troubles with sound dropouts . The only ' annoyance ' I really have is that I have to stand up and walk to the TV to turn the switch ; which , I admit , is more laziness on my part rather than a product defect . Perhaps some kind of remote switch could be added to a future model , but of course that would add yet another remote to the group I already have .. so perhaps not . Anyway , the SW100 is a great buy for the price and does exactly what it says it will do . I definitely recommend this product for people like me who need the extra optical inputs , but aren't quite ready to upgrade to a new receiver . * As a side-note , make sure you have an extra optical cable to run from the SW100 to your receiver along with the 3 that will go to your sources . I say this because I didn't even think about it and came up one cable short during my original hookup ; luckily I had an extra buried away .  
1	  I shouldn't have been this cheap .. do yourself a favor - stay away from these - no base , distorted sound . The only good thing I can think of after installing these - I am trained now , will buy and install better speakers fast and clean .  
2	  Doing business with this company was a pleasure . My ipod came promptly and was in great shape . Super quality , customer service , and product . I highly recommend purchasing ipods from this seller !  
2	  Great price and the memory works just fine . Make sure it is seated properly and firmly .  
1	  I bought 2 while I was in the US and unfortunately the do not fit in the in Germany and after I bought an adapter they did not work . Both did not deliver the correct voltage .  
1	  Sweat gets into it easily during exercising and eventually malfunctions even after drying up . Otherwise plays well , sleek look , great size .  
1	  I thought I would love this little alarm clock but after much time and use .. it just doesn't cut it . There are 3 settings for the backlight but still the lowest one is way too bright for sleeping comfortably . Additionally , I enjoy falling asleep to music and volume setting " 1 " - the lowest is WAY too loud for dozing off . Who in the heck engineered this thing ? It 's terrible !  
2	  I have this router since January 2009 . Initially I have bought it for a friend in 2008 and one year after , I have bought back the router to my friend ( 50 % cheaper than new , of course ! ) . The last time that I have powered off the router was 94 days ago and at this time the router never have had a crash or any problem . Of course , since the first day that I bought this router I have installed DD-WRT that brings stability and lots of functionality to the router . I have tested many Buffalo and Linksys 802.11N routers and the coverage is very poor compared with de WRT54GL , that is at least 40 % better than similar routers with 2 external antennas . If you want stability and you don't mind if it looks like an " old school " router this is the best router on earth for home and small business customers . I never have had to reset this router by a crash . Finally , if you want a Wireless N router I recomend that you first do a search on the DD-WRT database and confirm if the router that you want to buy is supported to install DD-WRT . Regards from Costa Rica .  
1	  My mom got this for my 5 year-old for his birthday . The main interest was that it is a camera , and of course it was a nice bonus that it had the " Cars " theme . It is absolute junk . We 're currently looking to see if there are any other kid-friendly cameras that will take a half-way decent picture in a similar price-range . You 'd be better off just bying a toy camera , at least there is no expectation that you 'd get a picture you could make out . If you 'd like to get your child another " Cars " toy , just get him / her a toy car . So far , I 'd say those are the only " Cars " toys we have that are well made ( assuming of course they don't have lead paint ) .  
1	  This unit stopped working after about 5 hours of use . It was never dropped or abused . Do not buy this unit !  
1	  We play a cd in our daughter 's room every night on repeat . This cd player had gotten questionable reviews but I went ahead with it . Big mistake . Lasted 3 months before the cd player burned out . We have an Insignia cd player that has lasted more than 1.5 yrs playing in another room . Shame on me for buying a cheaper one .  
1	  Form some reason these discs no longer work well with my burner . They did , at one time but as of late , do not . I wound up ordering Sony music cds .  
1	  A while ago I purchased the same item , maybe a month , and I received what I paid for : 2 walkie talkies , 2 RECHARGABLE BATTERIES , and a CHARGING BASE for the walkies . In this last purchase I thought I bought the same things , I even paid the same amount of money , but neither the batteries nor the charging came in the package . Thank youHumberto GonzalezSan Jose , Costa Rica  
1	  I couldn't see the difference in the picture quality , but there was a big problem for the sound . i have Yamaha RX-V2600 receiver and Toshiba HD DVD player . So , when i connected this cable from DVD player to the receiver , i just got 2.0 channel PCM signal no matter what i play ( DTS / DTS ES , Dolby Digital / Dolby Digital EX , Dolby TrueHD ) . On the other hand , when i switch to monster cable , i had no problem ; the receiiver was getting the same imput when playing DTS / ES , DD / EX , and MPCM ( 5.1 channel PCM ) when playing Dolby TrueHD , Dolby Digital Plus .  
2	  I bought these speakers for my portable DVD . Kids could not hear the DVD player in my van with the road and air conditioner noise . These speakers work great . Well worth the money .  
2	  The Sennheiser HD 205 is great value for money . The design is not only comfortable , but takes out a lot of ambient noise . This headphone does not have active noise reduction but does a good job with its closed design headphone . The right-side is able to swivel backwards , so you can answer a phone call and not need to remove the whole headphone . This swivel was designed for DJ 's to do sound mixing , but works well for other purposes as well . I also like its strong bass and great clarity , where I could hear sounds in music that I did not hear before . This headphones not only works well for music , but does great with your favourite action movie . You will hear how close the sound is , and have bullets whizzing past you and swords meeting like they are just around you . Below are the technical specifications : Acounstic principle : Dynamic , closedEar coupling : Supra-auralFrequency response : 14-20,000 HzMax SPL at 1kHz , 1 Vrms : 112 dBTHD at 1kHz , 100 dB SPL : < 0.5 % Impedance : 32 OhmsWeight ( without cable ) : 206 gSingnal cable : 3 m copper cable ( OFC ) , single-sidedConnector / adapter : 3.5 mm stereo jack with 6.3 mm adapterThis headphones comes with a 2 year warranty and a protective pouch for the headphones .  
2	  When I ordered my new stereo head unit for my car , I wanted to make the installation process easy . Being color blind , the last thing I wanted was to hassle over what color the wires were , trying to figure it out without someone 's help . This plug make it very simple . Once I received my head-unit , I was able to sit in my living-room and correct the wires from the head-unit plug to the wires that connect into the cars harness . I made good solid connections that won't short out on anything or come apart . Once I installed the head-unit and new speakers into my car , I reconnected my battery and turned on my new stereo . It worked perfectly , no problems what so ever . This plug fit perfect and the wires matched exactly in my Mitsubishi .  
2	  This was a God-send on a recent trip to Paris . We used one adapter for the plug and were able to then plug in all our electronic devices in one outlet . The cord is compact enough to keep in a computer bag and powered 2 laptops and 2 cell phones ! Great product .  
1	  I recently bought a tower fan from Bionaire . It looked pretty good in the store and was supposed to be quiet . It worked well for about a day and then got out of balance . I didn't even move the fan so I have no idea how it got out of balance . It is now two weeks old and it sounds like it is about to die . If I was selling a product that was this pathetic , I wouldn't put my company name on it .  
2	  Love it . Rated the highest in its cataegory and wasn't disappointed . Too bad HP !  
1	  Ink Easily Runs If Paper Gets Wet ! This is not the good stuff . The original ink does not easily run when the paper gets wet . Be aware ! Cannot read anything if the paper gets wet .  
1	  The camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand . Some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures . This camera 's randomly broke after about 1 year and I did not drop the camera . I bought a Sony PDA and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the front . Of course , Sony said it was my fault and that I must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that PDA . Since the camera was out of warranty , I knew there was nothing they were going to do . So if you want a decent camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it ! But if you want a great company to support their products , look somewhere else . I am not buying anymore Sony products - I have lost the love for Sony ! Beware !  
1	  This keyboard has been in my employ for one month , used daily for approximately ten hours . Two stars because it works , but with annoying kinks . No problems with the mouse , and the keyboard works ; all those extra toy $ on the keyboard are just that : toys , not useful tools . Mild connection problems in the beginning , but those were easily resolved with some fiddling . No problems with the included software except MediaLife . Below are my comments about each piece of this product . Media Pad on the left-hand side : The volume and zoom strips both require multiple strokes to make even small actual changes . The other touch controls either do not detect pressure when you do try or accidentally trigger from a stray , floating pinky while typing . The result is that you get multimedia software launching out of seemingly nowhere or your music stops .. both unneeded interruptions . You can't disable the Media Pad either , so get used to that annoyance . LCD display : Can use for built-in calculator function , otherwise the only text I 've ever seen on there is " NO CONNECTION " , " LOGITECH MX 5000 " or a crude bar graph for volume / zoom . Gimmicky useless item . Standard keys : Works just like a regular keyboard with some tactile feedback , nothing special . The small function keys will require mild re-training of your fingers . Still not entirely used to those , and it is a bit weird even after a month . MediaLife software : Do not install this . It is unclear to me where the " value " is in this added application . From what I can tell , it was just thrown in there to fill some sort of perceived offering void . And the # 1 most prevalently annoying thing about this keyboard : Rrrepeating keys after wake-up . Vvvery annoying , and no updates ( as of this date ) fix this problem !  
1	  The product included only a 3.5 inch floppy disk for the software download ! What a joke ! Who has floppy disks anymore ? Amazon wouldn't help me so I am struggling through with Panasonic trying to get the software on CD - what a pain !  
1	  The product , with no brand name , looked like what I used in my camera . After a shoot I went to remove the battery and could not get it to slide out . I ended up super glueing a piece of plastic to the end of the battery so I could pull it out of my camera . By the way camera is a Konica-Minolta A200 .  
1	  I was initially drawn to the My Book from Western Digital because of the size , price , and footprint . Unfortunately , I hadn't researched enough reviews from previous owners . After bringing the drive home , I plugged it into the computer and it loaded right up . I downloaded 6 or 7 gigs of important documents onto it , and went to bed . The next day it turned on once more , and then never again . After numerous e-mails to their tech department , I have yet to get a response . If the previous reviewer is right , ( and I 'm afraid he is ) , I 'll be lucky to get a replacement , and have no chance of getting my data back . With what I 've lost , it is the most expensive piece of computer equipment I 've ever bought .  
2	  Bag is nicer than I thought and holds our 17 " HP without any issues . The shoulder strap is comfortable too . We had been looking for a nice bag at a reasonable price for our laptop and our experience with lowepro for several camera bags help us with the decision to try this one out .  
2	  This is the best phone I have ever used . I use it for my work , I do customer service from home and have always had problems hearing . I do have a hearing loss , but with this phone I don't need it on maximum most of the time . If I can't hear someone I just increase up to maximum and I hear fine . I rarely need to ask for people to repeat any more .  
1	  This product has a lifespan of about one week . Either the cartridges are only partially filled ( very small to begin with ) , or the ink solidifies when air hits it . Lousy deal .  
2	  I like that Amazon gets me the codes I want without having to bother going to a store . Easy peasy .  
2	  I bought this after seeing them for way more at best buy . They are exactly the same and came the next day !  
1	  I bought these and after about 2 months of owning them I am down to the last one . The stylus don't fit so it flies out of the slot compared to the original stylus that came with it . I am going to try the OEM ones from UTC Starcomm to see if they work better and post a review .  
2	  Fantastic investment . It never steers us wrong . No pun intended . My wife and I invested in this product about a year ago and we 've traveled to different states and the maps are flat out PERFECT ! What 's really neat is that it has a feature to show where the state line is if you 're traveling long distances between states . It tells you exactly how long it 's going to take to get to your destination and will automatically adjust if you 're in traffic . It has different language sets , also . A plus , if you want to learn a few different ways to say " Turn Right in 500 feet . " LOLGreat overall !  
1	  I wanted to give this no stars , but it made me choose at least 1 . I also purchased this item for my 50 mile commute from Northern VA to Washington DC and Maryland . I have had it for 30 days now with no luck , and have run into the same issue as others . I 've spent a total of 8 hours on the phone with Magellan with no luck , I have had at a minimum 10 e-mail conversations again with no luck . The GPS works just fine , the unit is receiving the radio signal , but no traffic updates . Magellan has been avoiding this issue for over 30 days now and I cannot return the product for refund . I also asked Magellan if they would refund my money with no response . Don't buy this product .  
2	  I have been using this router for about 2 years now , since October 2008 . It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better . Good range & speed . I highly recommend .  
2	  I got tired of my Phillips , Sony and Memorex headphones . I wanted a good ( but affordable ) headphone set . I got these HD497s after a previous good experience with a smaller Sennheiser a few years back . At first - I was not impressed . The sounds came out clean and such but no " turbo boost " per se . Then I tried the same music cds with my Philips - I was shocked . I had been used to poor music quality because of usage with Philips and Sony headphones . The Sennheisers are great . Not good for portable ( read IPOD walking / running / outdoor ) but awesome for usage at home on your stereo or on your computer . Worth it at twice the price . Unbelieveable ranges and the same music Im discovering THE FULL RANGE OF SOUNDS !  
1	  When I attempted to install this cable , I got electrical arcs between the plug and terminal every time . There are scorch / weld marks on the cable and rear of my television now , and turning on my tv with it installed blows a fuse every time . This cable is going straight into the trash .  
1	  These headphones are kind of chintzy but they work okay . They are basically cheap earbuds with a thin metal loop soldered too the back to go around the ear . The Sony sport headphones provide much better sound quality and comfort ( these don't seem to fit as snugly ) . However , the Sony sport headphones , the one with the plastic loop that goes around your ear , I 've owned have never lasted for more than 7 months .. hopefully these last longer .  
1	  After the driver installed , bootup my XP takes 5 mins , before one half a min . Also Internet connection is fine but can't see other PC ( LAN ) all the time . This min ok , try again , can't connect ..  
2	  exactly the same size batt as the NPFH30 that sony packs with the DCR-DVD models . that was my priority . haven't used it yet so as long as it lasts any longer than the default , i 'm happy . found it for 32.99 last week , while sony 's website and others sells the same NPFH50 for 60 .  
1	  Purchased for my wife about 2.5 years ago . Not a bad little computer-save for about one year after purchasing the speakers quit working-which Sony fixed quickly as it was still under warranty . Then about 6 months ago the DVD combo-drive began to fail . Most recently , ( two weeks ago ) the hard drive has failed completely . ( with some warning , but I was unable to back up some of the data before complete failure ) Bottom line : Wife loved the computer-it was light , small , and had great battery life . However , ours had its share of problems and there are many people who seem to have similar problems with hard drive .  
2	  This is my second pair of these . I love the wrap around design . Ear buds tend to fall out too often when I work out . The sound quality is pretty good for small headphones and very good considering how much they cost . I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of ear bud headphones .  
2	  I recently tried the Canon S630 printer .. and wound up returning it becuase when printing black text , it smeared to the touch ( very annoying ) . However , I was very impressed with the S630 's abilty to print amazing quality color pictures so when I heard Canon was coming out with a new line of printers - I decided to take another chance . This time , though , I decided to plunk down the extra [ money ] to get the S820 . I 'm pleased to report that the problem with the smearing text is not present with this printer ( it comes out dry to the touch ) and the quality of the color pictures is exceptional ( this was less of surprise since I was also impressed with the S630 ) . Becuase this printer uses 5 color cartridges versus 3 color cartridges in the S630 ( not including the black cartridge ) , the colors come out more vivid . The printier is also sturdier and and an overall better build . Well worth the extra $ .  
2	  Product Presentation was excellent & delivery time was on a timely fashion . PRO-POWER - Portable speakers  
1	  I purchased the bicycle mount for my Garmin eTrex Legend Cx and it doesn't fit ! The back is made for some other model .  
1	  My expectation , based on Elgato 's claims , was that this product would allow me to burn DVDs of comparable visual quality to commercial ones . When I first began using the product I wrote to Elgato to ask why the picture looked poor , and they expressly said it was " DVD quality . " I guess that doesn't mean what I think it means because , even at the highest quality , the final output looks poor when burned with Toast . The picture is laden with compression artifacts . My estimate is that a Wonder DVD looks inferior to an average VHS tape . Why is that the case ? Getting answers to that question or any other from tech support - which is only available online - is dicey . The techs are cordial but the responses are often unclear . One of them told me that I might be happier with another , more expensive , Elgato product if I wanted a better quality picture . Why do I need to spend more money if Wonder offers the elusive " DVD quality " ? Again I could make no sense of the explanation . Perhaps the higher priced product streams more data , but there is no clear explanation on the company 's website . It would be nice to ask directly , but Elgato doesn't even have a voice line for sales . I find it immensely frustrating to deal with a company whose tech support response is next-day , and whose answers are then often not on point . If you want visually mediocre DVDs this product will give them to you . It works and it is easy to operate . You just don't want to set your expectation too high , as I did . Update : Elgato has subsequently told me that the model 200 will not produce a better picture than Wonder on higher end Macs , one of which I have , so this is the best they have to offer . Further update : As of Sep 05 the product has new software problems . The screen goes white intermittently during a recording , and sometimes the recording hiccups . Elgato acknowledges and claims to be working on white screen issue . One more update : I 've purchased a component DVD recorder that is connected to a TV . The quality of recordings made on that device at SP and XP settings are FAR superior to the " DVD quality " produced by EyeTV Wonder .  
1	  I bought a 512mb model u10 right after if came out and after about 8 months began to have problems with it deleting songs on its own , or when I would delete them the songs name would stay in my playlist and would stop playing whenever it came to the song . I have another u10 which is the 1GB model and after about 8 months it is doing the same thing , I wouldn't advise anyone to buy an iRiver product and if you have one take it back now because it will self destruct . IRiver isn't the only company who seems to have problems with their MP3 players lifespan , average life of a much more expensive IPod is only 18 months . Until someone steps in and insists these electronic companies make a reliable product I am sticking with the cheaper products that services like Napster and Urge offer .  
2	  Worked well . DVDs no longer freeze / pause after using this just once . Certainly worth it rather than having to get another player .  
2	  Fuji makes a very reliable blank CD-R that can handle up to 80 minutes of music or 700 megabytes of data . Moreover , these blank CD-Rs are capable of recording data at high speeds-48x ! The data I record onto these CD-Rs has now lasted quite a while-over a year at least-proving the test of time . I have used these as data discs and discs to record audio . I almost never got a coaster . Great ! The CD-R discs are compact and easy to store . While the discs are still blank , store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in . After your burn data or music onto them , I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves . It 's just better protection for your CD-Rs that have anything stored on them . Don't store these discs , burnt or blank , in rooms that become very hot ; this causes damage to any brand of this type of disc and you could lose data over time . There are two caveats that many other people note about any brand of this product : when you are burning the data onto the blank disc , don't be surprised if you see that the data is burning at a rate slower than the packaging advertises ( 48x ) . This can happen if your burner doesn't have the capacity to burn faster , or it may be a quirk . I am not a professional so I cannot be certain of precisely what causes this phenomenon ; but I assure you that the extra minute or two ( tops ) that you wait to get your CD-R completed is worth the wait . In addition , DON'T write on these using Sharpie ink pens . The ink will eventually seep through the top coating of the CD-R disc ; and this will slowly but surely compromise your data . If you need to label the discs , label its ' jewel case using a post-it note . Overall , Fuji blank CD-R discs store data reliably and I believe that an extra minute to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it in the event that it doesn't actually burn at the very highest speed advertised . Use them in good health !  
1	  I tried this drive on Macs at home and at work . It wouldn't read floppy disks on any of them .  
2	  The lock works well . The item arrived on time . I had a good experience with the purchase . I would buy additional items from this merchant again .  
2	  Superior product at a superior price . Delivered quickly . What more could you ask for ?  
2	  Love it ! Very simple and very sturdy . Even has an extra spot for a flash mount accessory ( no power to the extra spot ) . Great for if you 're using a DSLR that records video . You can mount the flash on one and a microphone on the other ( in case you 're switching back and forth from video to photo .  
2	  I 've had this model for about 2 months now and couldn't be happier . Next to my old Apple / Sony monitor this is my new favorite . The colors are bright and crisp , text is easy to read and the controls are simple to understand . As another reviewer pointed out , the brightness and contrast are WAY high . I have both set to the absolute lowest and the picture is still nice and bright and crisp . I like it so much I 'm thinking of buying another one for our latest acqusition .  
1	  I 'm a believer in you get what you pay for . I had pretty low expectation given that this projector screen was one of the cheaper ones available but it seemed to have relatively good reviews so I gave it a shot . Heed the other reviewers that have suggested Da Lite screens or some better alternative . It would have saved me the hassle of writing this review and having to lug an awkwardly long box back to the UPS store . First the packaging . The packaging does not protect the item from standard treatment by shippers . The item is too long and heavy to be packaged with such a light weight box and nothing but a few pieces of styrofoam protecting the ends and middle . Mine arrived with a large hole on the outside and with the requisite dings and scratches on the screen inside . It also arrived with compressed ends but the styrofoam ends were sufficient protection from that damage . The case of the screen was also slightly bent in a way that only cosmetically impacted the item . If this was all I would have kept the screen . It wasn't . The quality of the screen is quite shoddy . Cheap plastic ends , handles , latches , and other pieces that could easily break while moving the screen around . The screen does not stay flat when opened up . There was significant curling of the edges and even a little on the top inside the projection area with a slight ripple wave diagonally through the side when opened . It 's possible the damage to the screen in shipping was a contributing factor in this but I doubt it - it looked pretty superficial . Perhaps the curled edges would have eventually flatted over time but I 'd rather return it and buy a Da Lite screen instead .  
1	  Whoever sold this to me needs to make sure the products they sell in the future , actually work right . My iPod needs to be restored all the time because it loads too slow and then isn't recognized and tells me to restore it . i am getting fed up with it and will be getting a new iPod soon and will be selling this one . The screen works and the audio works , but I have to restart it four times at least to get my computer to read it , and then it 's hit and miss from there . I am not satisfied at all with this , but it will have to do until I can get a new one .  
1	  This arm clamp broke the first day I used it ! Within 2 minutes of setting it up at a shoot the clamp head snapped off in my hand . Save your money .  
2	  Product is very good and it IS what was proposed . Buying , delivery and information were excellent . I really recommend this . -  
2	  This Scosche HA1567B is an easy snap on . But you will probably need to drill the existing brackets of your car to secure the radio . In my case they didn't align with the holes of my new radio ( Sony ) . If you are capable of changing a car radio you can surely do this . Basically , if you want to install a replacement radio instead of the non standard size one that came stock with the car , this product is the way to go .  
2	  I love the idea of this thing , as it will allow be to get some sleep and not continually get up every hour to check the temperature on my smoker . However , the only problem is that the signal seems to be pretty weak , and I had to search all over my house to see where I could get a reliable signal . In the end , I found that I can keep the reciever hanging on one of my window blinds near the rear of the house , and that 's about the only place it picks up the signal reliably . It 's a little inconvenient , but it 's betty than nothing . Overall , I think the idea of the product is a great one , but I 'd like to see the signal be stronger . Even with that , I 'd still by another , as it allows me to get some sleep .  
1	  When I bought the product I had high hopes for what it would do . I am master 's student trying to transcribe my interviews for my thesis . I wanted a product to take my recorder interviews and turn them into written word . This software does not do that . All the software does is allow for you speed up , stop and rewind a recording with your foot . This foot pedal somewhat eases the process but if you did not use a Sony IC recorder the software will not read anything that is not a . wav file . My recorder of course saves the audio files as . wma . So I then had to download conversion software ! The headphones provided with the software and foot pedal are of poor quality especially for the price the product costs . I ended up having to combine the transcription software with Dragon Naturally Speaking to transcribe my interview . It has been a big hassle . I would not recommend this item for if you are expecting a faster and more efficient process .  
2	  We 're a big fan of this case . We use it for our Garmin wide-screen GPS and accessories . We found plenty of GPS cases out there but none of them could also hold our car charger , suction cup mount , etc . This case has plenty of room for the GPS and everything else we need . It has great organizers on the inside and a hard shell to protect the contents . I definitely recommend it for a GPS / accessory case .  
1	  Not impressed . Charged fine but the adapter to my iPAQ was not secure at all . Any slight motion of the cable and the pda lost connection to my computer . So , unless you plan on not bumping your cable or ipaq EVER while syncing , i 'd steer away from this . Also ran into power issues with the iConcepts cradle .  
2	  We switched cable service providers in the Cleveland area from Time-Warner Cable to WOW . Our old cable modem , although supposedly DOCSIS 2.0 compatible , refused to sync up with WOW 's system . When asked , WOW technicians reported good experiences with the Motorola Surfboard SB5101 so I purchased and installed one in our home , replacing WOW 's loaner modem . The Motorola cable modem has worked flawlessly every since , without a single failure in Internet service in the months we 've had the new system . One caveat and one minor quibble . The caveat : the SB5101 had both Ethernet and USB interfaces . We used the Ethernet interface , not the USB interface , which potential users should know needs software installed on the host computer which does NOT work with Macintosh computers . The quibble : the SB5101 has a Standby button ( and light ) which temporarily interrupts the connection to the net . I 've never used it and the more I think about it , the more useless it seems to me . Save a few bucks and get the version without the Standby button . Overall , a good , solid , very reliable cable modem at a very reasonable price .  
1	  Crashed withing 3 months . Customer service incompetent , but I suppose I have to deal with them to get this fixed under warranty . They are sloppy and ill-informed . Never had a SONY handheld before , and certainly won't buy one again .  
1	  I agree with one of the other more recent reviews . Overall , I have been extremely pleased with my Kensington products . They work well with my multiple Macs and also Windows-based PCs . I bought an earlier version of this desktop wireless set ( K64382 ) , which worked well for about two years and then began to malfunction - primarily a few keys that either wouldn't function or only every now and then . I contacted Kensington , and they informed me that they didn't have that set , which I 'd purchased via Amazon ( where I buy nearly all of my electronics and plenty of other products ) . However , under their five-year warranty , they told me that they 'd send me a new set , i.e. , this one ( K64390US ) . It 's fantastic . I couldn't even use the other one where I wanted to use it , which was with my Mac Mini that 's connected to our plasma TV in our bedroom ( reception wasn't very good , which resulted in using it directly in front of my iMac ) . With the new set , it works perfectly with my Mac Mini setup , allowing me to use the wireless keyboard and mouse about ten feet away . I 've experienced no issues whatsoever with the new set , which seems even more responsive as well . I would definitely recommend it as well as the Kesington brand due to my support experience . Sept . 8 , 2011 : This is an update to my original May 3 , 2010 review ( awarded 4 stars at that time ) . This newer set worked well until recently . Then it completely stopped working . It seems like a software issue . However , when I contacted Kensington , they informed me that they haven't updated and don't plan to update this MouseWorks-type software . I 've purchased several Kensington products for Mac over the years , but don't plan to purchase anything else in the future . Logitech seems to have some of the best Mac-oriented keyboards and mice . I 'm disappointed in Kensington 's apparent decision . Their newer iPad keyboard has received good reviews , but I 'd approach with caution based on my experiences with these full-sized desktop sets .  
1	  Rio 's products are horrible , and the Carbon is no exception . Looks nice , but will break within weeks . The controller pad failed on me , making it half useless . Not to mention that the battery is not replaceable and so when it dies in 1-2 years , so will your Carbon .  
1	  - Very short battery life ( a few days ) - No key-lock , so the buttons get pressed if in a bag or on belt ( which means you may miss an emergency alert or you may find the batteries dead ) - No memory when you replace the batteries ( have to re-program and set clock ) - Belt clip / holster not strong enough ( keeps falling out ) - Poor reception ( missed alerts ) I would not recomend relying on this radio for backpacking or receiving emergency alerts .  
1	  This has fewer controls than the controller that came with my DVR . There is no page up or down on it . There is no Yes / No buttons to answer questions like " delete this show ? " The manual was not written well in that the sequence for programming a device was incorrect . I had to mess with it for an hour to figure out the problem . Not what I would expect from Sony . I wanted a controller that would do it all . This ain't it ! There were many positive reviews leading me to think this was a great controller . A pox on your reviews .  
2	  I have no experience with video editing at all . I bought this product to transfer video from my Hi8 camcorder to my computer so I could burn it to DVD . With very little effort I transfered video from multiple tapes and made a dvd movie with titles and effects perfectly on the first try . For fellow computer challenged people like myself this is a great product ! I don't know how the software and features stack up against others , but if you want to make good quality , professional-looking DVDs without having to try to learn a complicated program and system , this product is a great choice !  
1	  Constant fm hiss , reception and output vary in the area of the car . Do not buy this item . I bought it from best buy at 50 $ which also pisses me off . 20 $ more and it isn't worth the 30 $ I wish I had paid for it .  
2	  While I waited for my cable to come , I purchased one at Best Buy for about $ 60 . Once I got this cable delivered , I found that the quality was EXACTLY the same as the expensive one at a fraction of the cost ! Of course , I returned the Best Buy cable right away . EXCELLENT VALUE !  
1	  The build quality of this product seems to be amiss . The first Jukebox arrived with a bad hard drive . It was returned and the hard drive in the second Jukebox went bad 90 days later , with very little play and zero abuse , i.e. it never left the house , was never dropped , etc . Also , don't expect much in the way of volume , it is just not there . Based on 2 bad hard drives in 3 months , there is no way I can recommend to anyone they purchase this product .  
1	  I used it for a year then it broke right after the warranty was over . Now it won't read ANY DVDS ! What a waste of money !  
2	  I bought this cap for my NIKON D40 and it fit like a glove , was a purchase i needed for a very long time . Im glad I found it here on Amazon at a great price .  
2	  Being a college student , I don't have a load of money to throw around trying to find a really nice pair of comfortable headphones with great sound . I did my research on different brands , read quite a few reviews , and ended up taking my chances on this pair . I absolutely love them . I use them almost non-stop and it sounds like the musicians are in the room ! The sound clarity is unparalleled . The volume does not need to be blasting to hear every instrument and soft note . And best of all , these mute outside noises , so I can put them on while others are blasting a TV and I won't hear anything but my music . These headphones are not flimsy like others and hold up very well , but if I do break them , I will buy another pair immediately . For the price and quality , this is an amazing deal . Buy a pair !  
1	  No battery included , and manual doesn't even tell you which battery it needs . Have spent way too much time trying to find a stupid battery . And the headphones are junky . DVD player is cute and works , but there are far better options available .  
2	  These cds came strangely packaged , but they came promptly without damage . You can see the packaging in the picture . I will be ordering from this company again .  
2	  Perfect size and provide ample protection for the screen of my PSP 3000 . Not a touch screen so I 'm not handling it but still I would say I don't notice marks or smudges . I travel with my psp in a case so I can't vouch for the protection value if it 's got items rubbing up against it .  
1	  I bought a 37 inch Westinghouse LCD TV from Walmart only a year and a half ago and already the screen went out ! Obviously the manufacturers warranty is already up after 1 year and although I called them to ask about what it could be that 's wrong they offered me no remorse for the lack of quality and no solution . I then called a tv repair shop and was informed that flat panel TV 's have only about an 18 month life expectancy before they go out ! Well if I would of know that I wouldn't have spent $ 600 on one , I would have stuck with the TV I had that lasted for 20 years . So my recommendation is not to buy TV 's from Westinghouse I am shocked , broke and severely disappointed ..  
2	  I think this bag is actually pretty good . My Manhattan Portage bag finally broke this year ( RIP ) and it lasted me almost 6 .. so I was almost naturally set to get another one . But I decided to shop around cause there were a few things I thought could be more useful to me in a messenger bag . The first was the ease of pockets , and pocket access . This Lowepro bag features 3 internal " slip " pockets " ( no velcro or cover , but nothing slips out ) which is perfect for my day-to-day notebook ( fits a small Moleskine perfectly , along with a pen ) and some small USB cables or snack bars to get me through the day . The laptop slip has a small velcro " latch " that holds my 15.4 " laptop perfectly ( HP Pavilion dv5000 ) , but as others have noted , it is a VERY close fit , almost not fitting without a slight bit of finesse . There is also an outside pocket on the bag flap which is useful for carrying a sandwich or some tissues for even easier access during the day . The bag material is water-resistant , not waterproof in my opinion ( I had the MP " Dana " bag , which was waterproof ) , which is fine , as the water simply beads up on the outside of the bag , but I have seen other materials do this before absorbing a little bit of water at a time and eventually getting soaked . So a little note of caution on that . Lastly , the bag has a small cushion that lies between your laptop and your rear end that all but removes the annoying feeling of having 8 pounds slap against the backs of your thighs as you walk . Big plus there :) I have no real gripes with this bag , I guess , although the material does seem a bit thin ; but while this makes the bag lighter , it also makes it feel like it won't be very substantial . For the price , I would definitely recommend this bag to whomever is looking into it . And for a guy who doesn't review many of the products he buys here on Amazon , I think that is saying something .  
1	  When you buy something from Amazon , they give you this little idea section that says " customers that bought this . Also bought that " Well , I took their advice and got this item , it was the wrong size for my camera . So either the customer that bought that item and their camera screwed up or amazon messed up . BTW , I have had this happened 2 other times so i think it is amazon being very confused ! BTW when you try and return it be prepared for amazon to make you pay s & h ; cause they say " It isn't our fault " . Maybe they should get the recommendation section fixed or start taking responsibility for suggesting something wrong . I never buy anything in the suggested area !  
2	  I love this bag . I use it to carry my Nikon D200 and 2 lenses . Its weatherproof , plenty of space for 4 more lens etc . However , I think I should have gone for 350 version which would have some space for my laptop too . But this is a bargain . If you do want to use it for purely your camera , then way to go . I find it little difficult to carry my tripod in this bag though .  
1	  Is it just me or does this look like a really poorly photoshopped image . Is this the same as the ( fake ) 4gb minisd 's on ebay ?  
2	  I 'm not a DJ , but if I were I think that these would work great . They can be played very loud and are actually louder at the same volume level than other headphones due to a combination of factors I can't explain intelligently enough to even try . I imagine that would be a handy feature if you 're in a loud club or such . It seems that every part of these headphones adjusts , swivels , or otherwise moves so they can be grabbed off a table or from around your neck and slammed up against your ear quickly without having to figure out how to manipulate the earcups . Personally though , I bought these because I wanted a nice set of headphones for music and movies when I didn't want to be fiddling around with my Sony MDR-EX71SL / WK Fontopia Headphones ( in-the-ear headphones .. brilliant for the cash ) . I 'm not exactly an audiophile , but in my opinion on sound quality , these headphones sound EXACTLY like my Fontopia 's , which means they sound great . They do put some pressure on your ears , so extended wearing ( over 2 hours ) isn't exactly a treat . They look really good though , so I give them top marks in style . One added feature I found that I wasn't expecting was that I can plug them into my Ipod at work and set the headphones on my desk as external speakers . They sound great in that environment without requiring another power source . To be a bit more concise on my rating , here is how I would break it down as far as what was important to me when I was looking at these : Sound - 5/5Style - 5/5Volume - 5/5Comfort - 3/5I still give them a five because if I strictly used them as intended ( after all it does say DJ Headphones in the product name ) , I think I would give them a 5/5 in comfort since they are quite comfortable sitting around my neck where they would most often be . If not using these as DJ headphones , I would recommend these for good sound quality , volume and style . If anything else is more important than these three , I may not recommend them .  
1	  Noise , pops , crackles , hiss , sound levels vary based on input levels , in other words the sound is not constant , volume goes up and down ( especially with musical inputs i.e. drums or guitars when practicing ) .. I guess one cannot expect much more for 50 bucks and wireless .. ? stick with wired headphones , I went back .  
1	  This FM Transmitter has to be one of the worst products on the market . It literallyhas no reception . Then I went and bought a Griffin iTrip-crystal clear and noproblems . This Kensington product should be taken off of the market !  
2	  i agree with the others . i was a bit nervous about the battery in the beginning , but it works just as well as the original panasonic one and costs much less . i never had any trouble with it and used this one while the other one was charging . so i always used the original and this one taking turns . each battery would last for a full day even when shooting a lot . i didn't notice any difference and still don't . i don't even check or am aware of which battery is in the camera right now , because it doesn't matter .  
2	  Just received this lock . First impressions are good , the cable is thicker than what you usually see on this type of product . The key is big and easy to locate . The ruber insert keeps your laptop from getting scratched ( not really a concern on * this * laptop ) . I can confirm that the fit is loose but this does not affect how it secures to the device . There is some wiggle room but not enough that it would be able to be shimmied off . Things that I am thinking of now are specific to my laptop . The Kensington slot is right by my system fan , which I have a laptop that blows out 1000 degree air . The metal lock gets very hot . Perhaps being so hot will further deter would be thieves . It 's no secret that cable can be cut , the hope is that no one with tools will come across your laptop and have enough time to snatch it .  
2	  This is a good router and worth the price if you are looking to purchase one . The product is constructed very nicely with many hardware features . The hardware itself includes three detachable 2dbi antennas ( less signal loss ) , vivid connection indicators , and several lan ports . The included hardware features consists with support for wireless standards , security ( wep and mac address filtering ) , and a moderately complex configuration interface . Again , this is worth the purchase .. :)  
1	  When I played back what was recorded it played back much faster than real time . Not only did it not work on my Macbook it damaged the laptop so that there 's a clicking noise on anything I record through different methods .  
2	  This TOSlink to Miniplug is the perfect addition to my home theater . I use it to attach the Optical headphone jack on my Mac mini to my Yamaha 5.1 receiver . The mini connects to a HDTV LCD via DVI-HDMI cable and needs a separate audio connection . Sound quality is excellent with this cable ! And the price cannot be beat ..  
1	  I just got it , and I am sending it back for a bunch of reasons . 1st , it doesn't work with my Dish system . 2nd , the setup is a nightmare . Even after downloading the firmware , and software updates , this was a disaster . The remote would just display firmware successfully updated , and would not leave that screen no matter what buttons you push . 3rd , their database is horribly incomplete , and inaccurate . 4th , it 's a cute idea to try to have one button control but unless it works right it is just another useless selling gimmick . 5th , again , it doesn't control my dish sytem , but the $ 8 Philips remote I have , does that just fine . What a crock . 6th , if a company can't answer their phones within 10 minutes , that is normally a clue that they aren't well managed . Of course you have to install software but it doesn't stop there , you have to disable your firewall and popup blockers , and all that good stuff , and of course you have to answer no in 5 different places to not get their email solicitations , as well as answer questions like where you live , and your comfort levels with different products , most likely more market research . God I 'm so burned out on companies gathering every piece of info on me that they can . Overall an abosolute nightmare , and waste of a perfectly good evening . I originally bought this because of the high compliments other users gave it , but I just don't see how that is . Now I get to pay to ship this junk back .  
1	  We ended up also ordering the 260 cause even though the 270 is more expensive it does not have text to speech . We didn't need the european maps cause we probably wont be going and I heard that they don't pick up signals in most of the european countries . In all I would say , if you only want to use it in America go with the 260 , much better deal .  
1	  I have had this for almost 2 years now and I think it was a waste of money . It functions fantastic as an alarm clock but the sound quality for music is terrible ! I was a little surprised to find it had a dial for the volume control and also a dial for radio tuning . A bit old school for the digital world we live in today . You can't just tune it to 102.7 or whatever station number you are looking for . You have to move the dial a little this way or that to find the station you want . It does have an input to hook up your mp3 but again the sound quality is still horrible . I expected more from Sony .  
2	  I got my ipod almost the very next day after I ordered it . I wasn't expecting it and it was in great condition as were the chargers it came with . Very impressed .  
1	  Just reciently returned my Sony NPFM50 battery that was sold as an oem product but was , in fact , a knock off of the oem battery . My camera would not recognize it as an infolithium battery and after powering up would then give me the message - infolithium only - and then proceed to shut down . I bought this as a spare and my battery that came with the camera worked fine . The seller understood and promptly refunded my money including the cost to return the new battery . My point : beware of fakes they are out there .  
1	  I had a Sony Hi-8 that was great . I love my Canon digital cameras so I thought I 'd get a Canon MiniDV . Well , it works fine and has good features . The video is great , the audio and low light is probably not up to the Sony camcorders . Still , for the money I liked it and was happy . Just out of warranty it goes black and won't record . The shutter or CCD is dead . Reading online this seems to be a common problem with Canon camcorders . So , my new Sony MiniDV is rocking . If you are looking at a Camera , get a Canon , if you are looking at camcorders , get a Sony .  
2	  This item works very well .. it is sometimes easier to set your own frequency as opposed to having the unit automatically set it though ..  
2	  I just got the SE530 Push-to-hear headphones as a Christmas present to myself . I 've looked at these things longingly for some time , but I was always dissuaded by the price . I had Shure E4s , which are pretty good . I figured , how much better can the SE530s be ? Man oh man . These puppies are mind-blowing . Full bass , crisp highs , and clean , clean sound . I 've had them on all day , listening to my Playlists as if hearing them for the first time . They fit good , and even when I blast the volume ( which I don't because full volume is MUCH MUCH louder on these than on the E4s ) no one can hear what I 'm listening to . Here 's how I justified spending the money on these things . I used to save my paper route and lawn mowing money to buy great speakers for my stereo - which cost a lot more than these headphones . But today , I get my music almost exclusively on my iPod . The SE530s are just like getting great speakers . These things are totally worth it . If you have the cash - don't hesitate . They are AWESOME .  
2	  Bought this computer at Sam 's club today . I got tired of my old Dell Inspiron 8100 ( P3 1.0 ghz ) crashing on me and freezing up on me . Never heard from Averatec before but seems like a lot of people buying this brand because of excellent value . This computer is blazingly fast and it is a great deal / price considering all the goods that came with it . DVD burner , a decent graphics card and a P4 3.0 ghz . Obviously , I cannot comment on how it compares to other P4 laptops . It is more of a desktop replacement weighing in at 7.7 lbs . The keyboard is quiet and the fan is quiet . Will comment on durability later . IT IS NOW 5 MONTHS LATER . COMPUTER SHUTS DOWN BY ITSELF FREQUENTLY BECAUSE IT OVERHEATS . I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT : 1 STAR NOW ( OUT OF 5 ) .  
1	  After returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams , the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them . In trying to overcome this through HP 's support line , the recorded message said I would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call ( twice ) . Returned that version also .  
1	  I have used two different Pantone products previously and each worked far better than this one . I am disappointed and no longer use it .  
2	  I bought this for my first gen SNES and the image quality is beyond compare . play contra II and you won't believe your eyes !  
2	  This thing does just what it 's supposed to do . Have used it to connect a Wii to an analog TV . Love it .  
2	  I was happy to see the ithe as soon as I did ; Quality merchandise at a great buy , fast shipping , excellant buy .  
1	  I bought this product expecting to get good performance on both the 802.11a and 802.11g radios simulataneously . Boy was I disappointed . Whenever I use my 802.11a laptop , the 802.11g radio range from my desktop machine suffers . How can Linksys really claim this to be a dual-band router ? It does not perform as expected . I 'll be returning it for a refund . SAVE YOUR MONEY UNTIL A GOOD PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE .  
1	  Attractive and easy to install . I expected at least some base from the speakers . With no low end they sound very tinny . All and all I am dissappointed with the product and would not recommend it .  
2	  Not bad , I returned the 20.00 charger ( 2 batteries only ) to Circuit City and this one works great ..  
2	  I 'm satisfied with the roominess and the quality . It also balances upright quite nicely when the laptop is in it . About the only thing that would make it better for me would be a removable insert for the large bottom compartment that would give me more organization when I don't need the room for clothes .  
2	  these magnetic frames are exactly what we need to display our 4x6 photographs on the refrigerator without the clutter of different magnets to hold them onto the fridge . i am going to buy more ! note that one seller sells a " six pack " so you can purchase twelve frames in one purchase .  
2	  This is a great device to have if you have a laptop , tablet , ect . Only sugestion I have is to make the prongs retractible so it fits better in my tablet bag ?  
2	  I like this product and it works on my camera . I would recommend it to everyone who is looking for a battery charger . I had this thing for over 5 years now and it still works wonderfully .  
1	  The mouse works well . A mere click turns it on , without a complex and confusing setup process . In that respect I cannot complain . You start working with it and get excited that it works so well , without any problems , that you cannot believe . But you quickly notice that it is heavy , and in less than five minutes your hand drops dead . Oh boy ! It feels like you are moving a ton of bricks . I went back to my corded mouse , a cheap Ativa , which , even if it is not as good , I can move with ease . I gave the Philips mouse two stars because it works very well , but you need superpowers to move it after a while .  
1	  I already have an ipod mini but i thought it would be cool to have an ipod shuffle so i bought one and it sucks . It holds barley any songs and it doesn't have a screen . It 's so stupid . I didn't want it anymore so i gave to my friend . and she loves it i don't know why  
2	  My brother recommended these . They sound good and don't take up near the space the original ones did . I 'll buy this brand again when add to my home theatre .  
1	  .. and if you used this alarm clock you most likely slept through it ( recorded history ) . It has a " volume " feature where 0 has no sound and 1-14 all sound pretty much the same in volume . I have never been so let down by anything other than Starwars Episode one .. but it would be a close tie . It is very random on deciding when and if to allow Ipod control via its buttons , its alarm just decided it would work when and if it wanted to .. and it has kept time worse than any other clock I have ever had . I am not sure if I could ever trust Ihome again because this is a horrid horrid horrid clock .  
1	  I ordered this and for some reason it will not work with my Toshiba Satellite Laptop . I had to call the manufacture to no avail . Then I had to call Toshiba they also said it should work . Then I took it to a computer store and they said my PC needs a different card ? Amazon dosen't accept returns if the package is opened ! Amazon also offers no information on returns . Now I 've spent hard earned money for something I have NO use for as well as the firewire I can't use .  
1	  My problem is similar to others I have read here . First , after two years , the power switch became non-functioning . The drive started turning off and on by itself sporadically , and finally just stayed on ( electrical power ) . Secondly , the drive now either won't mount on the desktop , or it mounts and unmounts for no reason , making it impossible to use . Now I need to back up a Terabyte of data , but cannot keep it mounted long enough to copy anything . Do yourself a favor and steer clear of Iomega ; buy another brand .  
1	  I purchased a 2Gb Extreme II SD Card , and it stores the images taken with my DSLR , but it does not display the files in my PC , through the Sandisk usb adapter . Therefore , I have to plug the camera directly to the PC . It is very inconvenient .  
2	  The SD1000 doesn't disappoint . This camera is an overachiever . After picking up this camera for myself I loved it so much I gave one to my mother-in-law as a Christmas gift . It 's an incredible precison device , the pictures are excellent , the video is stellar , it also has a recording feature so the camera can double as an audio recorder . Other ultracompacts with this cameras ' feature set cost quite a bit more . This camera is loaded with features which give you the ability to capture some magnificent shots . I was so impressed with this camera I when out and purchased my first DSLR.I carry this camera everywhere I go . I never miss an opportunity for a great photo . I highly recommend this camera . If you purchase it you 're love it .  
2	  This lens is awesome , best for taking close up picture of wild life and you must use tripod during daylight .  
1	  DON'T BUY KINGSTON PRODUCTS . THEIR ON LINE SELECTION GUIDE WAS WRONG FOR MY COMPUTER . THEY EVEN ADMITTED IT AND STILL WOULD NOT GIVE ME A REFUND !  
2	  If you hate tangles of cords this is for you . The product is kinda flat and not round as I thought so takes a few more wraps to get the cord around . Overall would buy again .  
1	  Bought this tv on black Friday 2010 from Best Buy ! It is now February 2012 and the tv is dead ! 1year 2 months and that 's all $ 1000 worth of Panasonic tv got me . Simply put , the picture quality is really nice while the stupid thing works , but plan on only having it work for less than 2 years . Panasonic customer service will not assist in any way to remedy the situation and they won't even give me the contact info for an authorized repair place . Needless to say that this will be my first and last Panasonic product ever . I will never purchase another Panasonic product no matter what cnet or anyone else says about them and no matter how " highly " they 're rated .  
1	  A perfectly fine mouse EXCEPT that the wheel scrolls itself frequently , apparently because the designer tried to make the force required for each index of the wheel ( each turn of the wheel through one " click " ) as effortless as possible , which was a nice attempt at ergonomic design , but it backfired , because as your hand whizzes back and forth between mouse and keyboard , the wheel frequently turns itself one click , apparently as if your finger left it perched between clicks . This is MADDENING for a number of reasons . You 're trying to read , and the screen scrolls randomly away from your eye . You 're holding down ctrl in Word , about to make a keyboard command , when the mouse suddenly scrolls itself ; and in Word , ctrl plus mouse scroll equals zoom resizing . So your zoom is frequently changing itself . It 's annoying as h * ll and I can't understand why I put up with it for 12-18 months before one day I realized that it 's more than worth $ 15 to go buy another mouse that doesn't pull this garbage a dozen times every day . So I solved the problem in a heartbeat by buying an equivalent mouse of another brand ( Logitech ) . The new one is a blessing because its wheel is sufficiently " stiff " . I never should have subscribed to the false economy of refusing to buy a replacement for the defective Microsoft mouse . It 's more than worth it to remove the daily torture from your workday . If Microsoft fixes the wheel and labels the packaging to communicate that it has been improved , then this mouse would be OK to buy in future . There is nothing wrong with it otherwise .  
1	  Dlink DIR655 extreme N router doesn't work as advertised . Tech supportis uninformed , naive , and unfamiliar with technology . DMZ doesn't work . Firewall is undefeatable . Packets on DMZ placed IP node are filtered . UDMP multicasting discovery protocols will not work properly on the LAN , even with routers multicasting switches enabled . I 'm suspecting that theBelkin product may be a better bet . It 's fast , but tech support on this product is about on the level of Linksys . . . which is to say . . . Godawful . . . K.  
1	  I wouldn't use this product again . There was no paperwork sent indicating what the terms were or even if I actually had the policy in place .  
1	  I BOUGHT AN EXTERNAL CD BURNER FROM AN INTERNET SELLER . IT CAME BRAND NEW IN A SEALED BOX WITH ALL THE WARRANTY CARDS AND EVERYTHING . I AM HAVING TROUBLE INSTALLING IT SO I CALLED PACIFIC DIGITAL SEVERAL TIMES FOR HELP ONLY TO GET VOICEMAIL . MY EMAILS WERE NEVER ANSWERED EITHER . WHEN I FINALLY GOT THROUGH THEY TOLD ME I COULDN'T GET SUPPORT BECAUSE I BOUGHT FROM AN " UNAUTHORIZED SELLER " THAT IS UNCONSCIONABLE ! THIS COMPANY WILL BE OUT OF BUSINESS SOON BECAUSE THEY DO NOT STAND BY WHAT THEY SELL .  
1	  Product works great when it 's not broken . Have gone through two in the last two years . First one had an electronic issue . The second broke in half . Product needs to be improved before I buy another one .  
1	  this is a cool mp3 player , so darn small , but it broke in half when i accidently dropped it ! it scraches so easily too . but wow , breaking in half ! make a tougher ipod next time , apple .  
2	  Once I realized I needed to turn the volume way up and control the volume with the headset only they are the greatest , I love the level control for left and right ear volume greatly helps to compensate for the imbalance in my hearing .  
2	  Ignore the whiners , The ONLY thing this printer disappoints with is it is not network sharable / wireless . For the price , print quality is excellent , copies are good , faxing has great features , prints clear or fast , you choose , scan on the printer and it opens into its own window itself ( nice scanner software package ) , ink is not costly and EASY to replace , dashboard is very well layed out and printer is good at telling you what it wants . Give it a printer Q and network card and every home should have one . Nice job HPIf you want best photo quality prints pay more than 100 $ cheapofor an AIO this printer is the end .  
2	  This DVD / VCR provides excellent picture and sound when playing both VCR tapes and DVD 's . It is very versitile and has ports for many different kinds of cables ( RCA , RF , S-Video ) . It is easy to use and has a very good instruction manual . The only minus is the size . The unit is larger than a standard VCR in length , width , and height . All in all , it is a very good product , especially for a college student .  
1	  I too experienced the dreaded clicking noise in all the speakers . I thought it was a connection issue with the speaker cables so I hooked up another receiver to the speakers and the clicking noise went away . So the problem is definitely with the audio receiver . I took it into a Sony authorized repair center and they could not fix the problem . I 'm just going to return this and get a different system .  
2	  Bought this mounting kit for a 2001 Pontiac Aztek . Kit fits well in dash . Stereo mounted up well with kit . Fast shipping , good price . Would buy again .  
1	  I too have owned several palms and frankly I am quite disappointed . Considering the availability of other Palm OS and Windows CE PDAs , I am surprised Palm even bothered coming out with this one . It lacks so many features that other models on the market have had for a while now . As mentioned above , the quality of the color screen is probably THE biggest disappointment . Also , the lack of compatability with older international kits etc is a big bummer . I too will most likely be shifting to a Windows CE PDA after this one unless Palm gets their act together . Memory is a factor but the expansion slot meant nothing to me ..  
2	  I really like this bag . I was looking for a bag that can carry almost everything that I use along with the camera . This bag fits EOS 400D ( XTi ) , Tamron 17-50 ( hood reversed ) , EF 50mm 1.8 and the battery charger with cable . There are enough pockets for keeping the other accessories e.g. spare battery or additional CF cards . The bag is quite sturdy and it comes with an AW cover which I have not tried yet . Also the camera handling is really simple , with top loading , it is very easy to take the camera out and place it back later .  
2	  I myself bought this case for my Canon SD630 , fits perfectly . I couldn't find any nice looking camera case for my Canon and this sony case was absolutely wonderful !  
2	  I have never used Fuji film in my Canon aps camera before , so I decided to give it a try . Big mistake for thinking that film with the same speed is the same as the rest . I took pictures at an outdoor wedding with Fuji 200 aps film and Kodak 200 aps film and the Fuji prints were terrible . The fuji prints were grainy and the colors looked washed out . The pictures taken with the Kodak film were much sharper and colors were vibrant . Fuji film is a waste of money . Pay little more and go with Kodak . You will not be sorry . Cheap film means cheap looking pictures . I will never use Fuji film again .  
2	  This item , costing a only a few dollars , works great . Don't know why anyone would want to spend a lot more for different brands of the same item . Good build quality . It works !  
1	  The lens was advertised as " Tack Sharp " , which is what you would expect from an f2.8 setup . It was not - poor results - may have been a bad sample who knows . It shipped through Amazon supplier Cameta , and they took it back - VERY easy process - zero hassle . I was concerned that on-line would be riskier than in-person . It was actually a Better transaction - go figure .  
1	  When I bought my Sony camera I automatically bought the same filter kits I had for my Cannon Video camera , so I have both the Neutral Density and Polarizing filters . I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money . First off I don't find that this filter does very much . Its not dark enough to make a huge difference , especially at the beach . There are only two filter types available for this camera and that is not surprising because the main thing you need to know is that this filter requires an adaptor that will cost you an additional $ 30-$40 . The adaptor is a barrel shaped device that screws on over the lens , allowing it to extend fully . What this device doesn't do is follow the lens back in when you toggle the zoom switch . When the lens if fully extended , you get a normal picture . When the lens is retracted , even slightly , you get a round picture with a black square around it . You will then need to use a photo editing program to crop out the picture . As noted above , I also bought the polarizing filter . While it may knock a bit of glare off a metal surface , it is no where near as strong as the filter I bought for my canon for very little more , and costs much less when you factor in the cost of the adaptor . The bottom line here is that if you feel you need one of these filters , what you really need is another camera .  
2	  The player arrived quickly , was easy to set up , and works well . I 'm satisfied .  
2	  This is my first tiffen filter and I am planning to keep buying from this manufacturer . Affordable price and delivers quality colors .  
1	  First off I bought 2 rolls of this " 50 Foot " speaker wire because of the low price . This speaker wire is not 50 feet as advertised . It is only 45 feet . I pulled out my tape measure which goes to 50 feet and I held one end of the wire while my niece held the other end and put against the tape measure and it is only 45 feet . This company cheated me 5 feet per roll . 2 Rolls = 10 feet of wire that they owe me . Do yourself a favor and buy another brand of speaker wire . This company will cheat you . I will never buy anything from this company again and neither should you .  
2	  After months of research into both LCD and plasma tv 's I finally decided that for me , plasma was the way to go . And as I looked at every major brand of plasma tv , the Samsung models kept drawing me back . My search brought me to the HTP4264 42 " plasma screen . Once I decided on that model , I then watched and waited for a price I would feel comfortable with . I purchased my tv through BrandsMart , a local retailer . Back in September it was priced at $ 1200 . By late december the priced had dropped to $ 980 . They must have been wanting to unload everything , because I was able to talk them down to $ 800 . After I got the tv home , setup was quick and easy . I don't have cable or dish , but instead use a roof top antenna . The HD stations come in clear as bell . I was always worried after I got something like this home , I would be disappointed with the picture . You know , " It didn't look like THAT in the store ! " But the picture was beautiful ! Football games are a real joy to watch . Sound is OK since I don't use external speakers . Overall , I have been VERY pleased with my Samsung plasma tv .  
1	  Granted this is an old review from 03 , maybe Sony has improve on thier CD since then , but I have not use them since . - Please do not buy , look for a different brand . You will lose data . I am furious how many Sony 's CDRs I have replaced . They are the absolute worst product out there . I don't know how such a great electronic company would leak such low quality , unreliable CD-R . The problem I have with Sony is overtime the CDs become unreadable . It said not MS-dos error or something when you try to copy the data , basically it become unreadable . The surface of Sony CDR is a smooth pearl . After 1-2 years they start to fake off on the edge like watermark . Not because of careless , but of the CDR surface quality . Other cheaper CDR I have for 3 years ( storage in the same location as the Sony 's CDR ) are still readable and don't fake . I lost some important data with at least 4 Sony 's CDR . The files at the outer edge are affected the most . I though the smooth pearl color of Sony was very pleasing compare to other ugly blank CDR . TDK is now my CDR of choice now . It has a clean look and it CDRs are more readable on any cd-rom then Sony . I am in a progress of reburning all data that are on the Sony to TDK . Again , Warning : Do not buy Sony 's CDR .  
1	  I bought this keyboard mainly because I wanted a backlight feature , but it turns out the backlight is very weak and BARELY shines through the keys themselves . So that 's strike # 1 against this product . Strike # 2 came a few months later when I noticed the paint wearing off the most used keys . What kind of POS keyboard is this ? Best Buy told me to email or call Saitek tech support and they will send replacement keys . The BB saleman seemed to be aware of this complaint . So , my advice .. stay away from this keyboard . You might like it the day you buy it , but a few months down the road you will be mad because the paint wears off . UPDATE : After receiveing a second round of keys from Saitek they all wore off AGAIN ! So I have permanently given up on this keyboard . I can't believe how bad this product is . And they are still selling it .  
1	  I began this novel with high expectations . It was on the best-seller list and I had heard lots of buzz about it being the new Southern gothic . The beginning was intriguing - a little boy is found hung and no one knows who did it or why . Now , when a book begins with an unsolved murder , call me crazy but I expect that that murder will be solved by the book 's end . While the murder is never solved , the story is actually a cat and mouse game between the murdered child 's sister , Harriet , and the alleged killer . Never mind the fact that a child is not a match for a grown man . The rest of the book can be summed up in a few words : drugs , racism , and snakes . The murder is never solved . The reader never finds out what happened or why . After the end of the book , I thought that perhaps someone had torn some pages out of the book because there was no real conclusion ; it just ended . I can count the number of times I 've finished reading a book and felt my time had been wasted on one hand . This , unfortunately , was one of those times .  
1	  I just purchased this product & I 've noticed that its hard to get on my camera body & when I did get it on & turned it on , it came on but wouldn't flash ! I 'm wondering if its compatible with my Nikon D5000 ? Hope that someone can help me !  
1	  Just got the ViewSonic monitor for 1 year , and it breaks ! I called ViewSonic 's customer service and tried to reason with them , absolutely terrible customer service ! The representatives were very rude , they even hang out on me . Apparently , hanging out on customers is the best way to avoid any " problems " for the customer representatives . I had such a bad experiences with ViewSonic , I will never purchase any products from them ever again ! I think everyone deserves to know about what the company 's services are like before their purchase . Please be aware when you buy any of ViewSonic 's products ! ViewSonic CANNOT PRODUCE MONITOR LAST LONGER THAN ONE YEAR !  
1	  The memory card i received did not work . It was totally a waste of money and i had to go buy another card from another store in order to use the camera . VERY DISAPPOINTED with this purchase .  
2	  This microphone is so much better when used with Karaoke Revolution games . You don't have to keep adjusting the headset with each different player , you just pass the mic ! Mine worked great until my dog chewed it , so I 'll be buying two more to go with the Karaoke Revolution 3 game ! This is an excellent price too ! It costs $ 20 on Logitech 's website .  
1	  I was happy with how easy it was to install this router . I got such a great deal ( too good to be true ? ) for $ 33 plus tax at Best Buy . However , once installed , I started having problems with my internet connection ( no connection ) . I tried tech support who emailed me - # 1 . Connect router to the internet . I did not have an active internet connection with the router connected b / c of the router which I had mentioned in my email for assistance . Poor all around for someone who is an intermediate when it comes to computer repair .  
1	  This item was purchased for my daughter as a christmas gift . We did not start using it till March . The only use our system got was in the mornings for 15 minutes while in route to daycare . In June the motor went out . I called Polaroid and they advised that it only has a 90 day warranty and they could replace it for us at near purchase price . This item was a huge disappointment not to mention a loss of money . We will never buy another polaroid product again .  
1	  How incredibly frustrating . This camera arrived with several POUNDS of instruction manuals . These were poorly translated ( from Japanese I guess ) and often referred to stuff that was in the illustration , but not on my camera . I wanted to rip my hair out . After reading and reading and studying and studying , I still could not operate any more than the automatic mode , and never did figure out how to switch between menus . I bought this based on the reviews here that it is a good entry level digital camera .. for WHO ? An engineer ? An experienced photographer ? Let me be the first to say I am not technologically inclined , but HELLO , I thought entry level meant entry level-just entering the realm of digital . I am still so lost . And frustrated . I have signed up for classes to learn to use the thing . A complete exercise in frustration . Never again .  
2	  In researching remotes for my HT setup , I found the Harmony remotes on Amazon were highly rated . I was looking forward to some of the reviews comments , mostly :* Straight Forward Setup via PC / USB * Activities that make switching from TV to DVD easy for everyone in the house * Integration with XBOX 360 / Windows Media CenterThis remote deliveried 100 % of what I was looking for . Setup was easy , install the software on my PC , enter the model numbers for my HT components ( TV , HDPVR , Audio Receiver , XBOX ) . Setup my activities and update the remote via USB . As several others have said , the activity may not turn on a specific device the first time , but all you have to do is press help and the remote will fix itself ! Really amazing !  
2	  Cool retro design . The case does secure the entire camera , but tough to handle if you don't have it on your belt .  
1	  I bought the EX51LP and was pleased with the sound quality and found the earplugs quite comfortable . The plugs did a good job blocking outside sound . But within a month , the sheathing covering the wires disintegrated where there was contact with the skin . I then bought the more expensive EX71SL and again the sheath disintegrated . I expect better from SONY . ( I filed a similar review on the EX51LP . )  
2	  I am a new to this product and so far I haven't found anything disappointing with it ! It 's a great product with alot of features !  
2	  after much research ( a whole hour ! ) could not pass up buying these for rear surrounds . some reviews said they had not much on the high end , and they were right , but for my application they do the job and then some ! my old yamaha 's were worn out and these are a nice kick in the butt to the system , yamaha reciever , klipsch kg5.5 's , and a mirage center really blow up the house ! watched avatar on the blu-ray and the sony 's brought a nice punch in sound .  
1	  When they were new , sound quality was decent , as was range , but then the batteries get used up quickly and the SQ goes down with it . you can use the included adapter , but that defeats the wireless point . remote cant turn them on , and volume adjustment is independent of each speaker ( not in stereo ) today , one of the speakers just died ! good esthetic design thoughupdate 12/14/08Amazon and Cables unlimited have been great about exchanging the defective speakers , even though it was right at the warranty end ( 1yr ) . i noticed the replacements say cables unlimited on them instead of velocity wireless , they look the same , but seem to sound a lot better , than the original . for that , i would upgrade to maybe 3.5 stars , and even 4 if these last longer than the originals ( call me in a year ) :)  
1	  Bought the Zenith Z50PX2D in July of 2006 . Tonight the infamous POP occured . After doing a search for what the problem could be , I 've realized there are TOO many malfunctions with this product . I called the LG support , tech guy basically said too bad . But was kind enough to offer me phone numbers to service centers which are over 100 miles from my home . No way will I pay to have this thing repaired , as so many others have spent more money only to have it POP again within days or months . Not only is it a disgrace for a company to knowinly manufacture such a defective prodcuct , it is a shame on how many tons of trash this TV is adding to our landfills . If anyone knows of a class action lawsuit has been filed , or knows how to start one , please contact me .  
1	  Yes , I can store music on my PDA ( UX-50 ) sometimes . Big deal . The " Pro " is not compatable with Sony software , nor my new Sony television .  
2	  I have been a Philips fan for quite some time , and although this is just a simple cassette to listen to your ipod , it does the job very well . There was one brand that was a few dollars cheaper , but the quality of the Philips name persuaded me to go with them . I 'm glad I did and would certainly recommend this product .  
1	  Purchased this device to connect signaling on an older APC SmartUPS that only supports serial connection . Appeared to install OK and connection with UPS via PowerChute Plus appeared to work OK transmitting control signals and operating log info . However , after running 2-3 hours , driver hangs Windows 2000 SP2 requiring hardware RESET to restart . Experienced failure 3 times . Based on other reports about manufacturer 's non-responsiveness , I am returning the part & driver disk to Amazon .  
1	  This is a great camera , but doesn't even come with any software ! Apple expects you to purchase a $ 30 program in order to use it for what it was designed for ? ! ? This is the ONLY webcam I know of that doesn't include any software . That alone has cost it 4 points in this review . ( ps . Since it 's a firewire cam , other software can use it , including some other videoconferencing apps , but you have to know what you 're doing , which makes this Apple product very user-unfriendly because of the missing software )  
2	  Product : The build is great and the wire profile is similar to the OEM cable . The usb sync with iTunes works flawlessly and there is no noticeable difference in the charge time and sync speed between this cable and OEM . Also the connector is reversible . I am able to sync the iPhone 5 with my car audio and continue to stream podcasts and Pandora . ( Btw , podcasts app is a debacle only eclipsed by issues with Maps ) . Yes , the fit is slightly more snug than the original cable which makes the cable useful in the car . Customer service : My initial order was reported as delivered but never arrived at my apartment complex . I contacted the seller and their customer service was prompt and courteous . They were willing to ship it again once I confirmed the shipping address . The packaging was excellent and , from now on , Boxwave Corp is my preferred vendor . Kudos to Boxwave 's customer service . I am duly impressed .  
2	  bought this cable , got it within 5 days . makes my ps3 look a lot better than standard def lol . great product !  
1	  I 've owned the Toshiba e740 for several months now . I bought it to replace an iPAQ 3670 which needed an external 802.11b PC card to do wireless . ( Very bulky . ) The e704 is a reasonable attempt at a self-contained wireless PDA . With built-in 802.11b wireless ( switchable in hardware and software to conserve battery life ) , it is a decent package . Much more compact than my Compaq iPAQ 3670 with an external 802.11b card . Unfortunately , the reliability is poor . The PDA kept loosing its memory forcing me to reinstall the backup software and restore the applications and PIM information . This was a major pain . Finally , the e740 stopped working all together . Push the power on button and nothing happens . The battery is fully charged , so it must be a failure in the PDA itself . Guess its back to the iPAQ 3670 for me !  
1	  This product does a fairly good job of recording over the air or satellite analog programming , except for some of the strange problems you can run into using a dish receiver I have had little problems on Dish or DirecTV with standard programs . But this device will NOT control an external receiver for anything but Satellite reception and it will never support HDTV reception regardless of weather you wish to record at the lower level of recording . It will never support digital local stations at all . All local stations are handled thru it 's local receiver and it doesn't do Digital . While there is support for Satellite based digital coming , regardless of what they name the DVR it will not be support directly or indirectly by TiVo . Because of that there is no upgrade from TiVo for digital . I own one of these and it 's not worth much now that I have more local digital stations then analog stations and I can only really get a reasonable signal on digital because of my location . In fact I haven't been able to find any supporter of local Digital Recording on any receiver or DVR . I made the mistake of buying a really good receiver and I can watch them but no programming to schedule recordings with so the feature is useless . Oh , and don't expect the Digital TiVo to work with local Digital stations on a local Antenna , it probably won't even list them and it certainly won't record them because it will be maintained by some provider like DirecTV that has no interest in supporting their competition , and they have stated they will not support any channel not transmitted over their satellite .  
2	  I 'm on my second Archos player and this is the one to beat . The wide-screen is huge compared to my old 2.2 inch screen , the controls are simple and intuitive , the KICKSTAND is a Great Improvement ( it allows the unit to sit up at a 15 degree angle so you can watch movies hands free ) , user replacable battery ( you can get extra ones too ) , Excellent photo viewer , NON-proprietary file formats ( not locked down to one format for videos ) , built in speaker and microphone ! The not so great : Lets face it . Earbuds don't fit most peoples ears so great . The supplied ones are good but you should go out and buy a pair that fit into you ears . Sony makes a pretty good , inexpensive set . The supplied case is a dog . It 's a nylon sack that offers no protection . That 's it . Go out and try one . You won't be sorry .  
1	  This product was great at first , the sound was perfect . A few months later I noticed the quality was slowly getting worse . A year later and I 'm on amazon searching for a new one . The sound is so muffled that I can't hear the lyrics from many songs , esp . songs with any synthesizers . I would not recommend this particular adapter to anyone who wants to use it for more than a few months .  
1	  My experience has been identical with other users mentioned here . The unit worked fine for a brief time , then quit playing in color - showing only black & white . I contacted CyberHome and they swapped out the unit for a new one , not super fast , but in a matter of weeks at least . Amazingly .. new unit did the same after a coupleof weeks . Finally it made a popping noise and died all together . Can't see how they can stay in business like this !  
1	  I have purchased and returned two sets of these headphones . The first set overheated and fried itself as soon as the batteries were installed . The second set worked for a little over an hour before developing constant hissing and popping . Also the head band adjuster would not retract on one side , making it impossible to fold them up for storage in the travel bag . I consider the quality of this headset one of the poorest I have ever seen . Even frayed bare wires were visible on one side . I recommend you avoid Taurus products completely .  
2	  So this device has a number of really useful features packed into a great portable device . I can # t really say whether the quality will last the test of time . I 've had it for 2 months now . Initially there were some glitches with sound , these were fixed by a software update , and I haven't had too manhy issues since . Generally the device works well . It exposes multiple features in a usable fashion . The navigation menu 's and overall usability of the device isn't very user friendly . It 's not as intuitive to use as some other players on the market . However all the features are there and more . Try and think of a portable device that can surf 95 % of web pages and truly supports flash content . 99 % of pda 's can't boast that . It has a number of extra " soft " features such as wireless streaming from a computer through the player . If you really want to fully feel the force of the player , you will need to purchase the extra plugins and the dvr station . For around $ 75 the dvr station does a really good job for the price ! It 's not much more than ipod video out cables and it allows this plus much more . Make recordings of any program , stream content from a desktop pc through the player and dvr onto your tv with ease . Surf the web on your TV and watch youtube and google videos through it . This is one of the most amazing things , and the quality isn't too bad , especially with youtube videos ! I 'll need more time to see whether the device continues to perform well to judge whether it will last . It 's not the sort of portable you 'd want to take on a short road / rail / bus trip as it 's not as portable as a simple mp3 player and is more purposeful as a video player . You are likely to use it more as a portable video on long haul journeys , and in this class it performs great . My one major gripe with the product is the lack of tv tuner thus relying on the digital cable boxes to perform the tuning and making channel control difficult ( although the feature is available it doesn't seem to work with my setup ) . This means if I want to record 2 seperate programs on 2 seperate channels I 'd need to manually switch channels . Not the optimum thing to do when recording overnight . A little trick around this would be to use the cable auto program tuning features if you have such available to force the cable box to autotune to the different channels for recording . This should work but is definitely annoying and unwelcome . All in all great device , does what it says and performs reasonable well at it .  
1	  This is the fifth printer I 've purchased , and the worst by far . While the print quality is good , the Canon software needs serious work . Supposedly , and according to Canon , the application should control the paper size and orientation ( a no-brainer in my book ) , but I 've had problems printing even from something like WordPerfect . Instead , you have to set up the printer properties with what type and size and media orientation you 're trying to print . Every time you change media , you get to do that all over again . And , heaven forbid , you don't also adjust the paper thickness guide for the thickness of your media , you 'll have to clear an error message for that .. Then there 's the delightful dialog box which pops up in the middle of your screen telling you you 're printing . DUH . You 'll need to minimize or close it in order to keep working . And if you run out of paper , you 'll get it again , even though the printer will also flash an error message .. After less than 48 hours , I 'm tired of throwing away paper goods , tired of having to do so much work for so little .. If you want to do virtually any editing , even sizing , you 'll need to look to other software . I could have been much happier with something much less expensive , too-I don't see the price justification . I 've made a terrible , terrible mistake ..  
2	  This router can be re-flashed with a custom Linux firmware ( such as openwrt or dd-wrt ) to become a custom Linux device . With the addition in this model of a USB 2.0 port , the possibilities for such a device are greatly expanded . It could easily become a wireless music player , print server , camera server , peripheral sharing device , etc . It also makes a nice firewall / router . This model has increased CPU speed and main memory over the original WRT54G device . The radio in this device , like the other WRT54 routers , is very stong , delivering good coverage for both 802.11b and 802.11g .  
2	  Crucial memory is always a good bet . This was sent quickly and was an easy install . Highly recommended .  
1	  My title says it all . Opened the box , tried it , the CD player did not work at all .. returned it .  
2	  I highly recommend this filter to protect your front lens element , I have owned two of these since 2009 and have not had any problems with scratching . The glass in this filter is top notch , when the glass is clean you cannot even seen the glass unless you hold it at a very steep angle , it just looks like a black ring so it does not impact your pictures . It does seem to collect dust fairly fast but since I have had this on all of my lenses since I purchased them I can't tell if the lens collects dirt as fast . The only problems that I have with it in fact is that the lens still seems to get dust collecting on it even with this filter always and if you tighten this on very hard it can sometimes be very hard to get off but that is so it will not fall off . In may of 2011 my camera ( a 5d with battery grip and flash ) fell off my 3 1/2 foot desk at work onto the floor and landed strait onto the front of the lens . The filter glass broke and the brass ring bent and jammed onto the camera lens , I tried for days to get it off and could not so I took it to a Canon repair station . I waited for 15 min and they got the ring off and check the lens with their camera and said everything looked fine . It may have been a pain when it broke but if this was not on my camera i would have broken the front element on my lens , it may seem overpriced but I will gladly keep one of these on every one of my lenses just to protect them .  
2	  I am a youth worker and wanted a camera to carry around with me for those fun candid snapshots when working with my kids . But I didn't want to carry my heavy camera . This one is PERFECT ! It 's light and runs on double AA 's , so it 's easy as pie to " recharge " when needed . And the pictures it takes are clear and easy to focus !  
1	  Mine broke just about one month after the one-year warranty ran out . I am still trying to find someone to fix it . Grr .  
2	  Its cheap and does the job that its intended to do .. nothing else to say . Great item and keeps your cpu cool :)  
2	  I bought this camera for my 6 year old son 2 years ago and he still plays with it . He is very rough and always break his toys , but not this camera . My son carries his camera every where and after 2 years , it 's amazing . I LOVE THIS CAMERA !  
2	  This speaker system is the best I have heard for the price . The sub-woofer provides a deep rich bass , even at low listening levels . The highs are crisp and sharp . The gaming experience is definitely enhanced with the sound quality these speakers provide . All in all , anyone looking for great sound at a reasonable price will not go wrong with this system .  
1	  I bought this printer because I have always been satisfied with previous HP printers that I have owned . However , this one was a mess from the start . I can live with the fact that it prints slowly and the scans are very poor . However , from week # 2 this printer started getting paper jams errors and out of paper errors when the tray was full of HP all in one paper . The paper feed often pulls gobs of paper at a time unless you only put about six sheets of paper in the tray at a time . I have called HP customer support but they are of absolutely no use . Since the printer was only days old I wanted it replaced . Instead they insisted on " troubleshooting " the problem . I have complained four times and insisted on a new printer . However , they insist on " troubleshooting " the problem . The problem is that I have a defective printer and want it replaced . HP has outsourced their customer support to India so you cannot get anything out of them other than what they are reading on their computer screens . It is like talking to a robot with a bad accent . My advice : Stay away from HP printers altogether .  
1	  I bought the product and it was working great for 1.5 months and still works with the exception of the fact that I can't use my remote from my bedroom now . I have to go into the other room and change the TV . I called the company and I have to send the transmitter , receiver and the IR Mouse back ( AT MY COST ) . They said they could have it up to 2 weeks . They will try to repair it and if not , they will replace . This is all good but I am a bit miffed by the fact that I have to incur the cost of shipping when it is clearly their defect . And , that I have to go without TV in my bedroom ( sad I know ) because of their defect . I wish they were more accomodating but alas they aren't and I am at their mercy . Will update after the unit is fixed . So , I did send it back at my cost and they fixed and it is still working so I am happy with that .  
2	  Our public library requires windows operated MP3 Player . So there was only a few different choices . I have been extremely happy with my purchase for the purpose I bought it for . I put a book on it . The " keys " are flat and covered with the case , so there is no concern of getting gummed up keys . It is easy to bump a key and have it do something not wanted . So once I start listening to the book , I lock the keys , so I don't bump them . I 'm happy with my purchase .  
2	  I bought this lens without getting my hopes too high . But it turned out to be a good macro lens . There are few short comings . 1 . Auto focus mode - camera gets confused . 2 . Good for only closeups . Long shorts gets bit blurry . Manual closeup works great . I finished one full role on this lens and generally the above rule applied to the picture . You can buy it if you are planning to use it only for closeup and you already have a good lens for you portraits , landscapes , etc . Best wishes  
1	  i bought the vaio because all of my other electronics are from sony , and i 've been happy . but they haven't quite gotten laptops down yet . my comp is slower than i 'd expect , freezes at odd times and is generally unimpressive . also , like someone else pointed out , it is a bit hefty to be carrying around . i 'd reconsider buying this computer and i wish someone would have told me the same before i bought it ..  
1	  This camera takes nice pictures but you will only have a few minutes to take them after charging the battery . About 10 minutes or so is all I could get out of a fully charged battery . I called Kodak about this problem , they walked me through the steps to make sure I was charging the battery correctly ( how stupid do they think I am ? ) . Then they told me there must be a problem with the charging dock . Took the dock back to the store and exchanged it for another one . Same problem ! Called Kodak again , this time they tell me it must be a problem with the camera itself so back to the store to exchange the camera for another one . Same problem ! I finally ended up taking it back , getting my money refunded and buying a comera from a different manufacturer .  
1	  Mine lasted all of 2 years and now it has stopped working . Up until now , I have never had a receiver last less than 7 years , so I am a little peeved . I ordinarily have good luck with Sony products , so I am fairly disappointed that this receiver died so soon . And FYI , I keep all of my electronics on surge protectors ..  
2	  Perfect .. love the hard case cover . The size and product is perfect for travelling too . This the 4th one I have bought .  
1	  I 've always had good luck with Linksys , however the Wireless WRV54G is one product to stay away from . This is the second one , the first one I returned because it could not maintain a wireless connectivity for more than 1-2 hours . I 'm using 3 laptops one with a Cisco 350 card , an Orinoco Gold card and a Proxim A / B card .. all these cards work fine with other access points and wireless routers but not with the WRV54G . I am 100 % sure it 's the WRV54G router . The first one was shipped with 2.01 firmware the second one had 2.21 on it .. nevertheless it had no improvements in the wireless connectivity area . The wireless is completely down after a day or so . A reboot is the only resolution . I haven't even tried the other features yet , what the hell , the basic functions aren't even reliable enough to function properly why bother trying the bells and whistles . Bottom line , don't waste your time .. very disappointing !  
2	  I 've used these before . I prefer to hardwire my radar detectors . I can't stand the coiled cord hanging down the dash for the cigarrette lighter . This a cheap solution .  
2	  I wanted a pair of higher end earbuds and after a lot of research settled on the MetroFi . I love them . The sound quality is fine , they do isolate some of the external noise ( particularly useful and welcome in airplanes ) and are really comfortable ( I normally have some trouble fitting earbuds ) . And they cost a lot less than other models . Despite user complaints about their build quality , I 've had no issues so far : the MetroFi have suffered some abuse and a lot of use , but continue to look brand-new . Perhaps because I always store them in the provided hard case instead of just stuffing them in my backpack , where they could get tangled with other cables or yanked ?  
1	  When I first got it , it worked great . But within a couple weeks , the cursor movement was erratic and soon got to the point where it was unusable . So I pounded the [ stuff ] out of it and tossed it .  
1	  I purchased the HueyPro for its reputable " Pantone " name . Well , SURPRISE ! The HueyPro gave me consistent pinkish unusable color profiles . After doing research online and looking at other reviews , I see this is a common problem recognized by Pantone . Very disappointed . So I followed Pantone 's instructions to request a replacement . The autoreply said expect a reply in 24 hours . That was sent over 10 days ago , still no response . NOT RECOMMENDED ! Unreliable product from an unreliable company  
2	  After reading all of the reviews for this product , I had high expectations that did not go unmet . The sound quality is great , the bass is definitely full , but not to the point of drowning out or overpowering the mids and highs . They were only $ 20 when I purchased them and they 're far and above the $ 80 Sony earbuds that they replaced . My first sennheiser product , but definitely not my last . I highly recommend these headphones as an excellent choice with high sound quality and a great price .  
1	  this transmitter looked and felt like cheap , but worse , the adapter did not fit into my Honda cigarette lighter ! I returned it and bought the DLO TransDock which works great .  
1	  It wasn't absolutely special and a need to have at all . All these things work pretty much the same and basically they really all suck . Radio stations , sound quality coming out of your speakers , it just sucks pretty much . Just go for the gusto and spend the money to have your car ( pre 2007 ) wired for a direct IPOD connection from your local radio / alarm / car electronics installation ladies . How yeww doinn ?  
2	  This product is great . It works well and charges electronics quickly . Now I can charge my phone , GPS , and MP3 while Im on the road .  
2	  I am not a heavy user of this web cam . However , when I do use it I am very satisfied . It 's a web cam . I am not trying to make a movie with it . It is my first web cam and couldn't be happier . It is not plug and play . But I do not jump from computer to computer , so that 's alright . Well worth the money . You will not be disappointed .  
2	  Very similar to the Acase . It is much smaller than the average pen which may take some getting used toI don't know how long the ink will last  
2	  I bought an AT PL120 Turntable for a couple of reasons : 1 . ) I wanted a unit that would spin 78 's . It had to have interchangeable headshells and an adjustable arm height because all most all different cartridges ( outside of one brand ) run a different heights . Adn , some cartridges need to run a little " tail down " to get the best sound . Switching from 12 " 33 LPs to 10 " 78 's needs this sort of flexibility and the TA PL120 has that in spades . The other important feature is that 78 's were not always recorded / mastered at 78 . They sometimes need speed adjustments of as much as 10 RPM to get the right sound . The AT PL120 has the option of adjusting the speed up to 20 % . 2 . ) I wanted a rugged TT & cartridge to use to test & evaluate the condition of used vinyl from thrifts store shopping . I 'm trying to rebuild a modest record collection lost to a little flood a few years ago . Since new vinyl is $ 12-$50 it 's not reasonable to try to do it that way , it needs to be done through the used market . That means that records are in an unknow condition when they get home . They can have groove damage , embedded dirt , fluid stains , mold and mildew , etc . The vinyl will usually survive all this ( but the groove damage ) , but it 'll take a good cleaning and a couple of test plays to see if it 's a keeper or not ? The DJ cart on the PL120 is ideal for this as it 's pretty tough ( built for back cuing and scratching ) and can stand the odd un-noticed scratch or more likely a vinyl blemish that was unseen when looking through the racks st the thrift . You would not want to subject a $ 350 cartridge to this ? But the included cart handles it without a second thought - excellent ! And , it 's a pretty good tracker in it 's own right . I have a few hundred hours on this table now and it has handled everything I 've thrown at it without a hitch . It 's a great utility table , a good 78 transcription table and good back-up for your big bucks hi-end TT . I have not used the internal phono amplifier and all my systems have good phono sections . I can't state anything about it . It 's an interesting feature for folks who have receivers without phono inputs ? This table has good suspended feet . It weighs in at around 23 lbs . It has a lot of nice features like a good basic arm , extra headshell storage , a decent fiber / felt mat ( I run it upside down as it 's softer on the old 78 's . All in all , this is a highly recommended unit for a work horse turn table . It even looks good in a kind of industrial sort of style .  
1	  I have been through three of these now and I am completely done . The only reason I got the last one was because the store offered a replacement insurance for an extra five bucks . When the sharpener wore out after 3 months , the store said the manufacturer 's warranty ( 2 year ) took precedence . Their process of replacement is not worth the time , and do I really want another one anyway ? My first grade teaching partner has had the exact same experience with these . We sharpen a lot of pencils every day in first grade , and these don't last .  
1	  Bought a Minolta Dimage S414 digital camera , took about 2 weeks to understand all the features of the camera . Then all I could get on the camera display was Err message . Installed new batterys , memory card and still did not work . Called Minolta and they had me send it back to be repaired . Still waiting for camera . Think twice before buying one .  
1	  The reviews of all other ipod fm transmitters that I 've seen were pretty negative , but this one had mostly positive reviews , even when not counting the one that sounded like a paid advertisement to me . So I decided to give it a try . What a disappointment ! There are several significant design flaws . There is a poor dock connector fit - it 's too loose and falls out at a slightest provocation . It has no frequencies display , so you have to rely on on ipod 's display , which was not intended for that , so you only see a frequency display when it 's plugged in and then it goes away . Besides , when ipod backlighting goes off you can't see anything anyway . The tuning is the primitive kind with tiny up / down buttons . But one could adapt to these limitation if it worked , but it does not ! In a car , now you hear it now you don't . When it does , the quality of the sound varies from bad to worse , defeating the whole purpose of having it . Tried it on a home stereo where there are better filters so it 's easier to find unused frequencies and presumably to lock in and transmit . Worked somewhat better under these conditions , provided I stayed close and in a right position . A step aside and it goes off . Like some kind of infrared device . Overall , forget it . Back it goes . I can't explain the positive reviews that some people left here . The quality of your car radio may make some difference . I can't recommend it , but if you want to give it try , make sure you can return it for a refund .  
2	  There are scrupilous sellers out there that claim to sell this item for less than $ 1,000 and ask you to email them for details . Please dont buy from these people - they claim to be from Romania and ask you to send money to their country . Here are some of the questionable sellers : boschi26 , scapen242 haicuverzisoriiI am buying this item elsewhere ( possibly at best buy ) and I thinkthis is a very good system . They nomally cost around $ 2,000 ) .  
2	  Great and easy to hook up . Not much else to say other than I recommend this product especially for the low price . It will create all the base you need .  
2	  This kit is awesome , comes with everything you need to start making awesome photos with a Holga . The included book is awesome too , and it 's full of fun ideas to try out . I got it for my girlfriend as a gift , great gift idea .  
2	  My 5 Star rating is based on my 2 weeks love affair with Vaio Pocket after three upgrades that are ESSENTIAL for out-of-box product . The upgrades allow the player to BECOME MP3 Player . If you don't upgrade it will be ATRAC3 plus Player , which is Sony version of MP3 . First install the software 's on the CD that comes with the player . Then do the following steps : Upgrade 1 : Firmware on Vaio Pocket to version 3.0 from Sony Site : $U$ 2 : Vaio File Transfer program from Sony Site : $U$ Sonic Stage 3.2 from Japanese Site ( Link is for English version ) : $U$ MP3 Player when connected to you PC is recognized as a removable Hard disk . So , using the Vaio Music Transfer program or Sonic Stage , you can copy your MP3 files as easy as drag and drop . Use Music Transfer Program if you have lot of MP3 in an organized format . The copy speed is much better than I 've seen in iPODs and Rio 's . I didn't find using the G-sense pad to browse and play my music files . I felt it was just as easy , as the wheel on iPOD . Pros : 1 . It has to be the screen . As good as any screens from Sony and it 's bigger than iPOD Photo . 2 . 40GB hard-disk3 . Jacket Picture ( Cover Art ) that you can assign to your albums . Player displays it while playing songs from that album . 4 . Sound quality better than many other MP3 Players including iPOD . 5 . You can transfer pictures from Sony and several other digital cameras to this player without PC . But you need to have the cradle , which comes with the player as it has the USB outlet . 6 . Very cool remote that can be used to navigate some simple features while listening to music . It has a two-line LCD screen . 7 . Can be used as removable hard disk with 40GB capacity . 8 . Replaceable battery unlike iPOD . 9 . 20 + hours of runtime once charged fully compared to 5-8 hours on iPODs . 10 . Very classy color metal and finish . Cons : 1 . It definitely has to be the length of headphones cable . I wish it had couple more feet . Fortunately , it 's not an expensive accessory to buy . 2 . Have to have the cradle to handy if USB connetion is needed or when it 's time to charge . But with 20hrs life on battery , it 's something we can live with . 3 . Less choice of cases unlike iPOD which sometimes is worth buying just for the cool cases out there . I got a case from PDAir site which is made for this player . Excellent quality . So , no complaints now . 4 . Crashes when playing some corrupt MP3 files . The solution is to delete that file using SonicStage software after restarting . For $ 250 , I think it beats iPOD Photo in many areas . I personally , would prefer this over iPOD even if it was same price as we get several accessories already included with the Sony and the battery is replacable and sounds and feels better . If you are a techie , you will even find it user friendly like the iPODs which is it 's main strength .  
1	  I bought this player at Target because it was the cheapest around and I needed to replace a DVD player that was having lots of problems . At first this player worked great , but within a month it started having problems with freezing up , at first I thought it was the DVD .. Now a little over a month later , it skips , freezes , and simply turns itself off while trying to " load " a DVD or in the middle of playing one . This player is going where it belongs , in the garbage !  
2	  the nikon remote shutter control ML-3 works very well with the N65 nikon camera that I use for family activity and especially it makes it very easy for me to be in the pictures when I chose . Excellent qualty at a very attractive price .  
2	  I just purchased a set of these off craigslist for $ 35 . If you find a healthy set just buy it . These are 7 speakers all together in an excellent design . Sound really nice .  
1	  I 've ordered these twice now . The first time was OK ; the second time I got a defective cartridge in the 2-pack . I just discovered it , since I haven't been printing huge amounts at home , and now it 's too late to send it back . Think I 'm going to spend the couple extra bucks to buy these at a chain store locally so I don't have to deal with this again .  
1	  I am not very happy that the Parallel to USB cable did not work . My printer would not print . The PC see 's the Printer but the Printer does not respond .  
2	  We absolutely love this camera . This was an upgrade from our S400 which died on us after about 4 years . The large screen on the back is HUGE and allows you to see enough detail on your picture to know whether or not you got the shot you wanted . Additionally , the controls are intuitive and displayed very clearly on the screen . We 've had a few grainy pictures but nothing that 7.1 mega-pixels couldn't fix . By the time we shrunk the pictures down to print size the graininess disappeared . Overall a great buy .  
2	  I have had a 4 quart Presto cooker for 45 years but it was made out of aluminum . I wanted stainless steel . For so long , all the stainless steel was so thin that everything stuck and they warped . This one has a nice heavy plate on the bottom to make it heat more evenly and it cooks very fast . I am so pleased with it that I am thinking of ordering a 6 qt . cooker . We live at almost 8000 ' elevation . Years past , we had a sheep ranch and lived at much higher elevations in the summer . Most of our sheepherders had a presto cooker to save time in camp cooking .  
1	  We bought this item at Walmart as a Christmas gift for our daughter and while it worked for a while ( about 3 months or so ) , the CD player stopped working . We sent it to the address listed in the manual and it took about 3 months to get another one . And , lo and behold , the replacement unit doesn't work at all ! Pass on this and get something of higher quality .  
2	  I agree with one of the reviewer the color is not as shown in light blue but dark blue . And its probably not for wire under carpet and in room since it is hard to hide . its very thick and strong . But the 12 AWG wire deliver ! Also it is NOT solid copper wire , is braided copper wires . if that is a problem for you . It works perfect for my polk speakers though . I used GLS Audio Black Chrome Series " Generation II " Gold Connector Banana Plugs and all works perfect for the 5-way binding post speaker terminals on the back of the speakers .  
2	  After reading many of the reviews here I was uncertain if this was the best product for dependable use with our needs here in SE Texas . I went ahead with the purchase and received it in time for a trip to San Antonio during the torential downpours in that area during July . We put it to the test with many alerts of flash flooding , tornado alerts and many others in several counties around . It let us know without fail of each one long before the " poor TV reception " alerted us . I was able to setup multiple county alert tracking without any problems , no battery drain problems or any of the other questionable problems reported by others in their reviews . I believe that many of those issues complained about were due to not reading the manual and following its steps in sequence . If you do this you will be happy . Just an additional footnote on the difference between the 100b and the 100c , per Midland support personnel , they are the same product with different packaging .  
1	  Bought these batteries for my Kodak camera . Nowhere in the ad did it say that the batteries did not come charged . Leaving on vacation with two dead batteries , great . Tried to charge them on my Kodak Easy Share Dock and no luck . They would not charge even after 12 hours . Now I have tried to get a response from the company and they will not get back to me . Hope Amazon will be able to help . This is the first time I have dealt with a scam dealer here on Amazon . com . Beware of these batteries and the company ' batteriesinaflash ' that sells them .  
1	  Don't buy this product . I had mine for about one year before I finally figured out that it 's junk . All of a sudden during taping a DVD , it stopped working and I now have a VCR tape and DVD stuck in it . None of the buttons will work , it won't shut off , eject , or rewind , etc . The screen reads " hello " , but the junk ' won't talk to me ' . It 's going in the trash and I 'll never buy another RCA electronic again ! I hardly even used it before it broke .  
2	  I spent hours and hours researching mp3 players when I decided to invest in one . At first , I was dead-seat on getting and iPod , no matter the cost . Yes , I had been sucked into all Apple 's advertising and the sheer " coolness " people who owned one seemed to have . Then I went online . I could not believe the cost of the iPod for so little space and so many problems . I 'm a full-time college student who 's also trying to hold down a part-time job and a life and I simply wasn't going to smack down the 400 bucks ( not to mention the 100 dollars I 'd inevitably have to pay for a new battery ) for such a low rated product . After many more hours of research I decided on the Nomad . I haven't had my player aslong as some of the other reviews but I feel this is the best $ 215 ( I got new headphones as well ) I 've ever spent . The sound quality is fantastic . A few of my friends have iPods , iRivers , etc . and I have to say my player beats them all in this area . You 'll hear things in the music you 've never heard before and this , for me , is one of the best features . If you love your music as much as I love mine you 'll appreciate this feature . Just make sure you get some good quality earbuds . The battery power is good and even though there are only three bars when you use your player you 'll get a feel for about how long it 'll last . Of course , battery life wanes depending on whether you have the EAX Audio on , how long the backlight it set to show and how much you fidget with the buttons . Mine has never died on me . The battery is replaceable for as little as $ 35 at Radio Shack , that was another selling point for me . I love the software . Maybe I 'm stupid but I haven't figured out Music Match and it annoys me . The Creative software is easy to use , fast and syncs all you 're files . I haven't had any problems so far and it 's set as my default player now . The appearance on the Nomad isn't as shiny and aesthetically pleasing as the iPod apparently is but really , if that 's your major concern in deciding on a player you have bigger problems . This player is still sleek and very portable . Yes , it is a little " chunkier " than an iPod but it still fits into my pocket and it is durable . I have dropped my player once from about four feet onto the pavement two days after I got it and I almost had a panic attack . I had read all the horror stories about the player breaking or shattering into a million pieces but all that happened was the face plate and battery popped out and I got a weird look from the Blockbuster girl . It has only frozen once and that was probably my fault , I asked it to do too many things at once . Also , I walk a lot and even though it isn't intended for athletic use it hasn't given me any problems . Ultimately , though , the price was the deciding factor . I got 10 gig more than the $ 400 iPod at half the price . Considering how much money I have already invested in my record collection and in replacing damaged CDs which I was lugging with my everywhere I think I got one heck of a deal . This is a great player but it does have problems . While my buttons haven't broken they are flimsy , as one reviewer put it . The scroller button is plastic and easy to push the wrong way ( i.e. the breakable way ) and there is no stop button . I can't leave the player on ' pause ' for too long because that drains the battery so I end up turning it off all the time and then turning it back on . The backlight isn't as bright as the iPods and it hurts my eyes which are bad enough already . I know it won't last forever and I 'm worried about the crappy Creative customer service I 've been hearing so much about . I 've been taking care of it and not banging it around ( you really really should treat it like the computer it is if you want it to last ) . All right , enough said . Just know that if you 're researching players I highly recommend this product . There is not " perfect " mp3 player but this is a darn good one .  
1	  The cable is not genuine Tripp Lite . It is poorly made and does not have the metal clips like a genuine one should . Some other reviews have reported similar . You can see a pic of a genuine one at at the Tripp Lite site . The cables I received vrom Value Devices were branded " Comax " . Amazon issued me a refund . I reordered and again received a counterfeit one from the seller " Value Devices " . Contacted amazon and was told " Be sure that it will not happen again . " So I reordered again . Guess what ? , the replacement was also counterfeit . Update : 5/31/2012 : This situation was repeated 5 times with each time amazon assuring that the issue would be resolved and I could reorder . Finally today with me being very politely insistent amazon pulled the Value Device item from it 's fulfillment . I am still suspicious that those supplied by the other vendors are not real . $ 2-3 is too cheap for a genuine one . I now have one on order from Tiger and it was genuine . Update : 6/4/2012 : I received another counterfeit one today . This time sold by BuyXtras . You can see pics in the customer images that show what genuine and counterfeit ones look like . If you receive a counterfeit you should contact amazon 's customer service and file a violation of amazon 's rules report .  
2	  These buds stay in place really well during a long jog . The sound quality isn't a good as the Sennheiser Noise Canceling ear buds , but if you 're only planning to use these for high impact workouts , they 're the right tool for the job . My only complaint is that the cord is very prone to tangling .  
2	  These are the standard 2 disc case . I can put in my two cooking show dvd 's in them and slip in a 24page recipe booklet too . There is NOT a ' booklet ' spot , but actually works better than ones with the clip for the booklet .  
1	  I can see in some reviews that folks have had success with this card . However , I experienced all the poor signal / connection troubles that have been reported for this card . Even though Intel keeps updating the drivers for it you should search the internet regarding these issues before buying this card . I wasted far too much time with it . The aopen card I bought when I finally gave up and tossed the Intel worked from the first moment I turned it on .  
1	  This clock worked great for me for about 5 months . One morning in a sleepy haze while trying turn off the alarm I knocked the clock on the floor and now the digital dispay no longer works . It seams that an alarm clock should be able to take a little more than that .  
1	  I ordered one of these scanners and when I received it there was a small particle of white material on the inside of the glass . I contacted Microtek and they advised me that I could not clean the inside of the glass so I should return the scanner . I returned the scanner to Amazon . com and they shipped me another one . When I received it I found that it had two smaller spots of what looked like the same material on the inside of the glass also . These spots do show up on a scan rendering the scanner useless .  
2	  I use it with my Viewsonic G-tab . The stand is sturdy for the most part . Adjustment angles fit just about anyway you want to put your tablet . The only down side to this product is that they rubber " shoes " where the tablet fits suffered wear and tear after 3 months of use . For the price , this is understandable . I 'm happy with this product otherwise , highly recommended !  
1	  Purchased this kit just to have the double din piece for a custom install in my Frontier . I was sorely disappointed as the trim piece did not fit flush within the opening . There was a clear 1/8 & # 34 ; gap which looked terrible . I ended up making a custom piece by hand . Do not recommend if using a double din size unit in a Frontier .  
2	  Besides being able to locate the eigenvalues of any complex linear system and find the true triple integral of e ^ x * xcos ( 2x ) + sin ( yz ) with respect to x , y , and z , respectively , this calculator is great for any student matriculating to an engineering college . I also use it to calculate alimony payments .  
2	  They are by far the best ' phones that I 've ever owned . Contrary to some of the other reviews though , no decent sound card will have trouble driving them . Laptops and onboard AC97 devices need not apply , but these are not forgiving headphones , so you wouldn't want to hook them up to a bad output source anyway . My only complaint with these is that I 've had to replace my Soundblaster Live ! with a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz , as the previously inaudible flaws in the Soundblaster became very annoying .  
2	  For my application , I needed this to go around of of those L-shaped Ikea desks . Good solid construction , nothin fancy , basic packaging . Best of all , It does what it supposed to do .  
2	  I just installed the 4 port linksys and it is the easiest piece of hardware I have ever put in ! If you are going to use DHCP it is already programmed . My PC came up already connected to to ISP and I didnt have to go thru the programming . ( I did anyway just so I would know what was going on ) The 3 other PCs in my house came up just as easy . This is a great inprovement over MS Internet Connection Sharing software and a hub that I was using before . I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to share PCs over a cable connection .  
1	  it couldn't play a few of my Baby Einstein DVDs and I was sad , and so was my little visitors so I had to return this player , sorry I have never had to review with a 1 star , but I thought you should know in case you have baby einstein to watch ..  
1	  Camera broke after having it for only a few months . The lens cover is stuck half open and half closed . When I turn it on or off it just vibrates and returns to that half & half position . I haven't even used it a dozen times . Called Sony to have it fixed and they said that it would cost over $ 100 just to look at it .. I will never buy another Sony again . Very disappointed .  
1	  I wish I had read the reviews first ! I too received theitem with an empty cleaning fluid bottle ! Bummer . ButAmazon is giving me a complete refund and paying my postage !  
1	  My Model CD started to have problems after one year of light use . Initially the display would lose segments and then would require a power-down to restore . This problem got worse with time . After less than 2 years of use , the dosplay has now failed completely and the player rejects all disks from any manufacturer . It was never a great sounding player , but having invested in several other Tivoli Audio components , I had no alternative but to live with their extremely expensive single disk unit . Obviously my unit is out of warranty and I am out of luck , but I would sure hope that this company ( which is always boasting of it 's audiophile roots ) would help it 's loyal customers out of this situation .  
2	  I bought this product to rescue the data on my hard drives after a PC of mine was struck by a power surge and refused to boot . I put my hard drives one by one into the enclosure and copied the entire contents of each drive onto the new PC HD . Will practice better data backup in the future . The install of the drive on the enclosure was not hard but was complicated by the tight fit of the ribbon connector . I thought I was going to break the black base connector on the CoolMax . I had to use what I thought was way too much pressure on the ribbon in order to get the screw holes to line up . This is hard to explain - try it - you will see what I mean . Anyway , nothing broke and the data on both drives were rescued . USB performance was acceptable . Unit did seem to get hot and this would worry me if I were going to leave the unit on for months at a time .  
1	  It goes down once a day , I would say . In the search for the problem , and in the down time , and in the complaints to my ISP thinking they were the problem , this has likely cost me $ 1000 's of dollars , as I am a web entrepreneur . That is not to mention that this is a replacement for my WRT54G , which seemed defective in the same manner , so I threw it out . What I have now read is to watch out for cordless phone interference . Maybe that will solve the problem . The user interface and advisor is ok , but not great . It misses several items that I wish were there . So , I wish I had gotten a phone and router that didn't interfere with each other . Whether this is a problem with routers or just linksys I don't know . But , in any case , it appears linksys failed to sell me a product that works for myself and a large number of people .  
2	  This product has got to be the best one out there . When i first looked at it , i wasn't too sure i wanted to get it , simply because of the price . But after reading all the reviews , i decided it was worth the money , and i bought it . I am so glad i decided to buy it . The iRiver 350 has everything i look for in a cd player . It plays almost every audio format out there , and the sound quality is amazing ! With it 's adjustable bass feature , i feel that i am finally getting the bass i want out of a cd player . This tiny cd player rivals my 5 speaker system for bass and sound quality ! The anti-skip protection on this cd player is incredible ! It doesn't even skip on old fashioned-bought from the store cd 's ! I tried shaking it up and down , twirling it around .. and it still does not skip ! The iRiver has two antiskip modes , and i was on the lowest one , the 40 something second one ! As an added bonus , this player also has a remote . The remote was a little confusing at first , but after about 10 minutes you can use it like a pro . The LCD text display was on that , not the cd cover . At first i wasn't sure that it was going to be okay to operate with only having the text display on the remote , but it was a good choice for iRiver to make . Not having the text display on the cd cover makes the player a lot more durable . The accessories that came with this player are not as good as they could be . The cd case is more of just a protective cover , so if you don't want your cd player to get broken i would suggest that you buy an actual cd carrying case . The headphones are the earbud kind . They are not too bad for being earbud , but if you want the full sound quality of this player i would suggest you buy a set of better ones . This player also comes with rechargeable batteries ! At first i was disappointed , because i figured i needed my own charger , but the cd player charges them for you ! This is the best cd player out there ! I admit the money was a little more than i would have liked to pay for it , but it was totally worth it !  
1	  This radio has fine reception on AM and FM ; however , at this price the SSB should work too . It does not . Knowing that SSB reception can be enviroment dependent I tried several different times on several different days in city and country . I also used the attached antenna and a 23 foot external antenna . Trying to get help from Sangean is difficult and costly . They require money up front with no promise of a fix . If you want SSB reception forget this radio .  
2	  In spite of some less than positive reviews on this product , we bought it . We are REALLY satisfied with it ! The picture is clear , the VCR works perfectly as does the DVD player . We haven't yet taken advantage of the other options it offers , but are sure that they too will perform as they should . Great TV at a great price >  
1	  I 've had this UPS for around a year . The battery has degraded to the point where it only runs for about 10 seconds before giving up , with a 150 watt load ( measured with a watt meter ) . Getting a replacement battery from APC costs $ 20 plus $ 10 for shipping , so it 's either $ 30 for a new battery , or $ 39.00 for a whole new unit - seems like a waste .  
1	  Though I haven't had the leaking issues that some folks have , I would have to whole-heartedly agree that this machine is outrageously loud when on the high setting . Fortunately , the medium is fine for my smallish bedroom . BUT the problem I have is with the light ! Nowhere on the box did I see mention of the horrible , massive , green glowing light . As someone who needs it pitch black to sleep at night , this thing is like putting a giant beacon in the middle of the room . And despite my best efforts at covering the light without covering the vents , it 's impossible to drown it out completely . OH . AND the gurgling . Almost forgot - it periodically gurgles - loudly - while it 's on . Tends to wake one up on and off all night long . If I didn't need a humidifier so badly for my asthma this week during allergy season , I 'd have taken this unit back where I bought it immediately . Unfortunately , I 've been hard-pressed to find one .  
2	  What can I say ? They are cables and they work . Pretty well made , not flimsy like other brands . If you need something a grade about what you find in the department store , they 're better than throwing all your money into monster cables .  
1	  I took a chance and bought this even though I saw the bad reviews . I thought to myself " it 's only a dollar , if it dies in a month or two like the reviews say , I will just get something else because this does have some good reviews .. " This completely ruined my Ipod Classic 80 gig . My Ipod was 1 month old , I had to return it and get a refurbished one because of this ! It shipped to me real quick so I was happy , then i took it out of the packaging and right away charged my Ipod to a full battery relatively quickly , still happy . Then I went to listen to my Ipod .. Every single song was complete static ! I restored it to factory settings and reloaded with the same problem . I took it back to apple who restored it again and put their music on it and they got the same results ! I have never written a review before , but I felt the need to warn anybody who is on the fence about buying this .  
2	  I have 2 of these now and will be getting about 3 more the ease of handling and the secured holding of the disc as well as capacity makes this an ideal case for our massive collection  
1	  I got this for a Hewlett-Packard camera chip . Oops-wrong reader ! Anybody need this thing ? I can't use it .  
1	  The 45 sec . skip protection is a joke . It skips just sitting the unit down . No battery display , only tells you when it is low , really , really low . When you stop it wont restart at the exact place you left off . The unit will only restart at the begining of the track you left off at . Not good it its a really long track .  
2	  This remote lives up to all the hype . It does everything you would expect . I even got it to control my XBOX Media Center . the only flaw with it is the ergonomics , they aren't the best , and it 's very smooth / slippery . I wish it had more gription .  
2	  I 'm on my second Sennheiser headset and I didn't even bother looking at other headsets when I bought a replacement headset since the sound quality and comfort from this headset is outstanding . I bought the headset to use originally while playing WoW with some friends and every time the voice quality in sending and receiving was outstanding . . . which I could not say was the same with my buddy who sometimes had to fiddle with things a bit to avoid sounding muffled . I also have used this headset quite a bit to watch movies on-line , listen to music or playing PC games when I don't want to disturb my wife in the adjoining room . Again . . . sound quality is excellent . For the price I 've been quite pleased . Now as to why I am on my second set . . . my darn cat who has a rubber wire fetish chewed right through the first set 's wiring . . . which is why this second set will not be left out where she can chew on it .  
2	  I just stocked up on this Memory card . The price on this is great ! I use it on a Fuji Finepix S800 . We travel a lot so I really do not get the chance to down load until I get back home and can con my sister into doing all the dirty work on the computer ( she feels needed and I 'm to lazy to do it ) for me . And yes , I am lazy since my computer already has digital media built into it . Anyway , I have never seen a XD ( extreme digital ) card this cheap ! The cheapest one I found was Wal-Mart at close to $ 60.00 not including tax , that was last year . I can average well over 300 excellent quality pictures with one card . Depending on your Quality settings I 'm sure you could get 150-600 if not more pictures out of this .  
2	  I 've been taking digital photos for the past 6 years and waiting to replace my coolpix 1MP ( It cost a small fortune 6 years ago ) . I just couldn't wait any longer and did my research only to realize the digital camera I really wanted ( basically an SLR ) is still way out of my price range . I decided to look for a compact camera I would use even if I had that great camera . One for keeping with me at all times . It needed to be small compact and sturdy . I have a tendancy to drop things . Online I did my research and I took a friends Kodak on vacation . While the Kodak was easy to use it has an odd way of compressing memory and the display is not the best so I ruled those out . In the end the S230 fit the bill . Then I get on here only to read about red eye problems .. back to do more research . I found a site with reviews and photos taken for comparison . Sony 's DSC-P9 ( 4MP ) was the best option I came up with but I couldn't get past the soft look to the photos . The Fuji camera 's had alot of noise that was visible on screen . ( It doesn't show up when you print the photos . ) The Sony had it 's share share of noise also . The Canon 's photos were sharp and clear with little visible noise . I believe even better than some higher MP models . So I decided I could put up with fixing the red eye . Best choice I could have made . This camera is wonderful . It is small , well made and has easy to use buttons . The features are set up in a logical manner that make them simple to remember . The screen is excellent . The camera does have some weight to it even though it is so small . I find this to be useful when I 'm trying to hold the camera steady to take low light photos . The camera is quick to turn on and is ready to shoot within seconds . There are not long delays while it waits to change modes either . There is still the issue with red eye if you are not at the same level and angle with the subject . ( And it 's alarming ) But the software included is super easy to use and takes care of the problem better than the Adobe softwares I 've used in the past . The pictures download fast and are stored in folders by the date taken . Perfect for sequencing pictures of the kids . The battery life is excellent but when the warning light comes on you 've only got about 60 seconds to take that last picture . The battery takes 2 hours to charge from empty . The charger fits directly into the outlet and stores flat . ( No cords ! ) The extras you 'll need ( Including a reader so you won't waste battery life on downloads ) will add a third or a forth to the cost of this camera . The movies are fun and easy to send to family . There are also some manual picture taking features that are useful to get good pictures in low light without the flash . I 've had the camera for 2 weeks and I really can't say enough about the quality .  
2	  Strengths : Easy to keep charged . Lets me compensate without turning the TV up loud . Convenient , as placing the device back in the charger keeps me from misplacing it . Replacement silicone earpieces are great . Easily lasts a listening day on single charge . Weaknesses : Earpieces it is supplied with made my ears sweat and were expensive to replace . When I eat or read or use laptop while listening , it is difficult to stay out of the way of the infrared beams that make the device work . The weight of the power and audio cords in the back of the little transmitter box tend to drag it back across the top of the TV set , making me have to reposition the box frequently . There is no balance control or mono switch for those who have lost hearing in one ear or who have large imbalance of hearing loss . Comments : The last weakness I 've shown is actually the most important one . I lost hearing almost completely and suddenly from perfect hearing a few years ago . This device allows me to overcome the resulting tinnitus in that ear by supplying louder TV sound to the other ear , which still hears fine . My brain modulates the tinnitus when I hear sounds coming in the " bad " ear , so not having ability to make stereo into mono and channel all into the other ear is a weakness for me . For those with bilateral hearing loss , there is no difficulty with the device . I overcame this by wiring up an adapter sending both channels into my other ear and nothing into the " bad " one . The silicone earpieces are easily obtained and last for an indefinite period . I 've already had mine almost a year . Do NOT remove the fiber ones until you are ready to replace them , as they are a one-use item . You cannot replace them on the earpieces once you pull them off . I liked the my first " 2.3 MHz " unit so much that I obtained an additional one for my computer area , freeing me to move about while I listen to audio from the computer . I can listen late at night and not awaken my wife with the second unit . I noticed that the original ( 95 kHz ) unit is still being sold by Amazon . But it mentions in the text : " This system is not recommended for plasma or LCD screen televisions . " AHA ! Get the 2.3 MHz system if you have a modern TV or you will hear a VERY annoying BUZZ from the flat-screen TV or computer monitor . Unfortunately , THAT older system has a balance control , which the company dropped from the newer model for some reason .  
1	  I bought them and recieved a pair of cans that were dead on arrival . 3 weeks later and after numerous arguements with seller did i only see a refund . I bought the " Dre Beats " instead they are alot better . Buy this item at your own risk .  
2	  I got a 1st generation ipod nano 2GB for Christmas ! I love this thing ! it is so easy to work and fun . on itunes i can easily download the songs onto my ipod . i did it in 5 min . without any trouble . the games are fun and easy to play . it has a calendar too . i don't recommend any other brand but apple .  
1	  I wont recommended . Major design issue , memory gets messed up after one year and the factory still don't have a fix for it . its not worth it  
1	  Excelent headphones , but microphone doesn't work . have tried it on 4 + computers , both macs and pcs , the computer can never detect it , even when the detachable microphone is plugged directly into the audio-in port . I bought it specifically for the detachable mic , and therefore am quite disappointed .  
2	  Works fine , 8GB capacity , and the price is right , I 'm working with the first set of photos right now .  
2	  I 've used many other thermal grease before but this one is one of the best . grease goes on easily and seem to be thicker than other paste .  
2	  I got this for my two year old to use with a portable DVD player for our first airplane ride . We tried out the headphones with our ipod as soon as we got them and he was in love . He has only watched TV a handful of times , so I think he will be really excited if we take out the portable DVD player for him on the plane . He was so happy wearing his headphones , he sat on our couch that first night listening to music for over a half hour . He is not one to sit still for long so we were very impressed . They fit his head perfectly and when I tested them out myself the sound quality was great . I really appreciate the volume control option as well to protect his little ear drums .  
1	  I bought the charger and it worked perfectly for three weeks . Then it stopped working . I returned the item hassle free , postage paid , full refund because I had it less than 30 days . Maybe I just got a bad charger . I will order another one from amazon and hopefully it will last longer .  
2	  I needed some more CF as some of my previous stuff just wasn't fast enough to write from the buffer of my Canon DSLR . Shots were being lost as I would fill up the buffer , and then have to wait for it to be written to CF . Not all CF 's are the same , even if they say the same speed ( ex . 80X ) . Additionally the same card can have different results in different camera 's , if you need the speed , its worth the research . This card isn't the fastest on the list but its in the Top10 ( which at that point the differences are very small ) and had a great price point compared to some others .  
1	  I ordered this even though I read some of the bad reviews , and now feel like an idiot , because though I can hear everyone fine , they all tell me I sound far away and fuzzy . Money DOWN THE DRAIN .  
2	  This is very high quality wire and a surprising value . The sections are color-coded so you have no problem maintaining proper speaker polarity .  
2	  I really enjoy the quality and performance of this radio . The only thing I have to add to the other reviews is to SHOP AROUND ! You can find this radio at other sites for a lower price than the one vendor listed on Amazon .  
2	  Yes , the paper will spill over the paper tray , so you have to be there to catch them as they emerge if you are doing a lot of copies . But it 's a good buy for the money : faster than my last HP printer , and the print quality is great .  
1	  Bose has earned its market share by advertising towards naive non-audio savy consumers . Universally reviled by the audio industry and audiophile , Bose products are designed and engineered for the " lowest common denominator " . What this means is that the companies ' parameters for design are focused on the Circuit City / Best Buy purchaser who knows little about audio standards and has seldom listened to higher end , but equally priced competitors . Don't waste your time on this garbage called Bose and ignore the sad " self proclaimed " audiophools who who think they 're great . Audio engineers , speaker builders , designers and techs who work on audio equipement all know Bose is poorly made ; so should consumers .  
2	  Very good product . Set your control unit , such as a TV , and then allow your speaker system , VCR , DVD , and other peripherals on the auto-switch plugs and when your TV is off , your other energy burning electronics are cut off too .  
2	  This lens is amazing for the price .. super sharp , and of course is very fast .. it gives amazing bokeh .. just wish it was like 24 or 35mm instead of 50mm . For those with D40s , please note that it won't autofocus on your camera . It works great with my D90 .  
2	  This was a gift for our teenage son , who has been bitten by the photography bug . It has not been off his camera since !  
2	  This is excellent wire ; unlike some others , it is actually the gauge on the label . Good , heavy copper stranded wire protected by a clear and strong plastic sheathing . And it is priced fairly and honestly . I think it is the least expensive 14 gauge speaker wire here , but it is as good as the most expensive ( which are mind-bogglingly overpriced and hyped like the snake oil medicines of the 19th century ) . Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain , Dorothy , our gazillion dollar speaker wire will even clear up your acne and make you better in bed .. Sheesh . If only we had cared about education , maybe those con men would be unable to get rich selling their ridiculous speaker wire . Buy this wire . Enjoy the music and the money you saved by doing so .  
1	  The software is hard to use . The sound quality is aweful . Try playing any CD in order it will not . Stay away from this product , it 's cheap for good reason .  
2	  I received my CD in a timely fashion and spent three hours playing it as soon as possible ! Thanks for the prompt service .  
1	  The camera itself looks nice though is a little bigger than you would expect . The problem is that the image is simply - as noted many times below - too dark to be usable . Now apparently this is a known logitech problem , but also apparently , logitech does not care enough to fix this problem on their flagship webcam . I purchased this camera because my wife is far far away for a few months , and I would really have liked to be able to see her once in a while . She 's somewhere where there are no webcams to purchase . It 's such a crappy picture , that we are not even bothering to webcam anymore . So I 'm giving logitech two-three weeks , and if it 's not fixed I will ( a ) file a Better Business Bureau complaint ;( b ) never buy anything from Logitech again ; and ( c ) post this review everywhere possible on the internet . Go elsewhere .  
2	  These monitors are a steal at $ 255 . The picture is super sharp ; I was so happy with them that I bought 25 more for my office . Highly recommended !  
1	  The box says that it is XP compatible , but apparently they didn't try to install it before making that claim . Take it back to Wal-Mart .  
1	  I have no issue with Amazon - great service and prices . I have an issue with Ricoh . This product DOES NOT last the life cycle that Ricoh claims ( not even close ) , which is why I gave it one star .  
1	  I purchased this mouse about 6 months ago when they were on sale at the local electronics store . Everything went fine , installed without a hitch and even came with a USBtoPS2 adapater which works fine . I really like the extra button on each side of the mouse . This is very handy for navigating forwards and backwards through web pages , or you can set it to copy and paste or any other key combination through the software provided by Microsoft . However , earlier tonight those 2 buttons I count on for so much stopped working . I rebooted , reinstalled the mouse drivers , did the usual routine . Still no dice . Why not 1 star ? I called up Microsoft and they 're going to send me a replacement if I fax over a copy of the bottom of the mouse . So at least they 're taking care of a customer . So I love this mouse , but it has failed me in my hour of need ;) Hopefully I just got a mouse from a bad batch , since I wasn't able to find many people online with this same problem .  
2	  Went through the old " plasma vs LCD " game for a couple of months . Could of fit a 46in LCD in my entertainment center . Looked hard at the LCD 's and just decided for me , sports and movies , the plasma gave a better image . A little more film like and not as edgy as the LCD 's . LCD 's look great upon first viewing , but watch some sports and people 's faces . For my usage , plasma works better right now . Bought this TV when the price dropped . Love the gloss black frame . Picture , after 100hr break in and adjustment , is stunning on HD and acceptable on SD . SD will always look a little soft , nature of the source . Have read many accounts on the web of this set " buzzing " . Set my TV up in the dining room for a few days just in case I got a " bee hive " in a box . Set was super quiet . VERY SMALL buzzing from the top left I could only hear if my ear was 6in away . At 2ft + it was quiet . Yea ! Then went through reconfiguring my entertainment center , new HD cable box , new AV recv'r , new DVD upconvert player , new speakers , just a few wires to re-route . Got everything connected , cleaned off fingerprints , sat back and turned it on . BUUZZ . Dang ! ( or words to that effect ) Sound was not tolerable until the volume was turned up past 15 . Now it 's 1am . Looking on line for what I might return the set and get , dreading the back and forth of service calls on a new set , kicking myself for not heading the " buzz " warnings I had seen online . After about 30 minutes of self flogging , I realized " hey the set was quiet in the dining room . what changed ? " Started doing the old cable check , surge protector check , even tried another outlet on the same wall . Nada . Then I got a thought , grabbed one of my Transparent Audio Power Cables . It 's one of those semi-hi-end filtered AC cords . Plugged it in to the Samsung , turned the TV back on , and whisper quiet was returned . Picture even looked clearer , might just be me though . Guess the end result is , I 'm extremely pleased with the picture quality , set looks great even when off , new antiglare screen dramitcally reduces room glare . It 's in a 16x24 room and looks awesome . However you MUST have a clean AC plug or some type of quality power filter / conditioner , not your regular surge protector , to get the most from this set . For some reason this set , or maybe plasmas in general , are more sensative to line issues . Good luck on your choice . I 'm happy with this one . Now if I could only fit that 63in plasma .. :-)  
1	  Lousy reception . Snowy and fuzzy . ( and yes , the old set it replaced was fine ) And since it 's wide screen you get to see everything stretched . Wide screens look good but if you want to watch them without the stretching .. well , this 26 " is like an 18 " when set to normal . I 'm not seeing the value to wide screen at all unless all you use them for is watching dvd 's .  
2	  Should have purchased this mouse several months ago when I bought my laptop . The mouse feels great and is easy to use . Microsoft did a great job with the ergonomic design . I 'm still using the same battery that came with the mouse , and I 've left the mouse on several times overnight . It 's great not to finger tap my laptop anymore !  
1	  I would have given this card 4 stars had it not ruined my newly built computer for 4 months . I built a 1350 dollar computer by myself with all the most fancy and nice hardware . On paper my computer should have run super fast like lightning ! However i found myself waiting over 3 minutes to open word files , as cpu uptime got longer it would dramatically slow down performance , and it got to the point where i needed to restart every 3-4 hours . Finally after 4 months of usage i got sick and tired and tested every piece of hardware , software , and driver . Eventually i figured out that it was the X-Fi software that was bundled with the soundcard . A process that was called DLLML was eating up all of my resources and causing all of my frustration . I had to dig into some forums and found out a way to stop this process from running at startup . Now 4 months later i finally have a completely stable and lightning fast system as it should be . Imagine spending 1350 dollars and the computer runs slower than your older cpu . Please beware of this issue , i have no problems with the card it self but the software is just unacceptable . Creative really dropped the ball on this one .  
2	  it works great used it on my old cameras , shined them right up :) i would reccomend this product to others !  
2	  By far these headphones are the best pair for under $ 100 . I went through a pair of Sony 's and the Sennheiser P-200 before getting these and they sound as good as everyone says . My only beef with these is the cheesy hook system for collapsing them . It works , yes , but the hook and it 's mate on the other side hit the tops of my ears and annoy me ! I 'm really tempted to take some metal snips and cut them off , but than I 'd had sharp metal potentially and that could be worse . Even with that little problem , I give 5 + for these and will probably buy a second pair .  
2	  This isn't so much a review of the camera itself , as it is information on a way to resolve what I consider to be the camera 's biggest downside ( other cameras too ! ) . This might get a little wordy though . In reading some of these reviews , I notice that a lot of people have trouble understanding Networking technology ( BIG surprise ) , causing them to suffer through tech support calls . But , knowing even a few basics , can help avoid having to make that dreaded call .. As most people now know , WEP ( Wired Equivalent Privacy ) is badly broken , and is only good for keeping honest people out of your WEP enabled network . The DCS-900W only supports WEP . My home wireless network is configured for WPA ( Wi-Fi Protected Access ) , which offers much stronger security , ( but only as strong as you make your pass phrase ) . I didn't want to open up my entire LAN to black-hat hackers , by adding a WEP access point , just so I could add the camera . So , here 's what I did to keep my network safe , and still use the WEP based camera .. I happened to have another router , and another Access Point ( has to be two separate units ) . I used my laptop to configure them through an Ethernet cable . First , I set the router 's ( that is , the additional router 's ) LAN address to an available address within my existing LAN : 192.168.254.253 , ( Use the same SUBNET MASK as everything else : 255.255.255.0 ) . Then , I set the WAN IP to a static address of : 192.168.1.1 . Then , I configured the Access Point to have a static LAN IP address of 192.168.1.2 . Of course you also have to configure the wireless stuff ( i.e. SSID , WEP , 64 , or 128 bit encryption .. ) . Now that the new router and Access Point have been configured , here 's how to connect them up .. Using Ethernet cable , connect from your existing router , hub , or switch , to a LAN port on the new router . Then , connect the Access Point to the new router 's WAN port ( It might be labeled " Internet " ) . Now you need to create a " static route " in your original router 's configuration , that will allow users who 's PCs reside on your network ( in my case , on the 192.168.254.0 segment ) to access the camera ( s ) which reside on the 192.168.1.0 network segment . The static route parameters ( fields ) should be something like this : Active or Enable , Name ( of the route ( it 's just a name ) ) , Destination IP ( in my case , the added network segment address : 192.168.1.0 ) ( It might need to be entered as : 192.168.1.0/24 ( the / 24 indicates 24 bits of the segment address or another way of saying there 's 24 bits in the subnet mask ) ) , Gateway ( in my case , the LAN IP address of the new router : 192.168.254.253 ) . If the router 's IP is 192.168.1.1 , and your Access Point 's IP is : 192.168.1.2 , then your camera ( s ) can have any IP in the range of : 192.168.1.3-254 .. At this point , you can access anything on the " 1 " subnet from the " 254 " subnet . Now , I haven't tested the following with my setup , so you might need to play with IP addresses here , to make it work ? If you want the camera ( s ) to be able to access DNS ( Domain Name System ) , and NTP ( Network Time Protocol ) servers , you 'll need to open some ports on the new router . This is called " Port Forwarding " or " Virtual Server " or " Firewall Rules " ( Depending on what your router manufacturer wants to call it ) . Anyway , you 'll want to configure " Inbound Rules " . For DNS , the Port is : 53 for both TCP ( Transmission Control Protocol ) & UDP ( User Datagram Protocol ) . For NTP , the Port is : 123 for UDP . You want to " Allow Always " . For the destination IP , depending on how versatile your router is , you might try giving it the LAN IP address of your original router , or maybe the actual destination IP of the server providing the service . Once the ports have been opened , the cameras and the Access Point should all be able to use DNS and NTP services . I 've said all of that to say this .. Having another router added to your existing infrastructure , provides a safe way to incorporate any equipment that is limited to WEP . Assuming your added router has NAT ( Network Address Translation ) turned on , Nothing malicious is coming through it , into your original LAN . And if your Access Point can disable wireless to wireless communications , then even if someone does obtain a wireless connection to the Access Point , the only thing they can even attempt to do is guess the Admin password to the Access Point . So , make it STRONG . But that 's ALL they can do . Hope this helps a little .  
1	  I love the companion 5 speakers after hearing those speakers the companion 2 will sound like a total disappointment . on the other had these speakers are perfect for those who love extra bass . I think for such small speakers they produce way too much bass .  
2	  Ipods / music / photos / audiobooks / etc , done deal , no question , so let 's talk video . It 's easy to load onto pod once you 've procured appropriate video-to-ipod suite software , although it does take some time . Given the limitations of small screen ( 2.5 " ) , the end product is pretty good , although I 've found dark / black scenes can distort . The real problem for me is battery duration . You 'll only get approx 2 hrs viewing time out of unit , and this is drastically decreased if you overuse fastforward / rewind function . To combat this , I use a Griffin * TuneJuice * , a power pack containing a 9v battery which attaches via the dock . Of course , for overseas trips , I also carry extra 9v batteries just in case . Having experienced this type of portable video capabilty for the first time , I 'm starting to think the ipod doesn't offer enough , and I 'm thinking of more dedicated machines such as the Archos 500 or Cowon A2 - bigger screens , longer battery life etc - or perhaps I 'll wait until Apple bring out their full-screen , turned-on-side , virtual clickwheel model ! In the meantime , I 'll make do with the ipod .  
1	  You are better off building your own computer out of parts from the 80 's because that 's basically what you will be getting . Where to start with what is wrong with Dell , customer support ( they will argue with you ) , hardware failure ( if it works right the first time count yourself lucky ) , the motherboard - you get what you pay for remember that , and if you do not upgrade then there will be NO slot available for upgrading later , and the funny thing is that it will work for about four months then the problems start . And as for their printers , RUN don't walk away , RUN far ans fast .  
1	  While these cables do the job , they dont do it very well . I am dissappointed in the quality they provide while watching BlueRay movies or HD tv in general . And playing PS3 with them is a joke . There are spots all over the screen . But Like the title says , you get what you pay for .  
2	  Finally decided to buy this lens for my Canon 20D and after 1000 shots of all types I know I made the right choice for a lens I don't have to change all the time . There 's no subsitute for a few prime lenses of known good quality when you know what you are after and don't mind taking them all with you , but for this price , the Tamron is a little gem IMO . f2.8 would be nice .. but at what price ? I reserve 5 stars for something near perfect and that is mighty hard to achieve for anything IMO 8- ) 4 stars makes me very happy though .. Just wanted to add this .. This was the quickest rebate return I ever applied for ! The way it SHOULD be for all of them 8- ) BTW , now over 2000 shots taken with this lens and I 'm still happy . Update : Now at over 6000 shots taken and it 's still a gem to own ! No problems to report .  
1	  I agree with all the good stuff listed against this product ( model - 360 ) . I have been using this for about 6 months now ( brought it for a $ 100 more ) . But there are some major issues , because of which I would advise against buying this model . First , many places are identified by their Township names , and not city name . For example an address in the city of Collegeville , PA is identified as Upper Providence Twp , PA . Similarly for French Town , NJ it needs the township name . Township is a logical demarcation for administration ( Google that if you need more information ) , but usually addresses are specified by city name . This makes the GPS ineffective in many rural areas , not because it doesn't have that map , but because it identifies it by a different less known name . Another irritant was its identification of county roads by CR numbers , instead of road names . The biggest showstopper was its inability to find the shortest route to a destination ( it has other options but not this ) . Many times the GPS routed me through longer routes . My advice would be to go for Roadmate 760 model . When you are going to spend this amount of money , it is better to go the extra distance and get a reliable GPS , and not a toy like what I have .  
1	  I bought this equipment less than a year ago for one of the bedrooms of our new Bed and Breakfast . The machine has been used no more than 10 times and was never able to read most of the DVD of our collection . I called customer support and was able to speak with a real American ( Congratulations to Go Video for this ) . He told me to clean the lenzes with a special disk that could be bought at Radio Shack which I did . But the reader kept skipping tracks randomely even after the cleaning . I called Customer Support again and the told me that they would exchange the machine for $ 59.99 plus shipping charges . What a highway robbery . I 'll just take it to our dump , write off the cost of the machine and will buy a Panasonic .  
2	  I purchased these earphones mainly to watch movies on my laptop while on aeroplanes . I was previously using some ' can'-type headphones which while very effective at isolating background noise where very bulky and not terribly comfortable for using for hours at a time ( I fly between Australia-US quite frequently ) . These little guys are amazing ! They are equally as effective at isolating background noise ( i.e. * very * effective ) , are much more comfortable to wear for extended periods , and are much easier to travel with due to their minuscule size . To give you some idea of the sound isolating ability , I was wearing them at work listening to music from my laptop . I had the volume set to the lowest possible before it was off completely , and it was easily loud enough - almost too loud . It was also frustrating for my colleagues because they would attempt to engage me in conversation and I wouldn't even hear them - and that is at the lowest volume setting ! That 's got to be better for your hearing than cranking up the volume to drown out background noise . The absolute sound quality was not so important for me as the other factors however these earphones definitely had far superior sound than the ' cans ' I was using . As far as inserting them into my ears is concerned , I was expecting this to present some difficulty . However , after two or three attempts it became a non-issue . I used the foam sleeves which worked best for me . Incidentally the foam sleeves can be easily cleaned ( with a little dishwashing detergent ) if they become a bit grubby . A super product .  
1	  I have used many brands of DVD + R / DVD-R . Memorex seems to have a high rate of unsuccessful burns . I would recommend another brand . TDK seems to be my favorite . Never any problems and more affordable .  
2	  I ordered this photo keychain for my wife . She loves carrying photos of all of our family and showing off our granddaughters too . " She " was able to load the program within mintues and loaded 26 photos within a few minutes . She took it to church with her that night and started showing off the family ! It is worth the points . Everyone should have one - good gift also .  
1	  The strands in this wire are very soft . No matter how carefully I clip the plastic sleeve ( using my wire clipper or a blade ) , there are some strands that get broken . While connecting the end to speaker screws , a few more drops off . This is not a good sign . Quality of the wire is poor . Fortunately Amazon return policy is good , I returned this item .  
2	  I bought this rear view camera to be used on my Pioneer Car AVHP4000DVD Double Din AV Multimedia Receiver that I have on my Lancer 2008 . The camera images look GREAT , it also has infrared sensors for an AMAZING night vision , you don't even need your reverse lights to be turned on to see in complete darkeness , I can ASSURE you that . It is waterproof , and this feature I did test it already , since it rains a lot in my country and haven't had a single problem with the camera . UPDATE : 2 years later , this low budget camera is still working great . The only thing I 've noticed is that when the camera gets too much sun light , the image may get a little red / pink and I guess is because of the IR sensors . Once it cools down , the image is displayed correctly . Anyway , couldn't ask a $ 20-$40 camera to be ultra high quality so I 'm still glad with the purchase . If anyone else had problems with " water " , you surely got a deffective product , I take my car to the carwash every week ( they wash it with high pressure water ) and it rains a lot in here , not a single problem with water so far .  
2	  While the price of this camera has declined about $ 100 dollars since I purchased 6 weeks ago I still feel like I got a great deal . I bought the camera for an Alaskan cruise and it performed beautifully . The Zoom is fantastic and the sound on this camera is superb . I do reccommend buying an additional battery as you cannot charge and take pictures at the same time so you need to be able to switch the battery . One review I read reccommended the larger camera case to carry all of the accessories you will have such as the charger cord , battery charger , extra battery and discs . However It would have been nice to also have a smaller case which only houses the camera itself when you have no need for all of the accessories . I plan to purchase one . All in all a great purchase . Now I need to learn all the details of using and editing !  
1	  Waste of money . Worked OK for about 4 months and then it died ( average use was less than 1 hour / day ) . Electrical burn smell in the room and the picture became messed up . That 's it . Dead , just after the 90-day warranty period . Disappointing , since the unit feels solid , nice buttons , mechanism , Made in Taiwan ( not China ) . Still did not last . PAL-NTSC conversion is only so-so . Not the proper aspect ratio , so widescreen PAL movies are squeezed and thus people become very skinny . A better option are the Philips or JVC players that provide a proper letter-box picture and preserve the original picture .  
2	  Nice for the wireless home w / more than one computer . I have three wireless computer on a N network . Once I did get the install disk to work the rest was easy and everything prints from the network .  
2	  This briefcase is a lot bigger than I expected . I 'm sure it 's my fault , as I have a hard time with interpreting measurements .. At any rate , it is very nicely made . Plenty of room for a laptop and a lot more . This bag could hold legal papers , or business papers , or even college books and notebooks . There are also pockets to stash your miscellaneous items . Although , if you stuff it full with your laptop and papers , it is going to be heavy !  
2	  Prior to buying this camera , we had a simple " point and shoot " Sony with a 3x optical zoom . That old camera had issues with low light shots ( i.e. , 50 % of our indoor pictures were blurry even with the flash on ) and it took a long time between pictures ( i.e. , take shot , count to ten , take next shot ) . Again that is the old camera . For a new camera we wanted a stronger zoom ( 12x ) with image stabilization , better low-light handling , and a faster interval between shots . ( We use it for our three kids soccer games , indoor and outdoor / night and day games . ) The decision was between this camera ( Canon Powershot ) and a Sony ( H2 ) , both being 6 MP , 12x zoom w / stabilization . Luckily we actually tried the Sony in person and found that the slow shot problem was still there even in the new Sony . No brainer , we bought the Canon . We love the camera . Turns out the " flip and turn display " , as well as the stereo movie mode ( both features absent in the Sony H2 ) are now also our favorite features .  
1	  I bought this camera because of the 10x optical zoom , which you just don't find on consumer-quality digital cameras . Alas , now I know why . It 's almost impossible to hold the camera still enuf to get a clear picture at maximum zoom unless it 's in bright sunlight ( quick exposure ) or you 're using a tripod-quick 10x zoom shots in less than perfect light are almost always a little blurred . No image stabilization like in the nicer video cameras . If I had it to do over again , I would have bought the highest megapixels I could ( now there are some that are 4 + megapixels ) and a 3x optical zoom . That way , I 'd have the sharpest pix , and a reasonable chance of getting a sharp zoomed in shot , even tho it wouldn't be as close as the 10x .  
1	  I agree with the two previous reviewers . There needs to be a user manual and there isn't one . The fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees . This isn't very helpful for star gazing . The maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches . This is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing . Celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together .  
1	  This is what happaned when I tried to use this drive on an otherwise stable Windows 2000 system : The Iomega Tools installer demanded an immediate restart as soon as it completed . The system hung on restart and had to be power-cycled . A new item called ' active disk ' appeared in the system tray on successful restart . There was nothing indicating it had anything to do with Iomega at all . The Iomega entry on the Programs menu had nothing in it but a couple of web links ( ' help ' and ' update ' ) . I was able to read a pre-recorded Zip disk with no problems , however , when I tried to eject the disk ( using the right-click menu item ) , Windows flung a bunch of panicked popups , yelling at me for disconnecting hardware without going through the " safely disconnect hardware " interface - it basically acted as though I 'd unceremoniously yanked out the USB cable while the drive was still spinning . Then it vomited up one of those always-delightful " Unrecognized exception " error popups , and promptly hung . When I used this drive with an OSX system , every time I tried to eject a disk , the drive spun for over a minute before spitting out the disk . This is all mysterious . I never had these kinds of problems with the SCSI Zip drives . In any case , at $ 10 a pop , the Zip media format has been effectively eclipsed by writable CDs and DVDs .  
1	  These combo packs are not for Brother MFC440cn . The end is not compatible when inserted in the machine .  
2	  gr8 cable , fast transfer of data . not much to say about a cable :)  
2	  Hace un par de a & ntilde ; os estuve buscando un portable para escuchar en el bus y en horas de espera . Cuando vi el SRF 59 fue amor a primera vista : peque & ntilde ; o , compacto y de buen dise & ntilde ; o . Y si por afuera parece genial , vaya sorpresa me llev & eacute ; al escucharlo . FM casi n & iacute ; tido , con una recepci & oacute ; n inmejorable . Sonido est & eacute ; reo que s & oacute ; lo en radios muy caros he podido escuchar , y m & aacute ; s sorprendido a & uacute ; n cuando prob & eacute ; con aud & iacute ; fonos grandes , da la sensaci & oacute ; n de escuchar directamente de un disco compacto . Pero si qued & eacute ; impactado con el FM , vaya genialidad del AM ! Una selectividad incre & iacute ; ble , sonido depurado y de alta calidad , a pesar de ser an & aacute ; logo . Vivo en Costa Rica y con mucha facilidad logro recibir emisoras de Nicaragua , Honduras , Panam & aacute ; y Colombia .. algunas como si estuvieran a la vuelta de la esquina . Si tuviera que comprarme nuevamente un radio de AM portable , no dudar & iacute ; a en comprarlo otra vez .  
1	  Got theses for an old camcorder , The batteries work fine for about five months then they started to leak .. ughh waste of $ # 1  
1	  Having used a HP L2335 for two years , I decided to buy this cheap 19 " LCD monitor for my secondary desktop thinking that the quality of entry level LCDs should now be on par with expensive LCDs from two years ago . Unfortunately , that is not the case . This monitor has several problems : 1 ) Major backlight bleeding especially around the edge of the screen . 2 ) Terrible black level . The black level is simply too white . This makes the backlight bleeding near the edge even more visible . 3 ) Terrible " vertical " view angle . No mater how high I stand or how low I seat , I could not get a even brightness out of the screen . 4 ) Requires lots of adjustments ( both OSD and Windows Desktop ) and I could not get a satisfactory color level .  
1	  This product is poorly designed ! It 's little more than a hard drive with batteries . Something as simple as organizing mp3 tracks by artist is not available . Or album . That makes organization a nightmare . Archos should not have released this product without better functionality . ( Archos 's FAQs recommends to organize with folders . Give me a break . What if you want to play by artist one day and album the next and then style the next . That just it 's possible . ) Archos should update and release improved firmware quickly .  
2	  I got one of these cards so I can game at gigabit LAN parties and I 've started upgrading my home network to gigabit . All three of my PCs at home have one of these cards in them and I found the install to be so much easier than I thought . Windows basically installed this automatically for me . Just shut down , power off , physically install card into PCI slot , boot PC back up and let windows search for driver and you point to the CD that came with the adapter and BAM ! you are up and running with gigabit aon the next reboot . I can now transfer files soo much faster between my PCs . I share and save video files , games , CDs , MP3s , etc between all my PCs and this card and gigabit switch have greatly decreased the time it takes to transfer large files from one PC to the next . This is vital at a LAN party when everyone is trading files . The faster I can go the better . Thanks D-Link !  
1	  Did not pick up more than five channels in my home . Probably due to how far I live from the broadcasting stations .  
1	  When my daughter began downloading music to the ipod it immediately froze and was not functioning at all . The ipod was returned and another ipod ( same brand ) was mailed to me immediately . A couple of months later it froze again . I didn't bother to return the product and disposed it .  
2	  I recently decided to get rid of my ipod shuffle , and try a nano , and I can't believe what I was missing ! Since budget was a big consideration , I started out with a used 2nd generation 2GB nano - while I loved it , it just didn't have the room I wanted , so I sold it and bought a used 4gb - WHAT A DIFFERENCE ! For some reason , it more than doubled what I could fit on it - I 'm still trying to find music that I want to put on it . I don't need to carry my entire music collection around with me , just my favorites , and the 4gb nano is perfect for me . It 's so easy to use , and so easy to carry around - we spend a lot of hours together ! This Ipod has exactly the right amount of space for me , and it seems to make everything I do more pleasant , even housecleaning ! In fact I find myself looking for things that need doing around the house , and a whole lot more is getting done , just because I enjoy listening so much . The sound quality is great , too ! This is the perfect Ipod for me - maybe one day I 'll upgrade , but I don't see any reason to , so in the event anything happens to the one I have , I hope used ones will be available for a LONG time !  
2	  It 's just computer memory so there isn't a lot to say except it arrived in a timely manner , it was the right memory , and it works fine . I have purchased PNY quite a few times in the past and it is every bit as good as Kingston . I always buy whatever memory is available at the best price , and normally that is PNY  
2	  A80 is a great digital camera . From other reviews , you might have read its great features . I would like to address some issues that were mentioned in other reviews : 1 . Weight and Size : Depending on which digital camera you used before : if you used a heavy one before , this one is as light as a feather . But , if you used a " credit card sized " one , this A80 will be big and heavy . A80 is not very light , but not heavy at all . It fits nicely in a lady 's palm . It will not fit into a shirt pocket . What 'd you expect for a 4 Megapix camera ? 2 . Speed : Not as fast as a SLR , but among the fastest group in digital cameras . It can be easily controled .. another plus . 3 . Media : Compact Flash is the mainstream . Olympus uses XD . There is hardly any card readers for XD media . Although Olympus also produces great cameras , I don't want to touch XD since I 'll also be using CF for my PDA and MP3 players . 4 . Power saving function : A70 has a bad function : the power saving function cannot be controled by the user . If you turn on the camera and not use it for a while , it will turn off automatically . A80 corrected this by putting in another function for you to turn the power saving on ( not off ! ) . You will never have to worry about it .  
1	  I got this camera January 2006 and I 'm so disappointed with it ! Images are never sharp . I called the manufacturer and they told me trying new sets in the camera . I 've tried so many things and can't get a good image . However , I give it 2 stars because i 've been using the camera as a camcorder , and works pretty as a camcorder ! The other reason why i gave it 2 stars is because two months ago , I dropped and somebody stepped on it and it still works ahahaha it 's amazing ! If you want sharp pictures , do not purchase this camera . I have an older ( 2004 ) SONY DSC-P73 , 4 megapixels and the pictures quality are a LOT BETTER .  
2	  Alright I am gonna keep this short and sweet , the speakers are awesome ! Great sound , nice highs , mids and more than enough tight bass . I worked for thirteen years at multiple high end audio retailers and these are a very nice set of speakers for the money . I found an open box deal in perfect condition for $ 100.00 , although now that I have heard them I would not hesitate to spend 150.00 to 200.00 on them . They sound that good .  
1	  I read the reviews before I bought this . Numerous people complained about a hissing noise that you hear all the time . So why did I go ahead with buying it ? Because I am _ NOT _ an audiophile ! I know people who will only listen to 256 kbps MP3s because they can " totally hear the difference between 192 and 256 . " Well , I can't ! So when I read those reviews I thought that maybe the reviewers were just overly picky . Let me tell you - they are NOT . The humming hissing noise is really loud . It sounds like those old clock radios " wake to buzz " - if those alarm clocks have a volume of 10 , this is certainly a 1 . I really really thought that I could deal with it . I said , " Well , most of the time I will listen to it fairly loud . " But then a song came on that had a lot of quiet parts , and you could hear that horrible hiss ! I 'm going to have to send it back - it 's that bad .  
1	  This is probably one of the WORST products I 've bought in a LONG time ! It should be something found in a dollar store - no joke ! PROS : - No batteries needed - Smaller than a bread boxCONS : - No volume ( earbuds laying on the table could produce as much sound ) - Much larger than it seems in pics - Dangerous to the delicate jack on your MP3 playerAfter reading many of the reviews on here where people complained about the low volume , I thought they probably just had high expectations . I went into it with very low expectations . I expected that this thing would not get any louder than the speaker on a cheap cell phone . However , this thing is SO LOW that my earbuds can produce as much sound from as far away . I can put this up against my ear at full volume and it 's still barely loud . I typically keep my volume restricted at about 75 % on my iPod . I had to unrestrict it and crank it up to 100 % to hear sound in a quiet room . Once you pass about the 80 % mark on an iPod , these speakers crackle ( but still don't give you enough sound ) . I am convinced that the company used the cheapest speakers they could find . I know that the speaker in my cell phone is about 10 times louder , eventhough it 's about 1/4 of the size of each of these two speakers . The size of this piece of junk is actually much larger than it appears in photos . It 's about 4.24 " w x 1.5 " d x . 75 " h . It could have very easily been about half of its size ( the housing is just a big empty cavity ) . The jack is mounted rigidly ( no swivel , etc . ) . So , it 's always sticking out and when plugged into your MP3 player , it will act as a huge lever , applying force that can easily break the solder points on your MP3 player 's audio jack . I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT ! All I wanted was to listen to podcasts through this thing with my iPod on the table right next to my keyboard - this isn't going to cut it , at all !  
1	  I received this flower hood and adapter for Christmas after I specifically requested it . I thought it would be a good way to protect the lense from my fingers and other peoples . It does protect the lense ( if you buy a clear filter to go on the front of it ) but a Pringles can taped on the end would be just as effective . It blocks the flash and leaves a dark spot on your pictures and the flower hood has to be perfectly aligned or it will partly obscure the image . It also blocks the night vision and hologram feature , but to take it off to use either of these or the flash is a pain . Pro .. protects lense ( if you buy a seperate clear lense filter , but will cause focusing issues ) and somewhat protects from the sun . Cons .. Obscures the flash , infrared , and hologram . Pain to take off and put back on . Flower hood partially obscures image if not exactly aligned . Save your money .  
2	  This lens is just what you need for portraiture . That 's it .. For the price , you can't beat the quality of 1.8 f-stops .  
2	  I 've been using Targus bags for years . My last one was the 17 " CityGear bag which i 've had since 2007 for my 17 " macbook pro . As I recently purchased a 15 " MBP , the 17 " was just too big ! I landed on the CityLite 15 " and I have to say that i 'm pleased with it . I has enough space for the laptop , charger , mouse , iPad ( in an otterbox defender case , which is impressive ! ) , and other ' ditties ' that I carry around with me . The quality of the bag is pretty good , but i am concerned about how long the shoulder loops will last . I have a lot of stuff in the bag and the last thing I need is for them to break .  
2	  Timely delivery . Breifcase is well constructed , has lots of useful compartments . Superior in comparison to other similar breifcases . Decent price .  
2	  I bought this CD-RW a month ago and I was quite fasinated at the ablilty of this writer . One thing for sure is that the burn-proof system is done so well that I am able to burn music CDs at * 12 , but there is no problem in the sound whatsoever . It 's a pretty good buy for such a writer at such a good price .  
2	  this is a great cable for use on a small set . It is flexible and gives a great quality picture !  
1	  Perhaps this category of transmitter works in a rural or suburban environment . In a city , NYC to be specific , it is unusable . There are no locations on the FM dial which do not have static .  
1	  Blurry on the edges , heavy once connected to a 50mm , realy a cheap fish eye alternative that will deliver just that , mediocre results  
1	  These cheap thin light plastic noise emitters are the best headphones I 've ever purchased that specialize in only emitting the brightest and most earpiercing excessive of 2k - 8k frequencies . Two tin cans and wire would sound better . If you are tone deaf and are losing your ability to hear mid range then these are for you . Somebody once told me of SONY ; " There 's good Sony and then there 's cheap Sony . Never mix and compare . " Well , lesson learned .  
2	  This TV is exactly what we were looking for to put in our bedroom . Screen is perfect size , TV and DVD work great and the ability to set it to come on every morning works as our alarm clock , just like we were used to with our old set . Great buy .  
1	  some disks with mmc code are actually made at cmc plant in tiawan . I believe this may be why so many have trouble with these disks . mmc japan very good ; mmc coded cmc taiwan - watch out .  
1	  This is a horrible card reader . It physically damages the cards ( both XD and SD ) . I just lost half my pictures from Egypt . Good job Targus . SPEND THE MONEY TO BUY SOMETHING BETTER ! ( I would have done a video review , but ( 1 ) there would have been a lot of swearing and ( 2 ) I couldn't get it off my camera anyway . )  
1	  As of the day I bought this , early February , 2010 , the Amazon blurb said " The Back-UPS CS provides professional-grade power protection for office and home office systems . " and " These features along with its classic styling make the Back-UPS CS a perfect choice for protecting your important office and home office systems . " Lulled by this assurance , I did not realize that 230V is not just a harmless part of the name like BK500 or 500VA or even 300W . So I ordered and upon delivery found reference in the literature to " Valid in Australia only " . What ? They have 240 Volt power . I am in the US ! So right before wrecking my computer , I checked again . To my surprise , some companies use 220 to 260 volt office equipment in North America and some ship to foreign subsidiaries . So " 230 volt " is sold for use here and for export , but average Amazon customers here should be EXPLICITLY WARNED and not misled . Back it goes and the vendor charges a restocking fee plus I pay shipping both ways . Oh , the joy of buying on the internet . Pitfalls abound , even with legitimate retailers . It 's easy to say " You should have known that 230V means 240 volts before you bought it . " Well , it did not occur to me at the time and I am annoyed by the careless , deceptive blurb . This product is not made for North American home office systems . Amazon 's description is wrong and misleading . At least I did not destroy my computer . Thank you for nothing , Amazon !  
2	  I use this mouse with my HP Pavilion dv9500t laptop running Windows Vista Home Premium . So far this mouse has worked flawlessly . I had heard that wireless routers and mice sometimes interfere with each other but I have not had any problems . Setup was easy . I didn't install the software that comes with the mouse . Instead , I double clicked my laptop 's bluetooth icon and followed the instructions . I was up and running in less than two minutes . The mouse is a bit smaller than I 'm used to , but this is not a problem . I like that a carrying case is included and that it has an on / off switch to conserve battery power . Excellent product .  
2	  Okay I had to add to put in my two cents here . I saw everyone 's setup horror stories with this product and decided to buy it anyway , because it was exactly what I was looking for and was up to the challenge . I actually found this product to be fairly plug and play after reading a couple very helpful tips in the reviews of the product on other sites . I will however note that I own a Linksys wireless G router . Okay the instructions for the Music Bridge are horrible because they leave out 1 important point which ends up confusing the hell out of people , especially those who would typically consider themselves savvy with computers . In the directions they tell you to plug your desktop ( or laptop ) to the music bridge via ethernet . Even though this sounds weird , do it anyway . Then after you get the software installed and setup , unplug the ethernet cable from your computer and then plug it into your wireless router and then plug the bridge into your stereo receiver with the included RCA cables . You should be good to go from there . I am using this with Rhapsody . com and it works great and is exactly what I needed . btw , Rhapsody for Tivo is clunky and terrible , which is why I decided to get the music bridge so I can stream music from my laptop straight to my stereo wirelessly .  
2	  Good set of comfortable in ear phones . Inexpensive , & comfortable ! My only drawback on them is the bass . Ive never been a big fan of lots of bass , and these phones kick out more than what I am used to . But for $ 6 , I am impressed .  
2	  It has many compartments to put the necessary equipment and or papers for a school teacher to bring to work with .  
1	  I had the same problem - lock " magically " reset itself and the combination I had been using for 1 year no longer worked . Fortunately , I was able to cut it off in 3 minutes with a hacksaw . Unfortunately , I am out $ 10 for the hacksaw and $ 30 for the lock . Here are the instructions for cutting the lock off that Targus doesn't post on the website , but will email to you : Obtain a hacksaw from a hardware store or similar location . Make sure that it has a high-speed metal cutting blade . After stabilizing the tail of the DEFCON CL in a vise , saw through the head . Do not try to saw the teeth of the DEFCON CL , it is much easier to begin sawing at the gap next to the cable attachment ring . After sawing all the way through , you will be able to take apart DEFCON CL and remove it from the notebook . This should take an average of 10 minutes .  
1	  Cheap , spray-painted plastic cabinet and poor picture quality . Sound was tinny and cheap . Picture exhibited ghosting effects due to slow panel speed . Should have spent a little more for a name brand . Customer service was practically non-existant .  
2	  I ordered the Canon Wireless Remote Control RC1 for Digital Rebel on a Saturday and was using it on Thursday afternoon . The unit works flawlessly . DBROTH is an outstanding source to purchase electronics from .  
2	  I had the Belkin flip cover case first , but had problems with it due to not being able to connect my giffin remote to it . I returned it and bought this one . I liked the first one much better , but functionally , this works for me . Although I may have to cut out the clear section for the controls . It doesn't seem to lay flat enough for me to use it as well as I 'd like . I don't mind the snug fit as much because I won't have the bottom closed as much due to my remote . Overall , it 's not a bad case , but for looks and protection I preferred the flip cover . Again , this works for me when it comes to the functionality .  
2	  I have tried noise cancelling headphones before purchasing this one . This still works better as far as eliminating outside noise is concern ; and sound quality is good too . The only problem , or should I say , issue , is that it takes some effort to put them on properly ; and it will never be as convenient as putting on a regular pair of headphones . If you like to , or need to , constantly removing and putting them on , then you are better off with noise cancelling headphones .  
2	  This is the best IR to RF converter I have purchased and I have had a few . It allowed me to get rid of a couple of cable boxes and still allows me to change channels from anywhere in the house including on the deck outside . At $ 8 a month per box it will pay for it 's self in a few months . Also works well with my stereo equipment . Has a very good range of view .  
2	  ITs good .. its ok .. Its nice and cormfortable , but i never knew a 17in bag was like tat big and im only 14 .. so .. the bag felt big and long .. but if ur 17 + it would be good .. Design is great .. Cormforatble .. feature . ss .. wat else u need .. justa buy it .. Its good .. comes with warranty too ! LOL .. G2gFeeli like i have no life  
1	  This piece of garbage sounds like one of those old transistor radios you might have had as a kid . You are better off opening your window if you want to hear bird sounds . I might have expected the radio to sound bad , but it made the cds sound like 8-track tapes . Ended up buying a Sony from Amazon for only $ 10 more .  
2	  FROM ALASKA TO CHICAGO , IL TO DAYTONA BEACH , FL AND TO MICHIGAN AND BACK . THE GARMIN C550 WAS JUST AWESOME ! NO COMPLAINTS , MONEY WELL SPENT !  
2	  el producto es de muy buena calidad y cumpli & oacute ; con todos mis expectativas y mas muy buena calidad z z  
1	  Ordered two of these to replace my aging stock batteries . Neither of them work . Buyer beware on these .  
1	  I 've had plenty of ear buds in my life , from $ 10 Sony 's , to $ 100 dollar , well , Sony 's , and they all sounded better than these . I got them for free , and I 'm still disappointed . I can't believe they cost almost $ 150 dollars ! Their sound is EXTREMELY dull , they have a base setting , that doesn't produce base . It doesn't matter what kind of music I listened to , it ruined it all . I gave them to my dog as a new play toy . They have ruined my life ( that 's not true , but they are terrible ) .  
2	  Bought two of these in August 2008 from Amazon for six dollars at the time . I still use mine and have not had any signal deterioration or quality loss . At least , that I can tell , and I 'm on a 40 " 1080p HDTV connected to a PS3 . Quality of picture and sound same as any HDMI cable on the market - tested it against my friend 's Monster cables and saw no difference . Be careful , though , with how you handle it . The metal end of one of the two cables I bought got stuck in my LCD 's HDMI slot - probably my fault because I forced it in when it wasn't going in easily . I was careful with the other cable I bought , and had no problem . Just don't be forceful . Value is unbeatable . Now that they 're dirt cheap , there 's no reason not to buy a good handful as long as the shipping price stays the same . Seriously one of the best buys I 've made on Amazon .  
2	  I use this gps holder on my mountain bike and it supports very well all kind of abuse , hits on the ground , vibrations , etc . Very well made product with a strong plastic and a hard fix to the bike .  
2	  I would drone on and on , but there are many great reviews already posted . I bought this remote and replaced many older remotes with far fewer features . The most important feature of this remote is the signal is far more powerful than any remote I have ever owned . I am able to reach the equipment from bouncing off of walls without too much difficulty .  
2	  It works . I use it daily . Does exactly what it says . Helped out tremendously . Good stuff here . Glad I could get it .  
1	  This charger worked fine .. for the first couple of months . One day , it just stopped working entirely . There is nothing visibly wrong-it just won't charge my laptop . Frustrating !  
2	  I paid 40 dollars too much at best buy , aside from that , it seems to be a nice little unit . The screen resolution is pretty good , excellent with cartoons and animated videos for the kids . ( the only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars ) The battery is a small lightweight thing and is amazing at how long it lasts . ( which bumps it back up to 5 stars ) The car head rest mount is really nice also . I 've even plugged this into the sound system on my Harley Davidson Electra Glide ( plug it in just like an iPod ) , and played a Pink Floyd Concert at our campsite over the weekend ! Hopefully the " HO3 " Error that a few people were talking about won't surface . This should keep the youngins occupied during our long plane trip to Europe this summer .  
2	  I bought this binocular for music concerts . The foucus is clear and the eye fatigue for long time use is minimal . A good binocular for me .  
2	  The bulb on our tv burnt out on Father 's Day morning ! Bad timing .. but we ordered on a sunday and received it on Wednedsay ! Very happy with the FAST shipping and excellent product we recieved .. good service with great instructions . Very happy with this purchace and seller and will definitely use them again !  
1	  PEOPLE BEFORE YOU BUY A PAIR OF V MODA VIBES READ THIS ! I have owned 3 pairs of V moda vibes . The first 2 were from the 1st generation . I lost the channel in 1 ear IN BOTH OF THEM after only 3-4 months of usage . This is because the bend of the wire eventually caused it to tear ( you could hear in both ears only when you bent the wire back at a specific angle ) However the sound quality was really good for the price so I decided to give the 2nd gen a try when it came out . They had made the audio plug at an angle instead of straight like the 1st gen , so i thought that the problem was fixed .. What do you know .. 4 months later , I lost sound again in the left ear .. same problemFolks , the sound quality is great , they are super comfy .. but they dont last .. I spend almost 300 dollars on these and they didnt last over a year .  
1	  Headband is not adjustable . Would not fit me . Had to return the product .  
1	  Most credit cards ( Amex , Visa ) offer loss and damage protection , and extended warranty protection . Amex , for example , doubles the manufacturer 's warranty up to and for at least 1 year . Research your credit card benefits before investing 20-25 % of the product cost in extended warranty protection . I think it 's worthless .

2	  As the other writers have said , this bag will hold it all . It is very customizable and you can fit a variety of lenses inside . From your smaller lenses and up . One thing the photos don't show is the size of it-it is much larger than it appears in the images . The designers were also generous in terms of compartments . The only knock on this bag , and it really isn't that bad , is that there is not much protection for the camera . This could be remedied by using a " lens " wrap near where the camera sits to offer some additional protection . The quality of the bag is excellent and as an example is the nice touch of using a " shielded " zipper on the camera compartment . Want weatherproofing for it-store a garbage bag in one of the many storage pockets . For features / price you can't beat it . With the money you save , go ahead and order a small " grab " type bag or top loader for those quick trips and keep your backpack for gear storage and longer photo expeditions .  
2	  It is always really nerve-racking for me to make these kind of purchases because half the reviews for most products say " greatest thing ever , " and the other half " terrible ! " But the reviews seemed pretty good for the Zen 60 gb , so I decided to order it about 8 months ago . So far , so good . It has held up incredibly well . And the 60 gbs of space is hard to fill . I am up to 45 gb , and I have everything I could imagine wanting on it already ! The thing I like most about this player may simply be the fact that it supports so many formats . The major concern I had with getting an MP3 player ( and the reason why I didn't get an Ipod ) is whether or not my various video files and sound files would be difficult to get on here . And , it isn't hard at all . I have had zero problems now with the various formats of videos I download offline and whatnot , and it supports my music file of choice , WMA , perfectly . It would be cool if it supported WMA PRO , but apparently NOTHING does yet .. or at least nothing I have seen . I love the program it comes with . IT couldn't be easier . I select my music from my music folder , and load it right in . It could not be any simpler . I do not use it to compress music - my Windows media player does a great job at that - but I simply use the program to add files that have already been ripped onto my computer . Battery space is very good - I have yet to not have enough battery power for the various times I have used it . It was great when I flew to hawaii . I switched between listening to music and watching movies without running out of battery power . It seems to go about 3-4 hours on video depending on the loudness of volume . Obviously that exceeds the length of most movies . But the other thing I would HIGHLY recommend is getting a wall plug in and car adapter . I cannot stress how nice it has been to be able to charge this in my car , from a wall , and from my computer . Basically , there is hardly ever a time when I have to worry about it running out of battery power , because I can always charge it , from anywhere . I plug it in my mp3 line on my car , and listen endlessly . When I took a major road trip with my girlfriend , I listened to ( and she watched ) through a couple different movies . It was awesome ! So far so good with battery power , memory , and functionability . It looks like at 192 kbps , I can fit about 600 full length albums on here , along with about 70 vids . Hard to tell . Right now I have 440 albums at 192 kbps , and 70 vids , and I am I still have 15 gbs left .  
2	  This item really cleans up your audio feed from your sirius to your car radio . Eliminates bleed over when you drive by another radio transmitter , which I have to do daily . I used to get feedback on my Sirius , once I installed this , it dsappeared . It even keeps out bleed when you are in the area of a radio station of the same frequency you have set your Sirius FM Trx to .  
2	  Lois McMaster Bujold has demonstrated a talent in her many books for having middle-aged characters fall in love ( " Shards of Honor " , " Falling Free " , " A Civil Campaign " ) . She 's also well-known for creating damaged - but not broken - heroes and heroines who pull victory from the jaws of defeat at the last moment . These talents have held her in good stead in her Miles Vorkosigan science fiction series , but they perhaps even serve her better in " The Curse of Chalion " , Bujold 's second fantasy novel . Her protagonist , far from being another Miles Vorkosigan , actually reminds me a bit of a cross between Brother Cadfael from Ellis Peters ' series of the same name and her avuncular spymaster Simon Illian from the Vorkosigan novels - a kindly , frustrated teacher with a worldly past who follows his cause to and past the point of selflessness . This character is definitely unique , though he shares the same spark of and for life that so many of her other characters have . The story is one of unexpected boons and dangers , familiar danger ( from within and without ) , intrigue , love and trust . Her world is better put together than many multi-novel series I have read and her religion system is surprisingly well thought out . The narrative is strung together surprisingly well and weaves to a wonderfully well-choreographed ending . I really can't recommend this novel enough . It 's got the political and social cohesion of a George R. R. Martin novel , the heart of an Orson Scott Card novel and the humanity of , well , a Bujold novel . It is , however , it 's own unique entity and stands quite well on it 's own merits . If you 're a Bujold fan that 's skittish of her non-Vorkosigan Saga stuff , I definitely recommend giving this a shot . If you 're a fantasy fan that 's a little wary of reading fantasy from a science fiction author , I also recommend trying it . I recommend this to everyone , really , but I am hard-pressed to think of other types of readers that would need cajoling to read it . " The Curse of Chalion " is simply the best fantasy novel I have read this year . While I look forward to more from the Miles Vorkosigan universe , I hope she returns to this one someday as well .  
1	  We purchased this HDMI cable based on the reviews . We thought this would be a good product . Well , apparently it is just a cheap cable and it does not support the new Smart HDTV 's . We originally had it hooked up to an older HDTV and we could watch there . But when we hooked it up to our new smart HDTV , it said on screen that the HDMI cable does not support this tv and it does not support that high of resolution . Wish I knew I could return and get my money back . This was a complete waste ! We went to Best Buy and bought some monster cables that support our new TV-they said a lot of the HDMI cable on amazon do not support the high resolution of new tv 's . Wish I had known that first before spending money on this . Lesson Learned .  
1	  very cheap construction , doesn't hold camera unless you screw it in really tightly , which causes the tripod to fall apart . If that 's fine with you , then this tripod is great !  
2	  I bought mine factory refurbed : came with auto bundle . About the battery 's short life : there 's an after market battery upgrade that I found listed here in amazon . com link : $U$ ad says 1500 mAh @ 3.7V so that 's triple the OEM bayyery ! The battery cost about $ 25 and comes with two screwdrivers and instructions on taking the iQue3600 apart . WARNING : taking the Garmin will void your garmin warranty .. SO BE WARNED ! All in all , I am having a great time with the GPS on my travels . around the USA .  
1	  My review is that when you by something , and you always stick with a brand you trust j . v . c and your d . v . d player goes south within 3 months and 1day that really sucks but i thought it was just bad luck untill i seen your reviews on this product thank you john  
2	  This machine is perfect for the second TV in the bedroom . Yes , the remote could have been laid out better , but once you 're familiar with it it 's fine .  
2	  I purchased this tripod in early 2004 ( it 's now Nov . 2011 ) to use for holding my spotting scope while out birding . After 7 years , I 've finally decided to upgrade to another brand . Generally speaking , it was a decent tripod . However , don't get the leg clamps wet without drying them off .. they will rust ! It was usually stable , although it wasn't heavy enough to withstand strong winds when I had the center column all the way up . After ~ 5 1/2 years the clamps cracked ( presumably from repeated exposure to cold , wet conditions ) and the legs started to slide when they were " locked . " All in all , it was a good tripod for a long time !  
1	  I bought this through Amazon from another retiler . It was an open box item so I cant return it . I have it connected to a very nice antenna but cant receive any signals at all . It makes white noise , but thats it . I checked inside the case to see if there were any loose connections , but didnt see any . Also , the channel selector is sloppy , it sometimes skips a channel , then you have to go back . The PA output is not very loud .  
2	  Just opened the box 20 min ago . Pop in different kinds of DVD disc and MP3 disc as well as DivX disc . All run flawlessly . The main reason for me to buy this player is to have DivX play , also , the new wma play feature is attractive . One issue though , when playing MP3 , it can't allow random playing ! For those who have 100 + songs on one disc , this is very inconvenient . It is purely a software / firmware issue and should have been solved long time ago . Same happens to JPG play back , but it is less hassle . Overall , it is a neat machine . Haven't tried the progressive scan since all component inputs are back of my TV . Should be good . The video / audio quailty is good , well , up to my anticipation .  
1	  I wanted an iPod for years and finally bought one . I had already downloaded iTunes and burned 1700 of my favorite songs onto my laptop in AAC format , so when I bought the iPod I was all ready to load songs . Too bad the hard drive failed loading the songs . OK . Took to the Apple Genius who gave me a new one . It died too . Spent hours scanning the internet for fun tricks to try to get the stupid thing to work , but never could fix it . Never actually listened to a song on the damn thing so who knows what it sounds like . Apple did refund my money , but what do I do with the 1700 songs in AAC format ? I dread loading all those songs again !  
2	  If you plan on buying a tripod and setting up some lighting for a particular shot and are considering to have the mirror locked up to reduce any shake , then take another step and get this remote trigger . It does have a limited range . So , if you want to take pictures of yourself and find that the remote is not really triggering the shots at your will , don't be surprised . Use the timer instead . $ 20 is not much of a price to pay for a product that can sometimes make the difference between a castaway and a keeper picture .  
2	  Pros : Easily accessible equipment , Lightweight , Well padded . Cons : NoneI use this product to hold and protect my Sony Cybershot W350 and it does do a fantastic job at that . The pocket in the front is very small and I believe is best used for an extra memory card in a little plastic case . This case is made out of a great material and gives great protection on the inside but is soft to the touch on the front , in addition it looks elegant . I actually have a bigger Sony cybershot case that has a shoulder strap that I put this case into . It fits perfectly inside the other case leaving no room to move around and it is safe to keep my camera extra protected . That other case comes with more room with two extra pockets for batteries and things like that . So all in all they work wonderfully together . Great Protection !  
2	  Good high , Good bass , good sound in general . Great guarantee , great price . Good for listening without blocking ambient sounds , like for jogging .  
1	  When using headphones , these speakers are plagued by annoying white noise ( hissing ) in the background . The hissing sound is not a function of volume ( turn the volume completely off and the noise is still there ) , but goes away only when the speakers are shut off . My officemate 's Harmon Kardon speaker system does not have this problem . Just now , I bought the Creative Labs SBS270 , and I 'm sending the Accent system back .  
2	  I bought this refurbished and the price was much lower than new . It is factory conditioned and tested and since they lack moving parts and are intended for years of use with a warranty I had nothing to lose . With this gateway I am not paying the cable company lease charges on the cheapest modem they can acquire and I have consolidated two components into one .  
1	  This speaker is good only at this price point . If at any higher than what it is , it 'd make it not worth it . I 'll review it based on the price first . The build quality of the frame looks very good . Feels like it 'll last for a long time . The woofers are said made of polypropylene which feels like heavy paper . Again for the price , it 's good . As for the sound , for the price again , it sounds acceptable . You will probably not find any better sounding speaker at this price point . This doesn't have any circuitry ( crossover ) behind the speaker at all , hence the front only picture . The back side of the speaker has some " cheap " feel / look to it but I 'm guessing that 's necessary for their price target . Now comparing it to a slightly more expensive competition , to a yamaha priced at $ 20 dollars higher ( IW280C ) . The sound of this speaker is lacking bass and clarity compared to the said yamaha . I compared them side by side using same speaker wires and on the floor before install . This pyle performed acceptable though considering it doesn't have crossover behind it but still way below yamaha 's especially in terms of clarity . On yamaha I could hear vibrating guitar strings more clearly and also the swoosh of the wind blowing were more noticeable than they were on this speakers . Now for people looking for very shallow round speaker , this is for you . It 's only about 3.5 inch deep because of lack of circuitry behind ( crossover ) . You won't find any shallower round speaker than that . For me , I had special need for shallow one and this one fit perfect . Now , the 2 stars , it 's because it performed significantly lower than the slightly expensive competition . Maybe 4 times lower . It 's not angled speakers ( a must for surround ) , no circuitry behind ( to help on sound routing ) , paper-like woofers ( easier to blow out ) , not enough bass ( for deeper feel ) , not enough richness ( for hi def feel ) , and cheap wire connectors ( to make good signal transfer ) . Not worth the $ 20 savings against yahama 's cheapest model . There 's no doubt that this is the best at this price point . Pyle has been making car speakers for years and this is what it exactly looks , feels , and sounds like . Remember though that cars have different acoustics than living rooms that 's why speakers in your car sound fantastic . But in open areas , they won't perform as well . In your car you are " sandwiched " between speakers while in living room you are showered with sound ( with ceiling speakers ) . My recommendation , add extra couple bucks to go to the next cheapest , so you leap yourself forward to a future-proofer system . No extra couple of bucks ? Hold off and save . Can't hold off anymore ? Then this is the perfect speaker for you . No doubt . I hope this is helpful enough for people trying to decide .  
2	  This is a great backpack . The reason I bought is because of the durable zipper which broke on another Targus backpack I had . Beware , you can't fit much into this one !  
1	  reading its features and manual was not difficult , however try uploading music to the sansa mp3 and then you would know about problems . it 's supposed to be compatible with windows millenium but guess what ? ; it 's not . i think adding a couple dollars more and purchasing something from apple would have been worth the while . thnks .  
2	  This is an awesome micro fiber cloth , much better for your electronics than a paper towel or regular wash cloth which can leave pieces on your screen which is vary annoying ! I use this for every screen I have and recommend this to anyone with a computer / tv that they do not want damaged .  
1	  I purchased the cradle for an X5L 30 GB iAudio by Cowan . Although I had checked the Cowan site for the cradle , nothing implied that the X5L would NOT fit in the X5 cradle . When the cradle arrived from Amazon , the iAudio would not fit . I wish I had known there was a different cradle . Unfortunately , no one seems to carry a cradle for X5L so if you want one , I guess you are out of luck . Amazon was great in taking the item back , paying the shipping cost . Amazon gets 5 stars .  
2	  I bought this bag for myself and I like that it is not bulky and it take less time for me to pack up and move out . It is simple and lightweight . I love it , and it is pretty .  
2	  Having had a D2-60GB for four years and still counting , decided to add the D2-160Gb as a second storage and back-up device for my iMac . Easy to set up - hooked up the included power and FW400 cables , booted up the iMac and voila ! - instant recognition . Partitioned the disc into two volumes to keep operating system and audio / video files separated and began transfer of data from the iMac to the D2-160GB . No problems whatsoever - unit runs very quietly with occasional muted clicking noises when reading / writing .. very unobjectionable . And in the stand-up position , disc saves on desk space . All in all , a great product that gives great satisfaction and security .  
1	  If you want a basic simple road navigation device do not be fooled by the other reviews and do not buy a TOMTOM ONE or TOMTOM ONE XL . I chose to buy the TOMTOM ONE XL after reading the other reviews unfortunately they do not reveal two major flaws ! First off - there is no way to control and lock the zoom in level while navigating . You can zoom out briefly but it will automatically zoom back in really close - it doesn't give me much advantage over what I see out my windshield . The second thing there is no way to make up to be north on the screen while navigating - it keeps rotating the map as you make turns ( very irritating especially while driving in the mountains ) . I 'm not sure how most people read maps , but I know I usually make north to be up . I contacted TOMTOM on both these issues . First via email and was told that the touch screen had a problem ( concerning the zooming in issue ) and it needed to be returned for repair . I exchanged it with the retailer due to it being defective and got another one . The second ended up doing the same thing . I then contacted TOMTOM via the phone and was told the zooming in issue was normal as well as well as the orientation of the maps while navigating and the only way to have north being up and control of your zoom in level is to put it in " browse map " mode - but you loose your navigation functions if you do so . I am very disappointed with this product and will probably give it away .  
2	  Relatively easy to install very clean look after it is installed . It is nice to have a little bit of extra storage now .  
1	  I bought this Zune for each one of my children ( basically I bought 2 ) because they were on super sale before christmas and I was able to get it for 79.99 which I thought was a great price . The screen was great , the music quality was good , and they loved the option to listen to the radio . However 2 months after christmas the Zunes quit charging no matter where I tried to plug them in I brought them to work I tried all 3 pc 's at my house , it was a nightmare . Then when I finally got my sons charged and tried to play it it completely froze . Never did get my daughters charged . So I called microsoft and spoke to a representative in there help center . After a 45 minute call where he had me do everything I had done at least 10 times before . He agreed to send me the packages to send them back to be fixed or replaced . I sent the Zunes back in the pre-paid fed-ex packages they sent about a month ago and have heard nothing since . So I will be calling them soon . But for others I would definetely suggest another route as this product just didn't last even for the price I paid it wasn't worth it .  
1	  Product never got voltage above 84 and burned out a ceiling fan . Was told by support that voltage was OK and that I need a true RMS volt meter to accurately measure it 's voltage - guess the ceiling fan couldn't read the true voltage either  
2	  I ordered this HK AVR 645 receiver from JR 's Music World using standard shipping . The receiver was delivered within 3 days in perfect condition . The AVR 645 is fantastic . The best sound I ever heard . If you compare specs with other receivers you may think the AVR is underpowered , rated at 75W / channel vs 100 + W / channel for most others . But you 'd be wrong . The AVR 645 is a very high powered receiver . Just compare the weight difference : 41 + lbs for the AVR 645 vs about 28 lbs for most other receivers . This isn't because of the cabinet - it 's the huge amp in the AVR . This baby puts out some power . I get postive comments from all our friends and family . Couldn't be happier !  
1	  I paid for 1-3 day shipping . It 's been 7 days and I 'm still waiting and I have no way to track the item  
2	  So good that my wife didn't even realize there was a filter on her new lens ! Would buy again . Fits securely and is crystal clear .  
2	  These thingies are the perfect answer to tangled headsets . I got extra to pass out to my friends when they envy mine .  
2	  I never thought having a remote control for a fan would be a big deal , but I love this one . I think that having a convenient way to adjust the fan oscillation and speed will keep me from adjusting the thermostat on the Air Conditioner this Summer , and that will add up to real savings . The design is very efficient , giving a powerful and versatile fan the same footprint as a small desk fan . I find the " wind " variable speed setting to be a little annoying , but it 's an option that might appeal to some . I 'd also like to see a sturdier pedestal , but so far it seems to be standing tall , and functioning perfectly .  
2	  It 's not as good as my other cameras which cost three and four times as much , but still a decent camera . Skype use is OK . Low-light sensitivity is almost non-existent . The only issue I 'm having once in a while is that Logitech software cannot recognize that the camera is plugged in and asks to re-plug it back into the PC , even though it 's plugged in and I have no problem using it with Skype . I bought 3 Logitech cameras in the last two months and the software / drivers on all of them was outdated . So , before using your new camera make sure you have the latest version of software / drivers ( download from Logitech if needed ) .  
1	  This one-button mouse for the Mac has only an ADR port and no adaptor to connect the mouse to a USB port on a newer Mac . I 've tried four times to contact the seller to return it and am still waiting for a response . If anyone has any way of getting an RAN from the seller , that would be greatly appreciated as I already purchased another mouse , since the mouse I previously had died , and this Macally was supposed to be a replacement for the one that broke . I thought that this mouse would have come with the proper adaptor to connect it to my newer computer , but it was nowhere to be found in either the packaging or the box . The Apple Store thought it was a PS / 2 type . When I went to Staples to buy this type of adaptor and try it out , it would not fit this mouse . It is therefore unusable and is in need of being returned to the seller for a complete refund .  
2	  Let me start out by stating that I 'm a professional photographer and I only buy B + W filters . However , I have two experiences to share . One is regarding the type of filter and the other is purchasing from NY based companies . Rest assured that I have based my rating on the filter and not the merchant . Regarding the filter : I 've rated this particular filter as only 4 stars because it is not one of B & Ws ; MRC filters which deserve 5 stars . Basically , their MRC filters have multiple coatings that reduce reflections ( like most glass elements in your lens ) while this particular filter does not . I highly recommend MRC filters especially when using high quality lenses . If you 've paid a small fortune you don't want to skimp on the filter as the old " Weakest link in the chain " analogy definitely applies here . I found this out the hard way when I decided to save money and skip multi-coating on my second pair of glasses . When watching a movie I could see my eyes reflecting back at me via the uncoated lenses I was wearing ! Regarding NY based electronics retailers : I accidentally ordered this exact filter ( I assumed I was ordering the MRC version ) on amazon through the third-party seller , cambridgeworld1 on January 30th of 2011 . Luckily , amazon sent me a cancelation notice yesterday ( 2/4/11 ) explaining that it was due to the item being " out of stock " . However , as I write this review , cambridgeworld1 is still showing this item as in-stock . So .. what 's my point ? After 10 years of purchasing camera gear from several NY based merchants , I finally narrowed down my orders to one establishment - B & H ; Photo Video . The reason for this is that I 've found almost all of the NY based photo stores that I 've dealt with ( 6 or 7 of the majors ) to engage in somewhat less than honorable business practices in one form or another . And I 've been purchasing camera gear from NY since 1994 . Now , B & H ; is not perfect . They 're not the cheapest and they close down too often for my liking ( religious observances , I believe . ) but I never have to worry about sketchy claims regarding product availability or pricing like some of the others . However , a few years ago , in my pursuit of the perfect merchant - yes , I know there 's no such thing - my gaze turned to amazon and I 've never looked back . Until now ! Foolishly , perhaps , I 've ignored my past " direct " experiences with amazon 's third-party sellers due to amazon 's great customer service . However , this recent order has made me rethink that practice and it 's partly amazon 's fault by not providing an avenue for leaving third-party feedback regarding cancelations . If I 'm wrong on this one I 'd appreciate someone pointing it out . If I 'm correct on this feedback issue then it 's rather disconcerting . Just think about it ! You 're a third-party seller that decides to show a product as available that isn't ( I 'm not saying cambridgeworld1 did this as I have no way to know ) . But you do so because you know that if you happen to get the item in stock then you 'll make a sale . If it doesn't arrive on time then you simply cancel the order at the last minute and avoid a bad rating from the buyer even though you 've left them hanging for a week . From now on , I think I 'll order from amazon as long as it 's directly from them or the third-party seller is B & H. ; If not then I 'll order directly from B & H ; or walk into my local Samy 's Camera here in Los Angeles . ckEDIT : I just received a call from cambridgeworld1 today ( 3/10/11 ) stating that the item was back in stock and available if I was still interested . That 's 34 days since they canceled my order ! Why is this significant , you ask ? Because I 've checked on this item several times over the past weeks since I posted my review above and every time they showed either 1 or 2 left in stock .  
2	  I bought this receiver cause it had a very low price . I just wanted to replace my time damaged Clarion receiver and didn't have enough money to get another of the same brand . I thought this would be a 4-6 weeks temporary radio while I got the money but now it 's staying right where it is . I like the way it sounds and it 's pretty easy to set up . If for some reason you have to disconnect your car 's battery you can set the radio to your likings in less than 2 minutes . The controls are easy to understand and not hard to reach while you are driving . The anti skip feature of the CD player has been tested in virtually destroyed roads , and it has performed great . It doesn't get the 5 stars rate just because its lights are very bright while driving at night . Edit : I dismounted the faceplate and covered the back of the buttons using some white nail polish . Now the glare is in the past . I recommend this console even if you have the money for a more expensive one .  
2	  The build is much better than the kenko tubes , that flex with longer lenses . True , Nikon did not update their adapter tubes in a long while , but if you use them with older lenses , the nikon tubes work just fine .  
2	  Purchased for use in a school library with multiple users ( 100 + ) and with various DVD players . Disc Skins save our DVDs from wear and tear and keep them in good condition . They work with any DVD player except the kind with the slot that " sucks in " the CD or DVD as you start to feed it into the slot . Highly recommend this product , especially in schools or in families with children and teens .  
1	  Do not buy . It worked fine the first two weeks . Then it stopped . The power save mode kills this product . I would avoid any JBL product that uses this feature .  
1	  What arrived was a 256mb memory stick duo , had to return it and still awaiting right item  
2	  I bought this device because travelling in the USA can be extremly stressful . I found to my amazement this is a product that truely works from the time you open the box and start it . However , when installing detailed maps for different states I found that you had to activate it , but you do not recieve any information about this in the scarce documentation that comes within the package . To activate go to preferences , switch map and activate there . Once you have done this I found that it worked extremely well . Even when negotiating the new road contrauctions . Despite this small missunderstanding in the documentation I 'm extremely content .  
2	  A few items came before this earphone that have had profound impact in my life .. items like Gillette Fusion or Oral-B Triumph . This yet is another revolutionary product . I am a new dad and have a Sony 40 " LCD . I decided to get this after watching Resident Evil ( to take a break in a mindless reality ) with subtitles and 1-bar sound on TV . Just received this . I held my daughter tonight while watching TV at regular volume with the headset on . She felt asleep soundly on my chest . I screamed miracle inside . Ok . For the audiophiles , I would say this headset is not as good as Grado r60 , but it 's definitely amazing for watching tv wirelessly . I can watch tv with the volume completely down ( perhaps it 's a function of my tv ) and the sound is perfect . The range is great . Having owned a Sony first generation wireless headset ( back in 1992 ) , this range is better . Although I found the infrared Sony wireless had less hiss when you are standing in the line of sight of the headset . The convenience of charging the headset on the cradle is ingenious . The headset is also comfortable to wear for a big headed guy :-) In summary , the combination of sound quality , convenience of hassle-free charging , wireless range , and comfort makes this headset a great buy .  
2	  Was getting a 1080p new tv . Knew I needed cables . So easy to order . I received the cables before I bought the tv .  
2	  Although I was sent the wrong item at first , Amazon and the company the product was coming from quickly identified it and immediately shipped out the correct item , even before I had a chance to notify them of the mistake . The cable works well for it 's intended purpose , connecting my upscaling dvd player to my epson projector and the image is clear without any visible interference . Satisfied with the product and the seller !  
1	  Bought this for my husband for Christmas . It 's May , and we still haven't figured out how to use it .  
2	  Logitech Cordless Desktop LX 710 LaserWhen I purchased on 11/24/1008 cost was [ .. ] with a promised rebate from Logitech of additional [ .. ] . Product extremely easy to install - just plug it in and start working . Keyboard has a little too many extras which I strike by accident but can live with those inconveniences for now . The promised rebate ( Amazon furnished form ) did not materialize . It appears that the company with a Phoenix address went belley-up and Logitech asked someone else to handle for them . Their automated telephone for checking rebate gave me information on TiVo I purchase from Amazon . I lowered from five stars because of the poor support where there is no " live " person to talk to - it must all be accomplished by e-mail . If i had known of the poor support and the difficulty in obtaining the promised rebate I would have purchased a less expensive model without all the frills that I don't need anyway .  
2	  This new version of ergonomic keyboard is SWEET ! I poured coffee into my original one ( 5-8 years old ? ) and was hesitant to order this model . The reviews were mixed . Don't let any negativity prevent you from buying this model ! I have one small request .. wish it had a printed owner 's manual . There are so many improved keys but it would be nice to have the function and possibilities of each spelled out in print for reference . Other than that one little request , this one 's a keeper !  
1	  I bought these radios for work thinking we could communicate through an eight hour shift . Not so . I think we had to recharge these every two hours and it took another three hours to charge . I would not recommend these unless you want to talk for two hours or less .  
2	  Bought this ( from Amazon ) and love it . Wonderful picture and great tuner . Picks up six HDTV stations over the air . Setup was completely automatic . I love it .  
1	  I read previous reviews for this item and thought I 'd found the perfect clock radio for my needs . It arrived-and the clock displays military time , not am / pm . I can't find the way to fix it anywhere in the instructions . So , since there was a big note from Philips enclosed with the item that said " Need help , call us " before you return this product , I called Philips . And I got the worst customer service I have ever received . I was told that although I purchased the clock radio five days ago , the warranty had run out-but I could purchase a new warranty for $ 15 . Then the service rep would reveal to me how to fix the problem . I said " no , thak you " and returned the item . And I don't plan to buy anything from Philips in the future .  
2	  I bought our DVD player from Target over a year ago and it is still doing great ! I really like the bracket that attaches it to the car seat . Seems very secure . Thinking about purchasing this same model for a second car . I have had great luck with it !  
1	  While its Thanksgiving morning and I have a lot to be thankful for , this Netgear switch is not one of them . Unfortuantely I have to take part of my day to return this item as its the last day I can do so . But the short story is that I got this 28 days ago and yesterday I plugged it into my clients network , right out of the box . I plug in Cisco SPA525G2 phones into ports 1,2,3,4 .. Then on port number 5 , the Cisco phone doesn't power up . So I think maybe I over subscribed the switch , but the " MAX PoE " light isn't on and each phone only draws 1.3W when not in use ! To test it out , I unplug port 5 and take the working phone in port 4 and plug it into port 5 - NOTHING ! I plug it into port 6,7,8 and still nothing . Plug it back into port 4 and it works . So its confirmed , the switch shipped with 4 bad PoE ports ! I 've always had great things to say about these Netgear switches , but for netgear to ship a switch with 50 % bad PoE ports , says a lot for their quality control ! Who 's Q / A these products before they go out ? So the customer is left to deal with it ! OK , I 'll get off my soap box . BUT apparently I " m not the first customer to have this problem . So if you order it , make sure you have plenty of time to return it and get another one to meet any kind of time-line that you may have .  
1	  I ordered a Sony Clie Handheld from this seller and he intentionally didn't list that the item is unusable , irrepairable , and worthless . After purchasing the item the seller stated this : " the sony clie has already been sent . As mentioned , it has not been tested and the screen is fixable by sony . go to sonystyle . com for more info . " He then went on to say : " the details on the Sony clie were and has been listed by Amazon since the item was posted . I dont know how you could have missed it . I have attached the link in which all the details were mentioned . $U$ sales are final . " Even after rechecking the seller 's page there was no sign of this link . I e-mailed the seller and he still is standing by his sale , although it is evident and apparent that he falsified the information for this product . Please don't purchase from this seller unless you want to be put in a bind . Retract your purchase immediately by calling your bank and putting a hold on this transaction , at least until your product has been delivered and it is the product you were initially sold .  
2	  I bought these to complement my recently purchased IMAC G5 . They are close in color . For the size and price they sound great and are plenty loud enough for my home office . Recommended  
1	  the sound was good , although I 've had better . I also wear glasses sometimes and it is a hassle when I 'm wearing both . They don't really clip over my ear and whenever I move my hair I end up ripping them off of my ear and it is really annoying . I actually returned this item and bought a different pair . I don't like ear bud pieces so that 's why I decided to buy this pair . They would be good if you didn't wear glasses and if you had bigger ears .  
2	  Excellent prodcut , Easy set up and works great . Much easier setup than previous brand that I used . Saved money buy purchasing at Amazon over Best Buy and bankrupt Circuit City prices .  
2	  Purchased for my son for Christmas , this was a product that he had requested and is very happy with it .  
2	  My husband runs everyday and says this is the best radio he 's ever used . It gets great reception and does not slip when running . I also use onewhile I am walking on the treadmill . I highly recommend this item .  
2	  My only issue with the device are the controls . Could be a little more user friendly . Other than that , it plays great , the sound is perfect and it is extremely durable . Dropped the device , while music was playing , from a distance of about 5 feet straight to the concrete . Picked it up , put the ear buds back in my ears and it hadn't even missed a beat . Music was still playing . No worse for the wear . I recommend this mp3 player .  
1	  A large portion of these cameras will not play back the video they record . Since this is one of the core functions of a camcorder , this product fails miserably . Yes , it has cool features . Yes , the price is great . None of this overcomes the fact that you can't use it to playback recorded video . So far I have had an opportunity to test out three of these cameras and all three failed in the exact same way . What are the chances that the one you buy will have the same problem ? It looks pretty probable .  
1	  I 'm not an idiot . The Zune had a modest rating , throughout the net , of about a 3 . Right in the middle . I figured that the 1 's were Apple Fanboys and the 5 's were Microsoft Fanboys . I also assumed that buying a Zune would be one of the smartest buys of my life . It was 200 bones , looked fire with that big screen , and would go great with my surf-themed everything ( with a brand spaking new surf-themed background ) . It was all working out . I gave it a chance . I installed it . I transfered all my music ( THE MOST STRENUOUS COMPUTER ANYTHING I HAVE EVER DONE ) , let the Zune install 9 programs into my computer , whatever , I gave it a chance . When I get my wallpaper ready , fix my songs , and get ready for playback , I realized I had made the worst mistake of my life . Why was my 2gig pc lagging out ? Why did the Zune still say it was syncing , when it wasn't ? Why is my perfect sized background pixelated to hell ? Why do I have to plug and unplug my Zune everytime I make a change ? Why can't I just drag and drop ? Why is there even a Wi-Fi option ? Why is the Zune Marketplace Interface so obnoxiously slow ? And Ugly ? And useless ? and so useless ? Why are the headphones so gaudy ? WHY DID I BUY THIS ? Needless to say ; It sucked hard . I anticipated this product . I sat at home waiting for it all day . I wanted to like it ; I did . But it sucked . After 2 hours of messing with it , I was happy that I left everything in place because it was ready for a trip back to the amazon warehous . Don't be fooled by the internet . Part of the iPod 's appeal is that it is freaking easy ( not for computer idiots like my grandparents ) so that is is freaking fast . The Zune isn't . Save your money for that new iPod that 's coming out or something . But for the love of god do not buy this product on anylevels . It is garbage . On the brightside , I got a refund . So 5 stars for Amazon , 1 for the Zune .  
2	  Very good lens . I use this lens on my Canon S5 it get 's the job done plus there is a setting in the camera that recongnizes the lens . Just another canon product doing it 's thing . I highly recommend it you can definitely see a difference and since the S5 is known for having some noise in the pictures when using the digital zoom I just turn that off and shoot straight through the converter for flawless pictures .  
1	  CONS : Blurry Photos and Indistinguishable ZoomThis camera was a breeze to get setup and become completely familiar with all features , I did not mind that this camera does not have many features , but the one feature I miss is focus . I am returning this camera because of the poor quality of photo . The LCD shows a great shot , but the computer and television show a different quality . I am going to spend the few extra dollars and get a good camera .  
2	  Nothing wrong this this product . I liked the fact that it was easy to set up and it 's small . I used it for the office .  
1	  I purchased this router for my college bound daughter to use with her laptop . It worked great for about 5 days , then died ( no power ) . Repeated calls to NetGear have gone unanswered . They advise you to leave a call-back number but no one has called back after repeated tries . Look for a manufacturer with better support !  
1	  This was my first noise-canceling headphone purchase . They are verycomfortable headphones and fit perfectly over my large head and ears . However I purchased them for the noise canceling qualities reviewedby other reviewers . I was dis-satisfied by the results however . It has some canceling ability but very little . When I turned them on I heard acomforting hiss from the headphones ( no music playing ) which drownedout background noise but I wouldn't call it canceling . I hadto return the headphones as I expected more . Perhaps I was expectingtoo much . They were probably worth it for there comfort but I wasexpecting more canceling capabilities .  
1	  I purchased the backpack for a month long trip . I was using it for camera gear and a new laptop computer that is 12 " by 8.5 " . The pack is very sturdy and can be adjusted around the shoulders , waist and chest . It also has plenty of storage pockets . Unfortunately , in my opinion , those are the only positives . My first problem was with the velcro compartments in the camerag gear section . They did not fit tight and the velcro was not very strong . After I packed my camera gear ( body , lenses , flash , etc . ) and put the pack on my back , most of the velcro compartments broke loose and the camera gear shifted to the bottom of the pack . If you don't pack it carefully , it can cause damage to the gear . My next issue was the computer compartment . Even though my computer is small , it was a tight squeeze to get it in an out .. but it did fit . Another issue is the overall size . I would say that if you are under 6 feet tall , this pack will be too big for you ( and me ) , even after you adjust all of the straps . Finally , if you plan on traveling by plane with this , forget it . Every airline I was on ( 4 different ones ) gave me grief over the size and weight . On some occasions I had to pull stuff out and cram it in my wife 's carry-on to reduce it 's weight and allow me to cram it into the overhead without breaking anything . On two flights I had to beg and plead to carry it on as opposed to them checking it with the luggage . This pack is a giant red flag when flying ..  
2	  a friend of mine and i were talking about how much we wanted holgas but couldn't find them .. so when i saw this on here i immediately bought two kits , one for me and one for her . and YES IT COMES WITH THE CAMERA . i just wanted to say that . but the whole package is great ! comes with film , batteries , a poster extolling the virtues of lomography , a mini-handbook for the camera itself , incredibly easy to use . and what i think really makes the package is the " HOLGA - life through a plastic lens " book , with Holga enthusiasts , experts and aficionados giving you tips and sharing their images . Such a charming book , breathtaking pictures , and inspiring because it shows you what this cheap little thing is capable of . and they also give you cool little tricks for modifying the camera and different effects you can get and so on . so .. yeah . Buy it !  
1	  Almost feel like made for children 's hands . I have reg sized women 's hands and would get cramps after using these . Have another 2 button Logitech mouse ( w / out the cute zebra stripes ) and love it so I thought I was safe in ordering these . Cannot keep . description should say they are minis . Roller is also very gravelly feeling & does not move smoothly . Returning the 2 I bought with a sad heart bc the zebra design is so darn cute . RATS ! Back to my old boring mouse ..  
1	  The installation utility provided with this adapter loads the wrong device driver and even the Manufacturers updated utility provided on the internet loads the incorrect device driver . We had to edit the installation routine to force it to load the correct device driver in order to get the adapter recognized by the computer and functioning properly . That is ridiculous .  
2	  Good product and works great ! The only thing , the box on the wire gets warm to touch . Other than that one thing , I 'm glad I found this product .  
1	  It 's a good idea , however the rubber is too soft and the cords don't stay in the notches . I have to wrap the whole bundle with a rubber band and now it looks bulky , well , because it is bulky .  
1	  On the plus side , the hardware is an amazing value . When it works , it 's kind of cool . In theory , it will work with most modern VGA interfaces without any special video cables or connectors . It would have been nice if it had built in audio support instead of depending on your sound card . Perhaps that would eliminate the high pitched noise I get during a capture . Beware that this card will be replaced by the PCTV Pro which supports stereo and FM radio . The Pro seems to have been available in Europe for several YEARS so the US seems to be a second class market for this company . Also the Web site is a real disaster for driver updates . Just visit the user forum and see the mass anger and dissatisfaction . Why do I know this ? Because my PCTV frequently crashes when scanning for new channels . Granted I have played around with a lot of video drivers , but why can't reinstalling their drivers fix driver problems ? If you have a very clean , brand new Windows 98 installation , it will probably work better for you , but do you want to dedicate a PC just for this card ? Then there 's software , without which of course hardware is useless . The card comes with a CD that has 1.01 software . The TV viewing sw is very poor . 1.03 software is better but Pinnacle makes it remarkably difficut to get . One of the things I most want to do with this card , now that I have a big hard disk , is use my PC as a VCR . Their VCR functionality is quite lacking . I am so dissatisfied that I just ordered an ATI TV Wonder along with an ATI Fury Rage Pro . ATI seems to understand the value of VCR function and their VGA card has special hardware support to provide high quality video capture and play back , as well as DVD playback . I didn't get an All In Wonder because I want to upgrade to a DTV card when they become available . ATI 's Fury line is the only one I know of with iDCT and motion compensation and these features make a big difference in handling video . Because Pinnacle does not make VGA cards , their software does not use any hardware acceleration even if it is available . I also suspect they do not want a low end product like PCTV to be very good at video capture or it would hurt the market for their $ 1,000 and up products .  
2	  I was looking for an inexpensive way to play my ipod through my home theater system or any speakers and i found it here .. great sound quality , takes about 15 seconds to connect .. had no issues EXCEPT finding a way to connect it to a stereo that doesn't have 2 auxiliary in connections , only one audio in connection .. i 'm sure there 's a way to connect it to that as well using other connections , but this worked perfectly with the home theater system it was originally intended for !  
1	  This frame is just ok you have to resize all your pictures and the quality is not good at all you are just better off paying the extra $ 75 and getting the phillips  
1	  After 2 1/2 years the light display engine went out and will cost $ 1200 to fix . This is horrible , and I will never buy another Samsung product .  
2	  this worked perfectly for me , I had my first dust spots after 2 years so didn't want to spend a fortune . This little packet did the job fits in my camera case and in 10 mins my spots were gone .  
1	  Broke after 2 months of use . The drive is completely dead now . The extra bulk that everyone complains about didn't bother me too much but this thing doesn't have any warranty . While it worked , it was cool .  
1	  I bought a Linksys 4-port wired router ( Befsr41ver4.1 ) at the beginning of 07 . Setup was a breeze , just plug it in and go literally . The utility disc that was enclosed didn't even work properly . You could get up to the point where it asked you to log in to the router and that was it , it would not take the pre-configured username and password . Warning sign # 1 . After about a year my wife and I were playing FFXI one night and it crashed the connection we couldn't get back on for days . After getting that taken care of the PC would connect through the router but the PS2 would not . I try to get to the router set-up page through my web browser like it tells me to , no luck can't navigate to it at all . Warning # 2 . I call Linksys customer support and find out I need to port forward and to even garner that much info I had to pay for a warrenty extension $ 29.95 out the window . I send repeated E-mails to Square-Enix for the port numbers I need to configure , 16 days later and an all nighter to catch a live tech support rep becaues SE dont answer e-mails obviously . I get my numbers get on the phone with the support from Linksys , give them my case number and find out I have to pay an ADDITIONAL 29.95 , extended warrenty only good for 15 days , they failed to mention that tidbit of important information . 6 hours later with the tech support and I get my router back online and all is right with the world . That was 5 monthes ago as I 'm writing this I am direct connect to my DSL modem that router fouled out again . I still cannot access the set-up page through my browser window . I call linksys and they want another 29.95 or I 'm out of luck , I tell them to shov ^ it . I will not reccomend this thing to anybody even though it lasted a over a year-ish its been nothing but trouble .  
1	  I don't use this Mp3 player for running or anything strenuous that would cause wear and tear . In this case it should last longer than intended to , right ? Wrong . Within a couple of months the play button would not work unless I pushed it at an angle and held down with lots of pressure . It usually took a few tries to get the thing just to turn on . This was annoying , but I lived . Maybe six to eight months later the screen started to freeze up and wouldn't let me change songs or turn itself off . After it played a few songs I could eventually turn it off , but I had to wait five to ten minutes . A year after I received the player something went wrong with the playlist . I don't know if this is a software problem ( Musicmatch worked fine for a year ) or a hardware problem . It won't let me delete of the songs or add any new ones . I 'm stuck with the same three hours of music until I go out and buy a real Mp3 player . I put absolutely no wear and tear on this player except playing Mp3s . I can't imagine how quickly this thing falls apart for people that use it for its purpose : running . Terrible .  
2	  This cover goes on multiple Tamarac bags that support the MAS system , in my case a Cyberpack 8 . The carry case hangs on the side of the pack and the cover makes camera pack virtually waterproof . Although the Cyberpack by itself is very water resistant with the zipper covers pulled tight , in heavier rain , or snow the added protection is nice to have . I highly recommend purchasing this accessory .  
1	  I bought these batteries for my daughter 's swing . They are really of poor quality , they lasted for only a week . I used Duracell batteries in the past , they lasted more than 6 months . I do not recommend anyone to buy these batteries .  
2	  Great price , Used it as a power cable for some USB fans . Worked flawlessly ! Highly recommend this for people who need a decent USB extension .  
1	  The directions are clear and understandable . I work in technology and could not get it to work . After waiting 30 mins for tech support , I was told that it was " probably " defective and to return it . Now , I get to go through the joys of returning something to Amazon .  
1	  Ghosting and static all day , every day . If you need a replacement cable , find one with better shielding .  
1	  Sony is currently the only manufacturer making DVD-RW camcorders and apparently they haven't perfected it . I bought mine for almost $ 1,000 and have had to send it to repair twice , sending it AGAIN as the finalized DVD 's all SKIP ! The DVD 's are also very expensive , only hold 25 minutes of video and although RW 's allow you to re-record you cannot edit out certain clips and record over those . I am truly disappointed to have bought such an expensive defective camera , and what 's worse is the terrible service I have received from Sony . They will not return my money , and will not give me a new camera . Recently I learned from an employee at another store that MANY customers return this model for the same skipping problem . Sony must be aware of this yet continues to con people out of their money . The most they can do for me is issue an " exchange " someone else 's defective camera .. and that 's not guaranteed .. so here we are 4 months later .. with a defective camera having missed out on precious family memories .. going through hassle , time & expense of continuing to have to contact Sony , ship back , test , retest etc . Save yourself the aggravation .. do NOT buy this product .  
1	  I bought this not knowing that it was not for tablet sytle personel dvd players . they have now updated the picture . that is really the only complaint i have . i have sent it back but have not yet received a refund . hopefully i will see that in a few days .  
1	  I bought these to use with my cordless phone and I 'm disappointed by their performance . I can usually hear the other person fine but I am constantly being told that they can't hear me . When I take the headset off and use the same phone however , they can hear me just fine . I wouldn't buy these again .  
2	  Excellent digital camera , superb optical zoom and image stabilization system . Easy operation , has a very clear ( and large ) LCD screen .  
1	  Creative has removed the AC adapter from the included items , and the only place where Amazon mentions it is in the detailed tech info . I feel cheated . I dont know why Creative would do such a thing .. , when all along they were trumpetting the valuse for money vis a vis iPod .  
1	  Be careful when purchasing this cable . I hooked it up and my tv made a horrible noise when I turned it on so I disconnected it . Thank god it didn't damage it  
1	  I purchased this wireless router after much online research and speaking with D-Link Customer Service BEFORE I purchased it online at Amazon . D-Link confirmed that I could add this wireless router downstream to my existing D-Link DLG-4100 router to establish a Wi-Fi network in my house . The DLG-4100 is in my basement where my cable modem is located . After opening the box and trying for an hour unsuccessfully to accomplish this , I called D-Link technical support twice - only to find out eventually that I need a wireless bridge instead ! Right-hand left-hand . And I come to find out that Amazon wants at least 15 % and maybe 20 % to restock because the box is opened . Very , very frustrating . Make sure you know what you really need , however you can , before you buy anything from Amazon and D-Link . P.S. I did some more online research - thank goodness for the Internet - and spoke with one of our IT people at work . It is possible to use this router connected to another router . This connecting or cascading set of routers is described at these two links :[ .. ] The key with the D-Link is to reassign the LAN IP address for the second wireless router to 192.168.0.2 ( leaving the first wired router as 198.168.0.1 ) . Rather than disabling the DHCP Server on the second router ( as the Linksys webpage says to ) , which would eliminate dynamic IP address assignment for the wireless devices connected to the second wireless router ) , instead simply change the local IP range for the two routers to 192.168.0.100 to 192.168.149 for one and the other to 192.168.0.150 to 192.168.0.199 . I am now cooking with gas both for all my wired computers and streaming video Sony Blu-Ray player AND my two laptops ! Thank you Linksys for your AWESOME webpage support and shame on you D-Link for not providing such online or telephone support .  
1	  I have always used the " compatible " printer cartridges simply because of the cost . I make tons of copies and the ink or brand name laser cartridges just cost too much . I have always been very satisfied with the quality of the print of the compatible cartridges until this one . It seems to put a small black line down the left edge of every page . It 's possible that it 's a problem with my printer but it wasn't doing this until I put in the replacement cartridge . Otherwise , the price is great and I 've had no other problems . I 'll go back to using other brands of compatible cartridges when this one runs out . 12/23/10 OK , a couple of months have passed and I am already on the " Low Toner " warning ! I have NEVER chewed through a cartidge this fast so I am added to the list of folks who did not get anywhere near the promised 2500 page yield . THEN , to add insult to injury , I had purchased 2 of these cartidges at the same time so I would have a spare ready and the second one is not recognized . What a pain ! I will find out the manufacturer of the other " compatible " cartridges that I have used in the past . They were fantastic ! These are not . Don't waste your time . these are NOT less expensive .. these are cheap .  
2	  I ordered this as I was going on an outdoors trip with plenty of light ( hiking in SW USA ) so didn't want to take my SB600 but wanted more than the pop-up flash . This unit was super - worked flawlessly , nothing to set or worry about , and easy to pack . Highly recommended .  
2	  As expected , these HDMI cables work just as well as any expensive cable and are ridiculously cheap ! Of course , the Monster Cable product might be slightly more durable and last 35 years , but if something happens to these ( it probably won't ) , you can always just buy another 28 of them for the same price as one Monster Cable !  
1	  This product was complete junk . It doesn't work the way it is supposed to , and when it DOES work , Half the screen was black . Bigger than I expected it to be and completely not worth the money I paid for it .  
1	  I just returned this monitor because of problems that I 've had with it . First , the picture was blurry . I tried changing the resolution but that didn't seem to help . I then tried contacting the Cornea technical support folks . The documentation that came with the monitor gave an email address for technical support . It 's been over a week since I sent the email , and I still haven't heard back from Cornea . The other day was the last straw for me . I had a power outage at my house and the monitor went dead on me . Nothing else at home ( linux server , firewall , laptop , etc . ) had any problems coming back up , so I 'm ruling out any sort of a power spike . I tested the electrical outlet after getting power back to make sure I was getting juice . There was nothing wrong with the outlet , but I wasn't able to get the monitor to power back up . I 've gone back to my old monitor and am much happier with it after the experience I 've had with this Cornea monitor .  
2	  I got the best possible price on one of the best cameras on the market . Everything new , in box with peripherals . No problems .  
2	  Not much more to say , never had a problem with the ink though I seem to go through it rather quickly .  
2	  Works as advertised with 1080p HDMI 1.3 . Can't see any reason to pay premium price for Monster , etc . Worked perfectly on first attempt interconnecting Panasonic THPZ700U 1080p plazma TV , Onkyo TX-SR605 receiver , Panasonic DMP-BD10AK Blue Ray and Motorola DCH3416 ( Comcast ) DVR / cable box .  
2	  Ordered it because it came at a very reasonable price with Panasonic KX-TG7645M , and am glad I did it becuase it works great and make it so convenient to use with the cordless phones .. a great basic headset .  
2	  Just what I needed as a field audio recorder to supplement point-and-shoot HD video . With an old 5G iPod , I can use it as a handheld mic , or take lavalier mic input . Recording also on the in-camera mic as a reference , I later drop the Belkin recording into the Final Cut timeline and match up the waveforms . Delete the camera audio , and go with the better quality from the Belkin and iPod combo . Sound quality is surprisingly good , and the product works as it is advertised .  
2	  Day 1 : Hmm .. in ear ? This was new to me . I put in the ear phones , tried different buds and the verdict .. almost returned them . The base was horrible my head was being filled up with midrange blah . I was comparing these headphones with my Bose headphones and each time the bass was hardly present . I was bummed out . Day 4 : I just couldn't believe that these headphones were so lacking .. I brought in another person to try them out . The response ? " WOW ! These are amazing and the bass is responsive and LOUD . " HUH ? You see .. what I didn't realize was just how important it is to follow the instructions of how to insert these buds into your ear . ' Pull your ear up , place deep into your ear , release your ear AROUND the bud ' . BOTTOM LINE : While the base in my Bose is deeper , its less accurate and lacked the mid and high end accuracy . The sound produced by these headphones is amazingly accurate to what the engineers wanted . As an example .. on this one song from Tool , I had no idea the singer layered his vocals until I used these headhpones . Are they worth the money ? yes . Do they sound great ? Yes . Do they cancel noise ? I can drive down the road with both windows open and I turn the volume up by 1 . CONS : Noise from the cable can be distracting . It doesn't bother me so much but walking around in these you WILL hear it . Bottom line .. These are amazing headphones .  
2	  Good product . The price was right and trhe quality was exceptional . I woiuld definetly buy this again . It was great !  
2	  The Notebook cooler is well designed to cool on either a lap or on a desktop . I had another cooler and it really wasn't designed well if you were actually using the computer on your lap . Here , there are two side vents for air intake ( not directly on the bottom ) so that if your holding your computer the airflow does not get interrupted . It 's also comfortable to hold and works equally well on a desk . The one thing I really dislike about the cooler is the bright blue LED light on the side to tell you that its on . Its just distracting . A small , dim light would serve the same purpose and not be distracting . Overall , however , a good product for the money .  
1	  This TV is a Showcase of horrific flaws in manufacturing and design ! Where to begin .. 1 . The TV has vertical lines on both sides of the set 3-4 inches from edge . 2 . There is also a vertical line that has showed up in the middle of the screen , that is ALWAYS visible and distracting while watching anything . 3 . The HDMI input is CRAP ! I have a PS3 ( more than 1 , and its not the PS3 , it 's the TV that has the problem . ) and I have to physically unplug and re-plug the hdmi cable at least 10 times , at most I 've counted 32 times , just to get it to work . Westinghouse says its a problem with the HDCP , well its a BIG problem . However , they do not seem to think so , seeing how they refuse to fix it . 4 . The Component video inputs are also defective . They have a ghosting / rainbow effect when viewing any source over these inputs . 5 . The remote control is also defective , or I should say the IR receiver on the TV . The remotes signal will only get through 30 % of the time . And you end up having to press the same button 2-3 times , just to get it to change inputs . 6 . Worst for last ! I have addressed all these issues with Westinghouse , and the only way to have SOME of the above mentioned problems fixed is to pay , at my own expense , for the shipping of this TV across country . Which would cost me literally half of what I payed for the actual TV . It should also be mentioned that I have used only HIGH quality cables , Monster Cable 1000 Series , HDMI and Component . I also have been a Manager at Radioshack for years and have a lot of knowledge in the area of Home Theater . This TV has let me learn a wonderful lesson . NEVER CHEAP out on a TV . Save ! to buy one of good quality , or don't buy one at all !  
1	  The dock worked OK with my Denon 2808 for about 1 month and then just stopped working at all . The receiver can not communicate with the dock and does not get the signal from the iPod . Piece of junk .  
2	  Polk audio is excellent sound for price . I have smaller Klipsch speakers that produce better sound , in my opinion . They are too expensive to justify for all of the speakers in my house , though :) Can't speak much to the highs and lows . My center channel 's got amazing highs , and my sub takes care of the lows . These complete the surround , and I have no issues with what they produce .  
2	  It sounds great , charges your Ipod , portable . The only thing I don't like about it is that its hard to scroll through the menus on your ipod because it 's mounted low on the system .  
2	  I got these to replace my 4 yr old Senn px 100 which suddenly got broken at the miniplug , these are not as comfortable as the Px 100 but they do sound great and give you more bass because they are tighter against your ears but with an offer from another site which ended costing me just $ 5.00 i could not pass them up . They 're also very sensitive which makes them ideal for Ipods and other portable devices .  
2	  After years of contorting myself to listen to audiobooks to put myself to sleep , while keeping the volume low enough not to wake the wife , I 'm thrilled to say that this thing works beautifully . Sound quality is good and it 's proven durable . Still working perfectly after more than a year of being used every night and a fair amount of travel . I prefer to sleep on thin pillows and occasionally will need to shift an ear off of a speaker , but it 's a very minor issue and I 'd absolutely buy it again .  
1	  used to use my canon 18-55 to shoot indoors & for wide angle shots but I needed to replace it quite quickly just before christmas - I didn't want to spend too much for a lens just to take some pics over christmas holiday so I got this - I was expecting that it wouldn't be the same as my canon lens but gosh , I 've only been frustrated by this lens - even when lighting is light enough to get it to focus , the focus is NOT good - but that 's only when it will focus because I have been having a heck-uva-time trying to get it to focus on my kids unless their whole face is aiming directly at me AND there is enough light on the facial features for the lens to find something to focus on - low light focusing , forget it . focusing with flash - forget it also . can't wait to buy another canon 18-55 - argh !  
1	  I purchased this tele converter lens as an add on to my Canon PowerShot S60 . Boy was I disappointed . Let me first say that you first have to purchase an adapter to use this lens with my model ( S60 ) . Not a big deal since the adapter wasn't too expensive . The bad news is that the lens and adapter do not feel secure . As far as performance .. the lens does what is says ( brings in the shot 2X ) . However the images taken with the lens are terrible . The lens feels bulky and leaves a dark spot in the lower right hand corner of all images taken with the lens on . Do not purchase this lens . Stick with the built in digital zoom instead and don't waste your money .  
1	  The Griffin TuneJuice 2 Battery Backup for iPod is deemed by most reviewers as pretty lame as a battery extender and charger . But there is an alternative , and it is quite good in terms of performance and value . It is called Music Power 0900-72 Encore Dual Port USB AC Charger with Rechargeable Extended Battery . It is not a one-piece design like the Kensington Mini Battery Extender and Charger , but because of that , it is more flexible ( It 's a general purpose portable / AC 2-port USB charger ) and will allow me to continue my Skype session without interruption . In other words , I can CHARGE my iPod Touch and USE my headphone / microphone at the same time . Not only that , there is no issue with having to remove iPod Touch 's protective case if you have one , or having to maintain a certain angled contact between the battery and the iPod for positive charging to take place . For me , this is a much better and more practical solution to extending the use of my iPod Touch . And it is also cheaper than the Kensington , plus you will most likely be able to use this battery on future versions of iPod and things that rely on USB power . I highly recommend it ( Music Power 0900-72 Encore ) .  
2	  This is like 6th router i have owned , and i love it . other than my dir-855 , this is the best one . the speed is great and so is the signal . Very easy setup if you are experinced with routers .. if not , great time to learn . one complaint is that it 's not 108G but most routers aren't so oh well . overall great router for the price .  
1	  Absolutely terrible tech support , comes with zero usuable maps , took me 6 hours and 4 attempts with tech support to download maps . May have been my computer Microsoft Vista , but still 6 hours .  
2	  Just a short blurb on how impressed I was by this lense 's IS feature . I have IS on the 3 other Canon lenses I have . All state they should eleminate up to 3 stops . This lense is obvious that it works to that level . I put the movie mode on my T2i and you can really see the amount of shake the IS takes out of the image . Very impressive . Only negative I can give this lense is that the IS mechanism was audible . You really notice when it 's working with a slight hum from the lense . You don't hear it out and about , but in a quite room it took me a while to figure out where that new noise was coming from . Auto focus usually makes noise , but this is the only lense I 've used that hummed while the IS was working .  
2	  Simply put , this camera is a SOLID machine that offers excellent image quality as well as photographic control . Being an SLR , I never used the LCD screen to shoot , which makes it more like using a standard 35mm . Get the battery pack / grip . Without it , the consumption of batteries is tremendous . With it , I easily got 1000 shots before needing a recharge . My major gripe , and the reason I upgraded to a Canon EOS D60 , is that it is SLOW . The buffer is inadequate and I always found myself waiting for it to empty to take another shot . Viewing the images on the LCD screen takes forever . And the top shutter speed of 1/650 second is not fast enough .  
1	  I am so sick of trying to buy a GPS system . I just wanted a GPS like the one in a rental car I had recently , instead I have to compare 30 different systems ( and that 's just Garmin 's " on the road " Automotive category ) across 50 different " features " not including price . I 'm exhausted with the whole process so I settle on this model and now I find out it doesn't have " street name " voices . I 'm always going to remember this experience as distinctly unenjoyable .  
2	  I recently purchased this wonderful reader about a couple of months ago . I opened the box and plugged it in . I didn't realize how easy it is to use . You push the button on top and a window pops up , then you select transfer images and select a folder then you are pretty much done . It 's that simple ! I was amazed by this product and I payed $ 19.99 at Best Buy for it . I RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE .  
2	  I bought this unit for my son so he could use the music on his I-phone in his car . So far the unit seems to work flawlessly !  
1	  I got 3 loose rolls of film , not as pictured in orginal Fuji wrapping . Without original wrapping I cannot tell the film 's experation date .  
1	  We purchased this camera and had to return it because the shutter delay is excruciating . I filled an entire memory card with pictures of my boys and didn't get one good shot . In some frames there was no subject because my toddler was 6 feet away before the shutter finally clicked ( 3 to 4 seconds after the hitting the button ) . The LED screen on the back was also faulty giving a red cast to the scene at hand - not like my previous Olympus digital . I can't recommend another model as we are still looking for that perfect choice .  
1	  The Garmin company is awful . If you buy from them , you will most likely have to deal with their Customer Sevice Dept . Good luck ! They act like they are too big to worry about a consumer . They sell out-dated maps ( over 1 1/2 years old ) in their units , and expect the customer to spend $ 70 more to update the map in a brand new unit ! What good is a GPS that doesn't know some of the roads exist ? The customer service department says , " oh well most people are ok with old maps " . I will not own a Garmin , I would rather be lost !  
1	  I know you can't get something for nothing - and I guess I forgot that when I ordered the Tamron 18-200 for my Nikon D70 . It seems like a great idea - but one must remember that a super zoom must make many trade-offs . My first bad experience was trying to put two Tiffen filters on . At 18mm it created a black shadow on the sensor . I then started noticing the lack of sharpness and distortion compared to the stock Nikon 18-70 lens . For most of my shots , it probably is OK . But when one counts - I don't think it will deliver .  
2	  I have a lot of burnable CDs that I use for both work and driving in the car - these , combined with the silver paint sharpies , make it easy to burn a CD and jot down whatever 's on it . The black CDs almost require the silver paint sharpies , but any other CD works just fine with the standard black sharpie colors . I 've never had a dead CD with these and the coloration also makes the " see-through " CD a thing of the past . Worth the extra for the upgrade .  
1	  This worked the day I received it , but now 2 months later when T-storm season has started and I actually need it , it doesn't work at all ! It 's hard to imagine that a power surge got it since it has been sitting unplugged on a shelf . Terrible .  
2	  I think product is very easy to use . For some one that does not howto use the computer well should have no problem down loading picturesonce you get familiar with it  
1	  I wish i had the product to review .. Its been a breaking month and i have yet to see my charger come in .  
2	  I buy lots of batteries throughout the year and these Sony Stamina Platinum AA are just terrific . Even though they came in a box with many of them loose from their original packaging , they all have done the job . Would buy more in a heartbeat .  
2	  When you buy a Sony , you are buying quality . This is my second Sony TV set . I have been viewing the TV with rooftop antenna for almost six weeks now and I 'm still in awe at the picture quality . My next purchase will be a Sony DVD HD recorder to compliment my new HD TV . I can not omit mentioning J & R music and Computers ( this is my second purchase with them ) for their efficient and quick service .  
1	  Waste of money since you can't send it back once you have openned it . It is clearly labeled to fit " all " in those manufactured years . It does not and I was required to buy the correct kit from a retail store and eat the price of the kit from amazon . Lesson learned - buy local .  
2	  Really good video . The installation was easy , but the settings took me a long to do it right . The only reason I gave 4 is because the manual , which you have to download from the Internet , is a little confusing . You really have do dig in to find how to make the video do what you want . I still have to read more in order to understand more about the video board . However , I am really satisfied with the performance of the board . Maya runs smoth and clean . The great news is that it works on Linux too . Great product .  
1	  One star because there is no Black Hole rating . This keyboard KILLED my PC . After installing the supplied driver I got a BSOD that told me my PC could not be booted . I did not notice until afterwards that the driver CD said WINDOWS 98 - after all this keyboard is for people with poor eyesight ! The BSOD kindly informed me that if I had installed any new hardware and drivers to please uninstall them which I couldn't , natch , because I could not get past the Blue Screen of Death . I hate sarcastic error messages . Tried Last Good Config , Safe Mode , everything I could think of . Could not boot , period . I hadn't backed up my data for a week and lost a lot of time consuming Photoshop work . Thank goodness for external hard drives as at least I had most of my work saved . Still , it took me nearly 36 hours straight to get my spare PC configured and set up . Now I have to buy a new Spare PC . What a nightmare .  
1	  I 've gone through 3 WRE54G range expanders and they have all died . The last 2 died in less than 3 months ! I 'll never purchase another Linksys product .  
1	  I noticed that a bunch of people recently had issues with their Sennheiser 's quality , but I hoped I those were the exceptions . I guess not . My headset arrived factory sealed ( and on time ) , but after close to an hour of fiddling with it I determined that yep , the mic was broken . You can hear a buzz when it 's on , and that buzz disappears when you click the mute switch . And sometimes you can barely make out your voice coming through . Barely . I tried my wife 's El Cheapo headset and that worked fine in the same jacks , so yes , the Sennheisers were bad . Judging from the timeline of good vs . bad reviews , it seems the bad reviews are also the more recent ones . Whatever the reason , I 'd shy away from these .  
2	  It 's nothing flashy , but it protects my hard drive and has quality construction . The elastic strap is nice to hold the hard drive in place and the pocket for the cable is great . This was a good buy .  
2	  I have a Canon Elura 100 camcorder and an Olympus Camedia C-3040 digital camera and this case holds them both , plus the assessories needed when traveling - extra batteries , tapes , memory cards , connection cords and such , all in a case about the size of the lunchbox I carried as a kid .  
1	  If you have a factory original car stereo without a casette deck it will be a lot of work to use the new Starmates . The built-in FM wireless transmitter that allows the Starmate to broadcast on an unused radio frequency is far too weak for use in the car - the static on the unused channel will be intermixed with the Sirius programming . Instead , you must connect a cable to the Starmate 's headphone jack and splice it with the car stereo 's antenna or auxiliary input . In June 2006 the FCC determined that the original Starmate generated far too powerful a signal and ordered it toned down . As a Sirius customer since January 2006 , I 've owned both versions of the Starmate , and the old version is deserving of the rave reviews it has received - I never once experienced any problems with static . However , the old version I had broke and once I replaced it with the new one , static dominated my Sirius programming .  
2	  I just received my DX3900 four days ago and so far I 'm pleased . It is my second digital camera . My first , a Canon Power Shot A50 is still very good and is only 1.3MP . The Kodak is very easy to use and has a few more features than the older Canon . The price [ I paid was ] less than [ what ] I paid for the 1.3MP Canon two years ago and better than most new 2MP cameras . I compared lots of cameras before I bought this one . I really wanted an Olympus , Canon , Nikon or Fuji but kept coming back to this one . I bought it mainly for the higher pixel count and especially the price . It doesn't have the features of the others but again , the price was just too good to pass . I really like the optional lenses that can be purchased and I plan to get them ASAP . I 'm going to try it on one of my telescopes and hope to capture some good astro-images . I purchased the 128MB card which is a must for this camera because the 8MB card that comes with it holds a miniscule 8 pictures . I will say that it doesn't feel quite as good as the Canon which has a heavier metallic body . The Kodak is plastic but again most of the others I have held lately are also plastic . Also , the display at 1.5 " is a bit smaller than the Canon 's 2 " display . I also find my Canon 's card slot and ejection mechanism to be higher quality and I do fear that I 'll break the door on the Kodak .. but again the price .  
2	  Used this remote keyboard for 4 days . It 's attractive , well designed and easy to use . An earlier reviewer described the mouse pointer as being awful and it is - BUT ONLY WHEN THE UNIT IS BRAND NEW . Initially the mouse pointer is difficult to use by way of the amount of finger pressure required to get it to operate . During the first few days of operation , it was difficult to place the cursor exactly where I wanted it because of the amount of pressure required . HOWEVER AFTER 3 DAYS OF USAGE THE POINTER HAS BROKEN IN AND NOW WORKS JUST AS GOOD AS A TOUCH STICK ON A QUALITY LAPTOP . I can now recommend this keyboard remote to anyone seeking the convenience of wanting a wireless keyboard / remote without having to manipulate 2 separate units . It 's easy to use from your own lap , table or computer drawer . JUST REMEMBER WHAT I MENTIONED EARLIER - WHEN YOU FIRST USE A NEW UNIT YOU WILL ACTUALLY HATE IT BECAUSE OF THE INITIAL STIFFNESS AND STUBBORN MOVEMENT OF THE POINTER , but give it a few days and hardly any pressure is required from your finger .  
2	  After looking at and using MANY brands of equipment case for photography , sound and video equipment I finally discovered Vanguard Diamond ABS cases-and will never go back to another brand again . These are indestructible , lightweight , lockable , very classy looking and most important of all about half the price of comparable cases from other name-brand manufacturers . I 've used them now for over a year of intensive use in my high school video and photography classes and they still look brand new . Trust me , other cases costing twice as much did not survive ! This particular case is the perfect size for a large digital still camera ( such as the Canon Digital Rebel ) and an accessory lens or two . I also use this size for my Sony PDX-10 video cameras and the case is deep enough to keep the mic attached all the time , saving setup time as well as wear and tear . The case is just barely big enough for that , which is perfect for me but if you want accessories in the case with a video camera I 'd reccomend the next size up instead . The pick-n-pluck foam makes it easy to customize the case to fit your equipment . No complaints , and highly recommended . ( Okay , one complaint . Annoyingly , amazon doesn't seem to tell you the dimensions of the various Vanguard cases , nor sometimes even the model number so you 're left guessing which case you 're ordering . Hopefully this will be fixed soon , right amazon ? ! )  
2	  As a vigilant user of headphones I was hesitant of using buds , so I did my research and found these bad boys . I wanted bass and that is exactly what I got , in spades . I will admit that there is slight learning curve of how to properly put these buds in your ears , but that can be fixed by reading the manual . The only trouble I had with the headphones was getting the right fit , which is essential . I found out that one has the put the buds in their ear and then gently rock them back and forth until they stay put ad you get the true bass experience . These buds also deter aby sound from getting into your ear . I have used these on a bus , sitting next to the heater and still heard nothing . The price also was a factor , if you buy these from Amazon and look for the other sellers , you 'll find there are some sold for as little as $ 178.88 , which a lot better than the usually $ 200.00 . My overall unqualified reccomendation is buy these because they will not let you down and are of high quality .  
1	  I have had this MP3 for awhile . It is not very easy to move around in and the buttons are not very well laid out . Holds a good amount of CD 's . The provided headphones are not very good . I switched to the iPod and have never looked back .  
1	  This is very small . When you squeeze it , air doesn't come through the brush . It looks like there aren't any one way valves in this . So you have to squeeze with one finger covering the hole in the middle of the blower to prevent air escaping through it rather than through the brush . ( Maybe this is how it was intended to be used but the blower brushes I have used previously had one way valves . ) Even when you get the air through the brush , it is a very small amount so quite useless as a blower .  
2	  After looking at the features of the ipod vs the " non-pods " , I bought this Creative Zen Vision M 60gb MP4 player . I like the slightly thinner iPod , but it really is very insignificant when compared with the Vision M 's features . You probably already know the Vision M allows copying of Tivo recordings through Tivo Desktop and . avi ( DVDs ) through ripping software . I have Lost , Desperate Housewives , CSI , and Bones automatically updated each week on my Vision M when I dock my unit . Sometimes I like listening to books when I commute , so now I can download them through my local library for free . The library uses Overdrive and NetLibrary to check them out to me for 3 weeks , and guess what ? No late fees , they just disappear from my list on the due date the library gave me . Owners of Ipods have to buy their audiobooks from Apple because Apple refuses to allow Overdrive or NetLibrary to use their iPod format for providing downloads . So , nothing for free for your iPod . This was a big factor for me because this proprietary attitude is what caused Apple to lose marketshare in the 80s and move from a frontrunner to last place in the PC market . Anyway , I recorded a meeting at work that took over 30 minutes using the built-in microphone and it caught everyone 's voice just fine . I wish I had this years ago in school . I use to carry a 1GB flash drive with me , but since I partitioned 4GB of the Vision M , I don't need it . I have about 8 movies , 20 short video clips , 600 songs , 15 word files from school and work , over 100 photos of friends & family , and I still have 30gb left to fill up . I go on walks and have a wide range of choices now : listen to FM stereo , MP3s , audiobooks , a movie , or a TV show . What can the Vision M not do is the question ! I accessorized the heck out of this . I highly recommend buying the retractable cable set with adapters . It plugs into a USB , household power , or the car accessory plug with included adapters . Creative I-trigue 200 speakers are perfect for blasting sounds at home . Kroo puts out a nice black leather case that protects the unit from scratches , has a belt hook , and a kick stand so the player can stand up on its own , which is great for watching movies . I also highly recommend the Creative video cable . My VisionM hooked up to my 36 " TV in seconds . The picture from the movie played just like having my original DVD . I have a 7.1 megapizel camera and my photos from that are on my Vision M , so when we put them on the TV , what detail ! Case Logic puts out a nice case that holds the unit and all attachments securely . My Vision M is about two months old now , but I 'm so happy with it and I am still discovering the amazing features of this unit . The only drawback is that I cannot find a decent cassette adapter ( tried Sony and Coby ) or FM transmitter ( tried one that cost $ 80 from Target ) for playing MP3s through the car 's system . Perhaps its time for a new car stereo with a built in MP3 jack .  
2	  i just bought one to day and it shakes my room my parents LIKE THAT and it is not 300W it is 360Watts and i have a boies and i got this and i gave my dad the boies well i like it thank you .  
2	  Excellent product , cost less than a couple dollars and in the major stores they were asking $ 40.00 for the equivalent . I am extremity satisfy .  
2	  I 'm usually very sketchy about buying 3rd party lenses , but this lens was an exception . After using this lens under low light conditions , I have to admit that this lens is VERY sharp in the center while the corners tend to be soft . I found some user opinions complaining about images not being sharp enough at wide open apertures . My other sharp primes ( 50mm f / 1.8 and 85mm f / 1.8 ) get softer and softer around the edges as the aperture is bigger and bigger . Same goes for this lens . In normal light conditions , this lens is as sharp as some of my best prime lenses . In low light conditions , I found image results to be sharp at f / 1.8 and beyond . Definitely a fast lens . The autofocus is a little funny , but overall , I find it very difficult to take this prime lens off my D80 . I highly recommend it !  
2	  Luckily , I haven't experienced any of the issues with failure that other reviewers have noted . I 've shot with this card on numerous occasions and taken probably a few thousand photos with out issue so far . I 've used this card with multiple Nikon and Canon DSLRs . Losing work / images is never fun . I 'd suggest that anyone that has had issues with failure try and see if Transcend will offer them a replacement .  
1	  I purchased this and theMelnor 3015 6-Cycle Electronic AquaTimer Digital Hose Timer . Both of them worked great for a few months . The two zone control is just what I needed . Unfortunately , both units stopped completely turning off when they were scheduled to . Water would leak out into the hose , which is great for my plants , but not for my water bill .  
1	  Tons of static and I have a direct line running from this into my car stereo ( NOT FM TUNER ) . It charges fine and cuts off ipod when I turn off engine but the amount of static makes it unusable . I would have been better off with just a cheap charger for the car .  
2	  I bought a set for each of my children ; 2y and 5y . They are the perfect size for their little heads ; they dont ' slide off like other headsets do . They can both put them on without assistance , and they love wearing them . I love them because now I can listen to my XM in the car and not have the DVD competing behind me !  
1	  I got this Radio / MP3 Media Player in January 2009 . After I received it , I filled the 2 GB of space with music . Not long thereafter I noticed that the media player would reset or lock every time it started playing some songs ( I suspect WMA files ) . After that , I stopped using the MP3 Player feature alltogether and only used it 's radio and voice recording features . You can also download pictures into it , albeit using a special software which converts the files to a smaller size which can be viewed on the player 's screen . Getting the software to work was very tricky , because you have to know which option to select after you plug the player to your PC . The battery stopped working ( after being fully charged it discharged completely after 2 minutes ) in 2 and a half years . All in all , I 'm not too dissatisfied with this product due to its very low price . I would still be satisfied if the battery wouldn't have died on me .  
2	  Works well ; replacement ink is cheap if you buy non-factory . Cheap to buy . No frills and easy to use . Does the job .  
1	  these speakers are not for people who like loud music or plan on hearing their speakers over their subs . had these in for about 3 days , i hated them from day on because they crackled too much when the music is cranked all the way up but now they 're blown and all they do is fart  
1	  I had bad luck with this product . I found the setup process easy enough , but the box was not very reliable . Ever few days it would lock-up for some unknown reason . I had to power cycle the box to make it work again . I 've now replaced it with an equivalent Linksys 802.11g router box which has been problem-free .  
2	  I already owned the higher-end F6C1500-TW-RK ( 1,500VA ) and knew it and the software to be very reliable , so the decision to buy the 750VA model was easy for me . It 's great , works as advertised and is very affordable . However , the software is not the same as on my higher end unit and I was bummed that I didn't get the same gauges and controls for quick visual confirmation . Still , for less than $ 85 , it 's the right choice for a simple non-critical desktop UPS .  
1	  Product is five star . When it breaks prepare yourself to hold online for hours or leave a message that won't be returned . If a small part breaks you need to buy a whole new kit . Audiovox sucks .  
2	  OK , you just spent $ 500 + on your new shiny toy - iPad ( 2 ) .. and you 're still thinking about an extra $ 13 ? ! Well , DON'T ! C'mon ! Just get it , you cheapskates ! You need it , you really do . I think , all iPads must come with it ( by default ) , seriously ! Light , adjustable to ANY desirable viewing angle you may need , with or without covers . Hats off to Arkon - good job , guys ! Good job !  
1	  I bought the Khypermedia CD-R 50 pack , the cd space was mentioned 700MB but my drive ( khypermedia drive ) always complains about its size if the data & gt ; 640MB.I tried to call Khpermedia service center but the phone was never picked up . I left 3 voice mails no response after 4 months . Later on I tried to call merchant and complain about its size they said we will take it back if it is not opened and used which is not possible . At last I end up with paying more for less space . Amazon beware of this product .  
2	  I love this machine and haven't had any problem with it ( I purchased it about 6 months ago ) . The sound and the design are great too ! I use it regularly and everything works perfect on it . The only thing I didn't like was that when I program the radio stations and afterwords it gets removed and pluged in somewhere else the stations are gone . I can start it all over again but I think this is normal . This is how it works with every radio .  
1	  I ordered this product to charge my iPod shuffle and it did not work . I left a review and was sent a new one , which also did not work . I don't know if I just got 2 duds , or if none of the products work period .  
2	  I 've had this player for a few months now . Overall , I am pleased with it . The software has a few bugs in it but , you figure them out pretty quickly and figure out how to work around them . The player itself has only one problem I 've found . Sometimes if you 're playing a song and decide to switch to another song from your library it won't play it . You just have to press play one more time and it will work . Really not a big deal at all . Also , it transfers songs very quickly . It is definately bigger than an ipod but , the price isn't . I figure it is still very small compared to the books of 600 CD 's I used to carry around . It is definately a good buy any way you look at it .  
1	  I rarely cry ' wolf ' but .. I ordered this product , it came in without the part that holds the MP3 .. so it is useless ( they shipped the 809-TS ) . I called Customer Service who overnighted another complete package although I advised it was just missing the one part ( it was the only way they could do it ) . Just got the replacement - same thing .. The window mount itself is heavy duty - it will be nice if they can get me the rest of the unit .. or determine it wasn't supposed to come with that part ? Then they need to also fix the description and the image .  
2	  I love it ! Would definitely recommend it to someone looking to buy a good navi system . It has bluetooth capabilities , as well as e-mail and lots of other cool features . Makes a great gift .  
2	  If you are looking for a great quality card at an afordable price then this is the one for you . I was hesitant about buying a Transcend since I am a San Disk and Kingston customer but I figured I would give it a try based on the great reviews . Well , I just added anonther 5 star rating to this card . While not everyone needs an 8gb card ( a 4gb card is usually more than enough ) if you want the extra memory then this is the one to get . Great performance at a great price .  
2	  The product was excellent and the whole experience was great . I knew what the product was like since I had one already . Great product as well .  
2	  I bought this tripod for a photography class I 'm taking . Turns out the tripod is a prosumer product used by both advanced photographers and intermediate . It appears to be constructed well and supports my digital camera just fine . I got a great deal purchasing from Amazon and would recommend this tripod to anyone looking for a solid set of legs and support for their camera at a great price .  
1	  I bought one of these from Tech Geek . This cam does not have infrared capabilities . The 6 LEDs are actually blindingly bright white lights . When I finally got a response from Kinamax , they say thet the cam will work in the dark . Well , so will my other one if I hook a flashlight to it . Ok cam for the money , but working in the dark and infrared are two different things . Drivers can be found at kinamax dot com  
1	  I have 2 digital cameras , a new Kodak Z612 and a Casio EXILIM about a year old . Neither camera recognizes this card . I tried formatting it and the cameras still do not recognize the card . The 3D website does not even show the card . Tiger Direct will not accept it as a return . 2 lessons : don't buy this card and don't buy anything Amazon sells of Tiger Direct .  
1	  This Wireless bridge completely sucked . The firmware was buggy never saved my information . It said it supported WPA which it did not have any fields for it . If i did get it to connect to my access point it would immediately disconnect . D-Link had always cool looking devices . This was a square plastic cheap box with a giant D on the front of it and a big annoying light on the front . This product could use a lot of redesign . Specially the firmware . I would not recommend for a wireless bridge .  
2	  This mouse is great . I love the side scrolling abilities and the two thumb buttons . Everything is put together in a way that always works , I 've never had any trouble with the mouse . It is stylish and fits perfectly in my hand . The laser quality is outstanding , a leap above normal optical . I have the wireless version of this at my house , and it is less reliable . Both because the wireless seems to cause trouble and because it has a few extra buttons that I can't seem to get to work . However this wired one is flawless .  
1	  I was thrilled at first , as the size was right and the sound was good . I left my Nano 3 generation ( yes in the correct insert ) on it for about an hour . When I removed my ipod it was frozen . I went to itunes and restored the original settings-still frozen . I think this thing has killed my 5 month old ipod . I am just disgusted . Read all the reviews before I made my purchase , and thought this would be perfect for travel . Now I have to purchase a new ipod . BE AWARE OF THIS POSSIBILITY !  
2	  This camera is amazing . It , however , as all digital SLRs have , has a steep learning curve . If you just want to take pictures of the family , you won't be impressed . However if you are interested in other realms of photography , such as macro , nature , landscape , artistic , this is the perfect camera .  
2	  great for all three kids aged 3 , 4 , and 6 for their leapster explorer , innotab , dsi , laptops and mp3 players . my home is much quieter and less confusing now . tried other types of headphones and earbuds that where uncomfortable and flimsy and always taken off within a few minutes . only con is my 3 year old gets the long wire tangled with her connected stylus pen on her leapster explorer but other that that , first rate product . very similar to the local schools headphones in the schools computer labs for the little ones .  
1	  While this is a good looking product it has a fatal design flaw . The edge of the light has a piece of plastic that is visible from the side . The problem is that even when the light is pointed down at the keyboard you 'll see the bright edge of the light and no matter how you position it the glare is bliding in low light situations ( which is the only time you need the damned thing ) . A piece of electric tape will solve the problem but I 'd suggest you look at another model .  
1	  I loved the size of this unit . I don't understand why so many other manufacturers have such big boxes . First six months it was fine , I had it set at 480P feeding a Samsung HLP 6361 and the picture was fine ( I 'm on the list to get a Samsung 941 as I want the 720P upconvert HDMI ) . Anyways , this thing doesn't read disks anymore , period . It started to freeze a few months ago and then just stopped working . Save your money  
1	  it does not fit in my old toshiba laptop or my current hp pavilion dv6  
1	  So far as I can tell , there is no problem with the camera case , but it is too big for the PowerShot S100 , and not big enough to hold the camera and charger . I 'm returning one I recieved as a gift - this could be the perfect case for another camera .  
1	  I bought this for my 7 year old daughter who has been asking for a digital camera for awhile and was sorely disappointed . The camera is made of a cheap plastic and there is no review screen to see the pictures . It only holds a few pictures at a time and changing the default settings on the camera is the biggest pain . She did enjoy making the online journal with her own pictures , but frankly , it wasn't anything we couldn't do in word , and she was NOT impressed by the selections for the backgrounds or cards . Plus , due to the small amount of pictures the camera could hold , I was constantly uploading pictures and then deleting the camera so she could go take more .  
1	  bought it , returned it , bought a Logitech Harmony remote . If you like touchscreens I suppose this is for you , my wife hated it , refused to use it . With a touchscreen you can't feel your way to a button , you have to be accurate and deliberate . Also doesn't make up well with Tivo , which is a big deal in my household . Pros : Cheap , not bad pc softwareCons : doesn't match up well with Tivo , I use my recv'r for sound this doesn't let the recv'r volume pass thru to other device menus like other universal remotes , bad ergonomics ( not the best remote for one-hand use ) , actions didn't always work ( ex . sometimes All-off would turn everything off , other times it wouldn't turn the tv off , even though it was aimed correctly )  
2	  Not getting to easy to find 2 gig cards in stores , hope they will continue to be available for a while longer online .  
1	  These are NOT crimp type pins . They are flag type and must be soldered if you wish a strong connection . The photo is deceptive as it is not clear enough to tell they are not crimp type .  
2	  Currently I 'm moving some family memories from older VHS tapes to DVD-Ram and ripping them to a digital format on my PC . Since these are important memories , I want to have as many backups as possible so rerecording them back onto ' fresh ' VHS tapes is something important to me . Comparing these tapes to local price , the price here on Amazon is very competitive . After recording older footage onto these VHS tapes , I 'm quite satisfied with the quality of these tapes on the SP record setting . Not much has changed in the VHS tape since it has become such a dinosaur , but it 's great to be able to get this product when you need it , for a reasonable price .  
1	  it doesn't mention it is a minidisc lens cleaner ! i bought it then found out it was a minidisc one ! otherwise it might be good if you are looking for a mini disc lens cleaner listen to the other reviews but if you want a regular cd lens cleaner buy a different one !  
2	  I have a feeling that if A. Rodriguez had to replace his camera after almost 2 months , it probably means that there was something with HIS camera not the actual model . I have this camera and it works perfectly fine and I have no complaints . When the flash loads , it takes at the most 5 seconds to do so ( and just when you take the first picture after turning on your camera , not at any other time ) and when taking a picture , it takes 2 seconds do so at the regular setting . Just tonight I had a " problem " with this camera and I went to HP 's support and troubleshooting at ww . hp . com and they , true to their word , replied in an hour and helped solve the " problem " which turned out to not be a problem at all . He told me how to fix it by changing the ISO Speed , White Balance , and EV Compensation and everything was how it was supposed to be . I definently recommend this camera .  
2	  This product will forever change the way you watch TV . Suddenly , you are in complete control of what you watch and when . I don't watch less TV , but I do watch the TV that I want to watch . I wouldn't recommend this for someone who isn't somewhat comfortable with technology . And yes , it does crash at times , but the benefits far outweigh the inconvenience . Purchase at least 80 hours of storage time if you plan to record on medium quality which I recommend . The commercial skip feature is great . Ok .. it isn't perfect , but it is by far the best available . This feature will be GOING AWAY with the introduction of the 5500 series due to pressure from the entertainment industry . Take a look at the article below . - ReplayTV has agreed to remove two features from its product that infuriated the ad and broadcasting industries even more than they delighted consumers . ReplayTV 's new 5500 model , on sale next month , has been re-engineered so that it cannot automatically skip entire commercial breaks without recording them . Nor will it be able to send recorded programming over the internet to other ReplayTV users outside a home network . But the devices will still indefinitely store many hours of programming , while enabling users to skip manually in 30-second segments through recorded commercials . Two years ago , a consortium of movie and TV studios sued Sonicblue & # 65533 ; the former owner of ReplayTV and now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection & # 65533 ; for abetting copyright infringement with the device & # 65533 ; s commercial-skipping feature . The company and its technology was subsequently acquired by D & M ; Holdings of Japan . D & M ; executives insist that the dropping of these features was voluntary , although critics see the move as capitulation rather than an accommodation . Jim Hollingsworth , president of D & M ; & # 65533 ; s ReplayTV division , denies this . & # 65533 ; We did this on our own . There was no coercion . We will take features out because we want to be a positive force in the industry . & # 65533 ; But Jeff Joseph , vp and spokesman for the Consumer Electronics Association , is not convinced : & # 65533 ; Companies are under considerable pressure to bow to the wishes of the entertainment industry . This is unfair and anticompetitive . If advertisers and broadcasters are seeing their traditional business model threatened , then it would behoove them to consider alternative business models . & # 65533 ;  
2	  Item is the same as buying locally yet it is only a fraction of the cost . Very happy with the fast service .  
2	  Good Quality heavy duty Door lock motor . Came with All parts required to install , including cable to run to the alarm .  
1	  I didn't realize that I couldn't charge both my iPhones . One port is for the iPhone and the other port is for an iPod normal , not an iTouch . So , unfortunately this isn't going to help my situation of charging at the same time . I wish the description had warned me .  
2	  This web cam is so awesome ! It is very clear and streams extremely well . I received it promptly even in the bad weather !  
1	  It did not work at all . this is worse purchase I have eversi & oacute ; n done . WhenIt arrive the box was not even damage . Then I conected to the usb and nothing happened , not one letter work  
2	  After much research , I decided to to purchase an OEM ( original equipment manufacturer ) replacement lamp for my Panasonic PT-AX200U projector . The original lamp had about 2300 hours and was still going strong and looked great , but was losing some brightness and sharpness and had a slight softness that only I noticed . I use the projector almost every day to watch TV and movies . I decided to stay away from lamps advertised as " 100 % compatible " or an " OEM equivalent . " Sure , these lamps will cost less , but too many people have had problems such as shortened lamp life and decreased brightness right out of the box . I have about 350 hours on the new lamp and glad I purchased an original ET-LAX100 . The old lamp with 2300 hours will be used as a backup and I hope to get another 2300 hours or more from this lamp .  
2	  You can probably find this camera at a very low price . The picture quality is quite good , and once you get used to it , its fairly easy to use and gives good results . Be aware that , when using flash , this camera uses up AA batteries very quickly . I 'd estimate you can get 20 + flash pictures before you 'll need to replace the batteries . You 'll get better battery life when taking pictures in sunlight , without flash . The camera does support a DC power supply , but finding a DC power supply that matches the specs listed in the manual may be difficult . I finally located one at a specialty camera store . Finally the manual , Samsung web site , and Samsung customer support leave MUCH to be desired .  
1	  I bought this lens and wish now I had not . I was looking for a real macro lens and with a focal point in macro of 37.4 it does not produce the photos I want . I saw no difference in the normal photos and ones with the macro switched on . It is alright as a general lens but don't expect the clairity and quality that you would get with higher end lenses . I 'd rate this ho-hum .  
1	  and I 'm waiting .. and waiting .. and waiting .. and waitingI 'd write a review if I had the damn unit . Right now , its gotta be one star , since I can only imagine ( based on other reviews ) how nice this puppy is . Latest shipment estimate is end of Feburary . 2 1/2 months delivery time ? It could be time to begin to look elsewhere for one of these bad boys .  
1	  this is the 2nd one i have owned . both have been defective . i only used this item 1 time . the 2nd time the screen was black . very unhappy !  
1	  I have never seen anything as bad as this . I have a BEFW11S4 router and a WMP11 card by Linksys . What a joke ! Tech support is as bad as the product . The card made my comp crash so bad , I had to re-format the hard drive .. yes everything gone . Never got it working . The manual is badly written . The first time in years that I 've had any trouble installing anything . Word of wisdom .. stay away from this product . I had to give it 1 star ( which it doesn't deserve that ) . I could go on but what 's the use ..  
2	  I recently upgraded my stock Hewlett Packard Pavillion 9895 speakers to the Yamaha YSTMS50W 80-Watt 3-Piece Subwoofer / Satellite Computer Speakers . First and foremost , let me tell you one thing : wow , and I really mean WOW , what a great set of computer speakers ! Understand : you don't get full blown surround sound with these speakers - few PC applications necessitate this type of audio quality anyway . But unlike the higher end 5.1 and 6.1 speakers on the market today , these speakers will , out of the box , work with and optimize the performance of most stock sound cards . And this is important if you want to get superior performance at a reasonable cost . My only complaint ( and it is an exeedingly * small * one ) is that the audio controls are split between one satellite speaker ( volume and on / off ) and the sub woofer ( base volume ) - it would be more convenient to have all audio controls on one unit ( i.e. on a satellite speaker ) . But I can more than live with this almost negligible inconvenience to get the type of sound that these speakers deliver for the price . Net / net : 1 ) Awesome ( I would even say unsurpassed ) sound quality to cost ratio2 ) Extremely easy set-up ( took me less than 10 minutes - and this included carrying the box up the stairs to my PC room ) 3 ) Wished the connecting wires were longer ( the ones that came with my unit restrict satellite speaker placement to within 5 feet of the sub-woofer ) 4 ) Needs some industrial design tweaks ( i.e. audio controls should all be in one place ) 5 ) Rich base , sweet high-ends , and earth shaking volume for you hard rockers or gamers6 ) MUST HAVE FOR ANY AUDIOPHILE WHO IS ON A BUDGET  
2	  I have had Canon printers for 10 years now , and have always been impressed . Currently I have the i9900 . When paired with this ink , it gives fantastic results ! Buy the ink elsewhere though . Amazon does not do free shipping for this item . The ink is just over eight bucks , but shipping is seven and a half - EACH !  
2	  Bought these speakers new in 2005 for $ 275 and have used them daily for more than 7 years . They never let me down and still sound absolutely amazing to this day .  
1	  Just got the computer last week . I have spent many hours trying to make it work . Right out of the box , I get the message that the recovcery drive D is full . It has only 8 gb . I tried to enlarge the partition , but that option doesn't appear on the menu . You can only make it smaller . Then I tried to set up my email accounts . The box for the set up is too small . The options at the bottom , re secure server , etc . don't even show up . There is no way you can get to them , therefore , you cannot set up any email accounts . Well , a computer which can't receive your emails is worthless . I called ' tech support . ' What a misnomer . Sounded like I got Mumbai . After giving him all my info , except for my dog 's name , he said I would have to pay $ 69 for the support call . This for a one week old computer which doesn't work right out of the box . I should have known not to get HP . Last year , I bought an HP laptop . Right out of the box , the screen was very dim . The analysis system on the computer found that the screen was defective . The store exchanged it for another one . Same problem . I returned it and got a refund . Luckily , it was Costco , which doesn't give you any hassle . To me it appears that HP 's only goal is to increase profits so that it looks good on Wall Street . Let 's see how much hassle Amazon will give me in trying to return this piece of junk .  
1	  cheap you can hear the wind on the cord while just walking have to turn sound up high so you don't hear noise I read this in other reviews and didn't think it was a problem it is . had a set of v-moda 's before that sounded great but had a bad plug arrangement , but i 'm not sure about the company now . not worth the money . read all the reviews  
2	  If you 've read down far enough to find this review , you probably already know that these are the professional studio monitor headphones used by pretty much anyone with a mixing board - from Celine Dion to Slipknot , from NFL broadcasts to The Howard Stern Show , these are the way most recording artists and studios hear every note and nuance . If you 're not already convinced , read on . Most new 7506 owners are awed by their headphones before even hearing them , at least by the packaging . The headphones themselves rest on gently tousled silver silk behind a clear plastic window emblazoned with a large gold " 7506 " . The presentation alone gives the potential buyer the feel of buying a giant engagement ring , but the theatrics end once you open the box . Getting down to business inside is a very serious schematic diagram documenting the complete parts and assembly list of the fifty or so pieces that go into making this single pair of headphones , a 1/8 " to 1/4 " adapter ( the screw-on type , a must for live use ) , and a pleather carrying pouch . The 7506s are visually almost an anti-climax to the packaging . The design is very basic and straightforward without any tricks or frills , but simplicity is part of the appeal here . Every detail has been engineered to work simply and simply work . The steel band size adjustment snicks into place confidently at each numbered groove . Both earcups rotate vertically a full 180 degrees on their hinges with ease . The 1/8 " plug has an all-metal casing with a real rubber sleeve , as you 'd find on actual pro audio music cables . The more deeply you look into each element of the design , the more you 'll appreciate how much Sony also looked into it . Putting on the 7506s is also an easy affair , thanks to their eight ounce weight and modest profile . They 're actually small enough that you could get away with wearing them in public , but you wouldn't hear much else - the closed design combined with cushy stuffed vinyl pads and secure , if not tailored , fit means the ambient sound isolation borders on noise-cancelling . The earcups can also be folded upwards against the inside of the headband for portability - so portable in fact , that you could place a folded set of 7506s in a child 's lunchbox * with room to spare * . But if ever a good thing came in a small package , it 's the big sound of these headphones . Ruler flat response , deep sound stage , and sniper tight accuracy means every aspect of the source signal comes to life and is revealed in full . Bass notes come through with such authority that you find yourself occasionally making note of your feet , to see if you can feel the bass in the floor . Instrument placement is at once obvious - parsing out where each instrument and sound is in a mix is instantly clear . Previously hidden and obscure sounds and passages in various tracks stand out so well that entire songs are made new again . There just isn't any sound that the 7506s can't reproduce exactly as you 'd hear it with your own ears . Those of you who like to tailor your sound with extra helpings of bass or volume have also been accommodated - On the low end , using even the most basic bass boost the 7506s can faithfully reproduce subwoofers in the trunk neighborhood-wide bass * in your head * . I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't heard it myself . Volume-wise , a low impedance matched with a high power handing capacity means these headphones are easily driven by an iPod or Walkman , yet can easily achieve volume levels that could liquefy your inner ear without even the implication of distorting . Plainly speaking , whatever you want the 7506s to do , they 'll do it with ease . Keep in mind that revealing everything requires a good source . Plugging these into a cheaper portable or poorly EQ 'd equipment will quickly make any and all limitations evident . This includes cheap computer audio hardware and low frequency / bandwidth MP3s . Uncompressed file formats suddenly seem a lot more practical when you can hear the constraints of highly compressed MP3s . " Audiophile " sites and reviews have had a hard time coming to grips with these headphones . Being that they 're a consumer brand product available at any common music store at a fraction of the price of most other high-end models , the " elite " image and price tag that goes along with it just aren't a part of the 7506 's game . It 's reflected in some reviews , some saying they 're " too bassy " , others " too bright " , but how exactly is this possible if you 're using a decent source and the same headphones the musicians / engineers used to create the recording ? You 're hearing the music exactly as it was heard in the studio , exactly as it was meant to be heard . Only the 7506s can make that promise . If you 're creating any kind of recordings and find yourself crossing your fingers that you 're hearing it as it 's actually being recorded , or just a music lover who feels it 's time to hear the music as it was meant to be heard , you 're only a hundred dollars away from the Sony MDR-7506 . Five stars and my highest recommendation to Sony 's masterpiece .  
2	  I purchased the P3 International P4460 Kill A Watt EZ Electricity Usage Monitor as a gift for my husband , and he has been using it all over the house . It is very easy to use and program , and with the addition of a short extension cord , the meter can be left anywhere handy to read , even if plugged in behind a refrigerator . If I had to fault the meter on any one thing , it would be that the dial has no light , and the lettering is small ( numbers are fine ) . It took a flashlight to read the dial in many cases . The directions should also explain all the various electrical measurements . They list them all , but give no explanation of what they mean . They also don't mention overload protection , just maximum wattage for the meter . I got the feeling several times the temporary starting load of an appliance might cause the meter to fail . I would highly recommend this product to anyone , the results it gives are in some cases very surprising and revealing .  
2	  This product is great . It secures the Zune tightly to my arm , never comes loose , and stays clean .  
1	  I bought a pair of these headphones based on a review I read in a magazine . It said something about being the most bang for the buck . Although I prefer the earpiece wires to be symmetrical in length , the different lengths were not a big deal for me . They look great , and the fit of the headphones themselves is very good ( comfortable and will not easily fall out ) . The issue I have with these is the sound quality . For headphones which sit directly in the ear canal , they sound a little too muffled for my taste . I was expecting a much cleaner / crisper sound from them . Although they are not terrible , I find them to be lacking in the fidelity department . Would I buy them again ? The answer is no , which is why I only gave the item 2 stars .  
2	  received this ipod in great conditionhas all the things that i wantedworks great  
1	  A fantastic piece of junk . I read a CNET review on this product where the user complained that installing the Lexmark s / w created boot problems with XP . I thought that rather odd , until I noticed them myself . First off , the software took a good 20 minutes to install on my relatively fast PC . Then , when I attempted to reboot my computer , all I saw was a black screen with a cursor waiting . I couldn't even get into the BIOS to boot in normal mode . Luckiily , I 'd read that the user unplugged the USB cable and was able to boot after that . Once I unplugged the USB cable , I was able to boot . Needless to say , I 'm currently uninstalling all things Lexmark right now . Not-so-happy Camper . A fantastic piece of junk !  
2	  They all work . But I hate buying things made in sweat shops . I would not want to work in a sweat shop . I believe the workers that made these get less than one dollar an hour . And are forced to work long hours . I feel guilty buying these .  
2	  What 's not to love , the original Canon inks are the only thing I have used in my i960 that is now going on nine years old .  
2	  This is the cheapest memory card I 've seen ( with 8GB ) . Works perfect ! Holds all I want and more !  
2	  I previously had an Epson 850Z digital camera , but was constantly missing those key photo moments on our 2 yr old daugter . I read the reviews and narrowed my selection to this Kodak and the Canon 300 . I tested them at Best Buy and found this camera to be quicker-quicker from the time you pressed the buttom till the photo snapped-key with a 2 yr old that won't sit still . I have been 100 % satisfied with this camera in all settings and environments . The movie function is a nice addition , thought beware , the file size gets large quickly . Highly recommend this camera for both beginners and intermediate users-can't beat the features for the price . I 've had the camera for 3 months now and don't regret my decision one bit . Great camera .  
2	  the cam is good for simple video veiwing .. i would like to know if i can order cone caps to fit this cam .  
1	  On my 3rd one , Tsch support told me the first two were defective . Now 3rd doesn't work either . 3 computers , 2 different routers , 3 different cameras . I regret ever buying this camera !  
1	  This is the first portable cd player I was actually willing to spend some money on since I 've started college . The first day I listened to it , I already had problems with the lock mechanism staying locked . Also , I thought I had a faulty headphone jack because it kept shorting out , but my friend also bought one too and her headphone jack was not in very good working condition too . I was willing to overlook the problems , and a few days later , I was very upset at the fact that the cd player would not play anything . It would not get off the hold mechanism . I thought maybe it was the batteries and it wasn't . Now , I haven't been able to play anything on it for a week and I 'm going to send it back . Every time I press any button , " hold " flashes on the screen even though it is not on hold . I never dropped it and always took good care of it-it just must be of very poor quality . I definitely recommend NOT buying this item . Aiwa is not a good brand and I know I 'll never purchase anything under that brand name again .  
2	  I am writing a pre-purchase review . I am trying to decide between the sansa c-250 and the sansa e-250 . I have read a few comments in the reviews here , but am still undecided . I don't think there is a big difference in size , but the e-250 may be easier to hold in one hand and operate while driving . But , the C is cheaper , and cost is an issue for me . Is the E really worth the extra $ ? Update : I bought the e250 instead of the c250 and I 'm very satisfied . However , if you only want to put music on the player , as I do , the c is probably all you need . Especially for the money , but I knew my wife would eventually want an ipod and the e resembled the ipod , so I knew when she saw it she would want the e over the ipod . She already had a player that resembled the c and now , yes , she has already asked me if I 'm going to get her an e250 .  
2	  It 's a B + W filter what more is there to say , except they are pricey . I owned oneand gave it to my brother when I sold the lens that it fit . I also use Hoya , Pro1 Marumi MCand Vivitar Series 1 which are all excellent filters .  
2	  This case is great for my Canon Elura100 . There 's plenty of room for ALL of the accessories that come with the camcorder , and for extra miniDV tapes too . All the interior compartments are mesh and all can be closed with sturdy zippers . Shoulder strap is included . Although the exterior is slightly reinforced , the case is truly " soft " . If you 're looking for a case to travel light with then this is the one .  
2	  I 've tried many different brands of earbuds ( and one other product line from V-MODA ) and this is hands down my favorite pair of earbuds ever . The sound quality is excellent . The silicone adapters ensure a perfect fit . They 're durable . I have zero complaints and will definitely be buying and recommending this product line again .  
1	  Two weeks after receiving this product , the plastic clips on both ends of the network cable snapped off , and even when held in place , it does not provide a connection .  
2	  I 've purchased two of these and been extremely satisfied with both . This product is light enough to carry in my laptop bag and allow me to use my laptop on my lap without getting my legs scorched . By elevating the rear , providing a space under the laptop and running four fans , this product greatly helps to lower the tempurature of both my laptops ( one HP and one Mac PowerBook ) . I highly recommend this product !  
1	  For anyone wondering , this is not made in USA although they are charging a premium price . It is made in China . The country of origin is not marked anywhere on the product . I had to call and wait 10 minutes for an answer to the simple question of country of origin .  
2	  I bought this enclosure so I could use it with my HD that was recently removed from my iMac . Using the Firewire cable , I have been able to access my old data , including the ability to transfer my data to the new OS installation . ( This cable is included , which is worth an extra STAR , in my opinion . I do have a Firewire cable , but I don't remember this being in the item description and I find that to be a definite bonus . ) Definitely a top-notch product . Easy to use and it looks nice sitting on my desktop . As an IT consultant , I have owned 15-20 different HD enclosures , and would rate this one as the best . Both in terms of features and style . I wouldn't have any problems leaving this with any of my clients , even the ones that are very particular about the quality of items they are purchasing from me . Highly recommended !  
1	  Bought the code ; xbox told me it 's already been used . Now I 'm out 20 dollars .  
1	  I folowed the installation instructions to the letter , but my Windows XP Found New Hardware wizard pop-up stated : " There was a problem installing this hardware : USB Device . An error occurred during the installation of the device . Access is denied . " An e-mail inquiry to D-Link was not answered .  
2	  Even though this cable was designed for audio use , we were able to replace the hundreds of cables we have in our data center with this one cable .  
2	  I 'm stunned by this tinny digital camera ! So little and so many functions .. I recomend it .  
1	  I have yet to be able to span several CD 's to backup my drive , which was the reason for buying it . After the second CD I get an error where the software says it can't find the next CD , when I put it in , it blows out the program completely .. coasters everywhere and time down the tubes . I even bought QuickSync 3.0 . That is no big help . Makes exact copies fine . Copies data files fine . Setup an HP 8220 or 8230 , that one didn't work until I downloaded upgraded software . Then it seemed fine . Haven't tried a multi-CD backup with it . HP 9500 internal is the best I 've worked with so far . Runs pretty fast and does pop up errors often . Haven't tried a multi-CD backup with it .  
1	  I purchased the Logitech X-240 speaker system from Circuit City right before they went out of business - I paid $ 30 for these . These speakers are a huge upgrade from the rear-mounted ones that were installed in my monitor . After over two years with these speakers , I can say they are just not very good . First off the " subwoofer " is incredibly sloppy . It struggles to keep up in nearly every instance - i 'm pretty sure it 's incapable of doing anything besides making deep sounding " rumbly " noises . Secondly , the speakers only have a single 1.5 " speaker in each of them . The speaker is supposed to handle mid-range and your highs - a typical speaker might have a . 75 " tweeter for the highs and a 3.5 " speaker for the midrange . However , the geniuses at Logitech decided to meet halfway and go with the 1.5 " speaker . This means that the highs sound terrible and the mid-range sounds terrible . Infact , everything sounds terrible . It 's not helped by the cheap , light-weight enclosures that resonate and make a buzzing sound when they hit a certain frequency . Because of this , the dialogue in movies is hard to hear only to have other sounds come across as being loud and boomy . Music sounds okay , but you feel like you are missing a lot of the subtlties . Gaming is probably the one thing these things do pretty well . Again , dialogue is hard to hear but in most games this is not an issue and the farty bass does okay at adding some " oomph " to guns , explosions , etc . All in all , it was a dissapointing 2 years and I 'm very glad I upgraded .  
1	  The micro disk was the wrong size yet you suggested it for my main purchase . The one should have been the MICRO DISK . Now I am stuck with a disk that is too large for my product !  
2	  This was a great portable flashdrive for storage of data to be taken from my home computer to school for projects . Lots of storage space and a great price . I ordered two for my kids . Easier than burning CDs and much less fragile . Thanks !  
1	  Vendor claimed they would no longer provide this item through Amazon because of numerous difficulties . It was a shame because they were the cheapest source of these projection lamps I was able to find .  
1	  I got a multi-pack of these and burned CD 's for stocking stuffers for my family . I think they are thicker than normal CD 's because they got stuck in 2 CD players .. one is in my car and I still can't get it out . DON'T PURCHASE  
2	  Though it may take a while to charge it up on cloudy days , this little solar charger is great for traveling for your laptop or camera , even MP3 players . I would highly recommend it .  
2	  Great disk for the price and performance . Fast access time , reliable product . Would buy this again for my Server and NAS Storage unit  
2	  Terrific value for the money . Sound is very clear and warm . Upper range and midrange as good as very expensive corded phones and speaker systems . The bass is not muddy , but it is less pronounced than with good speakers or corded phones . But the overall sound is still excellent . Requires a good deal of adjustment and fiddling to get the best sound and longest transmition range out of it . Don't set the level on the transmitter too high . You will get speaker overload . You can listen throughout your home , patio , and garage . But you generally get some bursts of static as you walk . None of these drawbacks bothers me . Best for listening to CD 's . Sounds great with LP 's too , but it transmits more groove wall noise and static than you are probably used to hearing from the RIAA jacks that your turntable is connected to .  
2	  Excellent sound quality for very little money . I 'm no " professional " or " critic " or anything ; I just know what I like . And I like a lot of bass which these provide along with a nice balance w / treble and other ranges . No vibration , no feedback . They also have a setting so you can adjust the sound depending if you 're listening to music or movies . They are also very comfortable to wear , and although not advertised as " sound cancelling " I didn't hear any outside interference . Personally , I say you get a lot of bang for your buck . Now I 'm just disappointed that my computer can't push more volume thru them ! Gotta go - ROCKIN ' OUT !  
2	  The Polaroid PDV-0700 is a good value for the price . I bought it for my young kids to watch their movies and cartoons in the car during long trips , so for that purpose it is fine . The picture is not the sharpest and the colors are not the most precise , but my girls aren't too concerned with that . The audio from the unit 's built-in speakers is tinny and bassless , as can be expected from such tiny speakers , but if you buy a cassette adapter and play it through the car stereo it sounds great . It performs well and can handle the most common disc formats , including playback of discs full of JPEG pictures , which is useful as an electronic photo album when you go to visit family and friends . We got it for under $ 200 , which is less than we paid for the bulky 9 " TV / VCR combo we used in the car before this .  
2	  For ( .. ) bucks there is simply no way you will do better than this . After reading a review in Maximum PC I decided to give them a try despite hearing many horrible labtec speakers in the past . You cannot spend less than ( high price ) and come away with a better 3-piece speaker setup than this . Because of the price and great quality , I 'm even thinking of buying another set and hooking up a 4.2 ( 4 sats 2 subs ) setup .. Amazing subwoofer , great satellites , even more amazing price . Buy these now .  
1	  Before buying this card , I read some reviews on how great this card was , I read some reviews on how horrible this card was . I was attracted by the price and bought this card . The warranty sounded great so I took a gamble . I totally regret this purchase . I 've been losing 2-3 pictures for every 300 pictures I took and this is consistently a problem . I 've tried to contact Viking for weeks with no response . Either they are back logged with many many calls requesting a product replacement or they really don't care about customer service . Viking really has poor quality products . I used SanDisk and no problems encountered . I 'm taking the time to write this review for those on the fence about purchasing any Viking products . I would stay away . If their website is any indication of their attention to quality and detail , it crashes when you try to get " Live help " , or click on " Feedback " links . When you try to process an " Online Product Replacement " , it forces you to enter zip codes to USA when customers such as myself are Canadian . They really make you jump through hoops to get your product fixed . I 'm still jumping . Wish me luck and I hope you are much luckier than me if you plan on purchasing Viking products .  
1	  This product could have been very good . The problem is that it seems it was never tested before release and the firmware was never finished . The " power on / off " button doesn't even work . You can't complain to Netgear as the support site email trouble reporting doesn't work either . Half of the remote control functions are non-functional . The only way I can turn it off after use is to unplug the power cord , then when I plug it back in , it powers itself up , then the power button works to turn it off . Seem to be literally hundreds of bugs in the original firmware and there is no sign of an update release . The strange thing is that the tough stuff works ( WiFi , PC library interface , etc ) and the simple stuff fails . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS NETGEAR FIXES THE FIRMWARE .  
1	  Every single tape rewinder I 've bought has died prematurely . This Kinyo worked fine for about a year , which is why it got 2 stars . But it 's the last one I 'm ever buying . From now on we 'll use old VCR machines to do our rewinding !  
2	  When I bought my Nikon D80 , the lenses that came with it were the 18-55mm and 55-200mm , but until I bought this lens I hadn't realized I was missing out on so much better pictures ! Basically I bought the lens because it was the cheapest one I could find , but only after reading all the reviews and tech specs . I like this lens a lot , and think that it should come standard with the nikon cameras . The only thing I don't like about it is sometimes the Automatic focus acts strangely , but I like using it on Manual anyways . Also recommend if you buy any lens that you keep a clear filter on it .  
1	  I wore them recently at a lan party . They are pretty heavy and my ears felt sweaty in about 15 minutes . Other gamers had better fitting models by other companies . I 'm thinking of trading up to a set of LTB 's , they fit alot better and sounded better too . - Sorry .  
2	  I purchased to go with my Toshiba 42 HD projection TV . Sure its not a $ 1,000 system but it works fine and has excellent audio and video output . Sounds as good as my $ 500 Sony setup that I have upstairs . No Problems .. would recommend ( and I have ) for someone else to purchase . B.G.12-26-04 NOW after 11 months , I get the dreaded Protection Error Good Bye display . Looks like a hassle with Toshiba coming up , please do not purchase . If they don't give me a problem ( surprise ) .. I 'll be Back to update .. Finally got it repaired . They replaced bad capacitor C27 .. worked fine for about 60 days now May 5 , 2005 , Same old Protection Error - Good Bye - I wish I could give Negative 5 Stars !  
2	  I grill a lot , and have been getting more and more involved with " long and slow " cooking , which involves careful control of grill temperature . Did a lot of research before deciding which therm was best suited for me . The Maverick ET-73 is far and away the thermometer of choice on several barbeque forums and other reviews were strong , so I leapt . I have since cooked five briskets , which are on the grill for 8-9 hours each , controlling grill temp between 225 and 240 , without having to lift the lid to know when to open and close the vents or when to add more coals . Cooking in outside temps in the 30s , it would have been impossible to keep a constant temp in the grill if I had been lifting the lid to check all the time . In addition , the other probe kept careful watch on the temperature of the meat . And the best part was , having started each of these at 2:00 in the morning , I was able to sit inside and watch the monitor , without freezing out on the deck ! You can set alarms for meat temp and high and low grill temp , which is great . However , if I could , I would only give it 4.5 stars because setting the alarms is a pain in the neck - they need to make it so that you can go up OR down , not just up . However , this is no reason to go with another thermometer , because this is simply the best I have ever owned , far and away . ALSO , I initially found one on line for $ 5 less and ordered it , had nothing but trouble ( non-receipt , no response from vendor , horrible service ) , so I ordered this one from Amazon . Price was still terrific , shipping was free , and I got it in two days ! Strongly recommending Amazon to friends these days .  
2	  Got this for my dad and he loves it . Darn near half the price from the bose headphones and I literally see little difference . I got these because I went to CES ( Consumer Electronic Show ) and continually went booth to booth trying on several headsets and these were one of the most comfortable and affordable . Noise-canceling is good , but the person next to you on a plane more than hear everything . Overall , great product .  
1	  Be Careful to note the EXACT model of your telephones . I thought I had it right and did not . There was not an adapter available locally so I have to return the unit and try again .  
2	  Bought this item for less than $ 80 including shipping and handling . Great item so far for its function and price .  
1	  I received this as a birthday present . Supposedly a good deal of research went into its purchase , but seeing how it performs , I 'm not sure it was enough . I 've barely done any printing with it , partly because most of the time I haven't been able to get the computer and printer to talk to each other . I made sure all the drivers were up to date , which helped some , but it still will switch back and forth between connected and disconnected once every second sometimes , which makes it impossible to print or scan . I also am having serious issues with print quality . More often than not , there will be lines of faint or non-existent printing where it should be bold and clear . This is true for both text and photos . Additionally , despite having printed well under 100 pages , almost certainly less than 50 , I cannot at this point print anything besides blue / cyan and greyscale / black . I wouldn't waste your money on this printer .  
2	  I bought this camera for my Mom ( aged 73 ) for Christmas ! It took me exactly 1 hour to teach her how to use most of the features ! The book was very easy to follow . She uses the camera frequently , so she will get used to the features . The pictures are great !  
2	  This monitor is marvellous . Very easy to install . Comes with a free DVI cable , no hassle setup . It has all the bells and whistles that you would look for in a perfect monitor . The colors are too good . Brightness is perfect . The stand is adjustable according to your viewing preferences . You can watch DVD movies in actual wide-screen format because this monitor has an aspect ratio of 16:10 . You will only see a small rectangular bar on the top and bottom when watching DVDs programmed in 16:9 ratio . 8 millisecond response time renders smooth videos . Active TFT display means you can watch it from any angle in your living room . I watch it even at 70 degree angles and it looks good enough . The black finish adds elegance to your room . The power transformer ( to convert 120 or 250 volts to 12 volts ) is built inside the monitor . So you won't see ugly cables outside . The monitor cable to connect to your computer is also neatly tucked inside the monitor 's casing . To enjoy the monitor to the fullest extent , you need a good video card that supports very high resolutions and has a DVI output . If your computer has DVI output , make sure you connect the monitor using the DVI cable provided . The output is impeccable when using DVI signal . Even VGA signal is not bad , but DVI is too good . The monitor has built in speakers . But I would suggest not to depend on this feature . The speakers are ok for web-chatting , VOIP calls , etc . But when watching DVD or listening to audio , you may want to go for external speakers and not depend on the speakers this monitor provides . Also if you turn on the speaker to full volume , the monitor sometimes flickers . Reason is both monitor and speakers are using the same power source and the power source may not be able to support the extra wattage required when the speakers are at the maximum sound level . In summary , do go for this monitor TODAY . Don't wait an extra day . You will love your purchase . Please don't go for the ACER monitors that are available for the same price . They don't have all the features that are available in this monitor . Also make sure you shop around for the best prices . This monitor is the best selling monitor of 2006 . Hence lot of online sites are offering very competitive prices . Also if you are tight on budget you can go for the 19 " ViewSonic monitor . They are very competitively priced though they are only an inch shorter . Enjoy  
1	  I purchased this based on the recommendation from Amazon about what a great add-on this product is . It was great - the one time it worked . Unfortunately , I needed to leave the country ( on vacation ) so I didn't get a chance to return it the time limit . I 'm glad it was less than $ 10 but I guess I got what I paid for . Maybe I got a reject from the factory because the other customer reviews were good .  
2	  If you need a battery that you can depend on , spend the few extra dollars and go with the original .  
1	  I bought this product took it home , installed itunes , purchased 100 songs and downloaded them to my Nano . While the Nano rocks I got an auto popup to update my itunes . exe so I did . It lost my $ 100.00 bucks worth of songs and would not do a restore from my backup CD 's . I could not get a hold of apple support . They did not answer emails and I could not find a phone number to call . The next itunes update I installed said it could not run on my hardware . My laptop is two years old and runs great . I have XP pro with all updates and nothing else has a problem . I could not contact apple to find out why my audio hardware needed to be updated just to download songs to my Nano ? I do not recommend apple products because of the support and you can only download from one application . John  
2	  This modem was a snap to set up and has worked flawlessly for the past month . We didn't see any substantial download / upload speed increases , but it has eliminated the issues we had with our previous ( rented ) modem dying every few days - and also saves us money in the long term from having to rent from Comcast .  
1	  I had been a fan of these Logitech Harmony Universal remotes for the past couple years now , but I hate to say that I 'm finished with them . I 've been through three in that time , for a total of $ 370 , this model 676 being the last . When they work , they are wonderful . But each of mine only worked for a few months , then , I guess the buttons wear out . I am the only one who uses it so it 's not as if it 's gotten extraordinary use . Logitech 's tech support is very poor , even though I made it to " Level 2 " , they still put me through the same troubleshooting paces I had done myself , over and over again without success , and even though it 's still under warranty , they refuse to replace it ! So I 'm sitting here with 3 very expensive paperweights . I 'm surely not going to try for the more expensive ones ! If the $ 150 ones can't cut it , I 'm done . As a result of my experience , I can't recommend them . So I 'm back to juggling 5 remotes . :(  
1	  I notice that none of the people who praise this product mention what theirs looks like exactly . The thing I got is not labeled " Merkury " and is a different shape than the one in the main photo on this page . Mine has labels " power " , " usb2.0 " , and " Targus " . I don't know whether Amazon or the seller got the picture wrong , or maybe this whole page is mislabeled and it 's really about a completely different product ( Mercury Innovations ? ) , or maybe Targus has changed what they sell under this SKU number ( but then , why re-use a cursed SKU number ? ) . However , the device I got matches the photo that 's on Targus 's own page for the TGR-CRD25 . Anyway I am just barely able to use my Targus-labled thing with two old ( circa 2001-2003 ) Macs . These Macs have USB 1.0 ports . I 've never got the Targus to work plugged directly into a USB 1.0 port , but by plugging it into a USB 2.0 hub connected to the Mac , I have some luck . I use it to connect a 4 GB SD card . It almost never works just by plugging it in and plugging the card into it . Here is the procedure that has eventually worked for me every time so far : Plug the cable into a USB 2.0 hub or USB 2.0 port on your computer . Unplug the other end of the cable from the Targus . Plug the memory card into the Targus . Now , plug the cable into the Targus and wait a second . If the blue power light goes on solid , it 's failed , unplug , wait a couple seconds and repeat . If the blue light blinks a few times , you 're in business . No way am I guaranteeing this will work for you . But , if you 're desperate or too lazy to return the thing ( like me ) it might be worth a try . Well , maybe five or ten tries .  
1	  Had for a little over a month . Camera broke on trip to Costa Rica . Not at all durable . Met someone with same broken camera . Buy at your own risk .  
1	  I must review this product step by step , just like is shown in the product details , I also have to say that I shuold look for reviews in cnet . com . I do regret I payed such money , they sound exactly like the cheap low quality you recieve in national flights .. Deep yet precise bass - ZERO BASSPassive noise isolation reduces ambient noise without batteries - ZERO NOISE ISOLATIONV-MASQUE driver delivers warm mids and crisp highs - THEY ARE NOT THAT CLEAR REGARDS SOUNDBLISS silicon tips in three sizes for maximum comfort - NO THAT COMFORTABLEAward-winning design in an array of colors - IRRELEVANT BECAUSE I CONSIDER MOST IMPORTANT THE PERFORMANCE  
1	  I bought this router so I wouldn't monopolize the DSL line in our house when playing Everquest . The problem is that when I use this router Everquest always disconnects within 5 minutes . I made three calls to tech support without resolving the problem , though we did eventually narrow it down : the router seems to insist on holding onto a few port addresses that Everquest expects to use for itself . After several long waits for short and unsuccessful conversations with tech support I tried using their web site to reach a resolution . I posted my case in July . Now it 's October . I can still see my posting on the site , but I never received anything other than an automatic acknowledgement of the problem report . The box won't do the one thing I need . The phone support is ineffective . The web support is non-existent . Money wasted .  
2	  I am so glad I purchased this for my IPod , I have small grandchildren .. that should explain the need for the cover . It has protected my IPod , also a great value .  
2	  I mixed these speakers with a set of six and a half three way speakers in my small truck and wow what an improvement in sound quality in highs and mid bass . I would recommend them highly for small spaces .  
1	  At first glance , the DL0129 hot shoe slave appears to be a steal : inexpensive , wireless remote hot shoe slave . Unfortunately , I 've found that the flash pickup sensor does not always work , and when it does , it 's not able to fire the flash quickly enough to make a difference in the photo . ( The delays appear to be as slow as 1/5 to 1/15 of a second . ) If you 're doing some very specific long-exposure shots that require a fill flash ( ie . , to " freeze " some action ) , this might work . Otherwise , pay a little more and get a hot shoe slave that works for a majority of situations .  
2	  it is not the very high quality mount but still ok i use it with the first model of etrexbut it is not waterproof , it does not give the good sealing with the etrex body as the original one does  
1	  This is the worst and I mean WORST Apple product I have ever used ! I bought one with my money because I was replacing my dead 3rd Generation iPod . I liked how small it was , and since I only needed 512 MB , it was a good buy for $ 99 in May 2006 . But then only a month later , I was listening to it on the bus and it died suddenly . It wouldn't turn on , but Apple gave me a new shuffle . Once again it died and it wouldn't come back to life . I got a pink nano for Christmas and that is way better than this piece of trash . I don't reccommend this iPod to anyone !  
1	  I have a Canon Pixma MP470 . After I installed the ink cartridge it began to leak and caused a lot of problems . I won't be purchasing this again .  
2	  I was concerned about this purchase due to the negative reviews on this site , however , I was pleasantly suprised with the outstanding performance of these earphones . The reproduction lets you hear EVERYTHING from the recording . I didn't get this performance initially , but found the following adjustments did achieve outstanding sound - I have a Sansa and the items following refer primarily to that device . 1 . The fit is critical and not easy to accomplish without some trial and error . It greatly affects base response , but with the proper adjustments , the base is very good . It won't vibrate the ears off your head , but the overall level is certainly similar to Bose . Once you learn how to fit them , its a snap . 2 . You need to make level adjustments . For my SANSA ; its in the Music - Music Options - Music EQ menu . The default " Normal " will not satisfy most users . Here you can increase the base level with a " Rock " or " Dance " selection . 3 . The quality of your recording greatly affects the sound you hear . Compare your downloaded recordings with the samples supplied with the Sansa . For instance the Hip Hop recording Heavyweight Dub .. has heavy base , reverb , etc . This is what the earphones are capable of but you need to start with a good copy . I very happy and I 'm keeping mine !  
1	  I have used a D-Ling router for years and decided to upgrade to this " N " router . After 10 + hours on their support line speaking with about 6 different techs I was finally told it was a defective router and it should be returned for a replacement . I recieved the same router back . It still did not work . I am very familiar with setting up wireless routers . I contacted the D-Link a second time but did not get a response . This router was a waste of money .  
1	  I recived my sub put it on the X-over and pushed play it was ok . there was an air leak the front plexiglass isn't level and speaker died at 10 watts with no clpping Amazon sending replacement will update when it arrives . second box was the same quality the speaker also cannot take anywhere near even 100 watts crap is best word for this item .  
1	  It is May 11 , 2007 and Amazon is still trying to sell a 1.5 megapixel camera for $ 599 ! I haven't checked , but maybe they have some beachfront property in Kansas to go with it . . .  
1	  If the author of the above blurb would indicate the I / F ( USB , parallel or SCSI ) that this thing uses it would sure help making a purchase decision !  
1	  This looked like a great deal . It was the perfect size , looked great , and offered all the features we needed . Out of the box , the wiring was finicky , and there was a terrible frequency coming out of the speakers when turned on with the volume all the way down . This is the worst system I have ever owned . I regret selling my previous components in a yard sale because this looked like a great deal in the store . The first unit started skipping within the first week . Within the first month , the image froze , and a terrible blasting sound came out of the speakers . It never turned on again . It was returned to the store , cash was handed over and I went to another big box chain and purchased the same unit . The second unit lasted about two months before it started skipping with DVDs and CDs . Discs would freeze up at random . Reluctantly , we kept the unit out of obligation . We couldn't sell it with a good conscience . After 3 years , the unit has developed a habit of making 3-4 loud POPS when turning on . The remote control hardly works . It is not due to dead batteries or drops . The entire unit is a hunk of junk . I regret ever buying the thing . Avoid at all costs .  
1	  I got this set to use with my Panasonic Lumix G1 and 45-200 lens . The first thing I noticed was the filters were filthy ( about par for cheap filters ) . Also , there was a spot on the + 1 and a big smudge on the + 2 that would not come off . I was able to autofocus well through the filters . However , the image quality degraded when using the filters . It was the equivalent of losing resolution-going in 1:1 showed blurry pixels instead of crisp ones . I asked for a refund and got one from the seller . If you care about image quality , try another brand . Right now , so far so good with the Tiffen set . Rating : two stars because it is functional .  
1	  This card did not work in anything I own except for my laptop . Being a class 6 I hoped it would work in my car stereo ( Phase Linear UV8020 . I wouldn't recommend it unless you already knew it would work in your device !  
1	  This screen protector was impossible to apply and no matter what I did I could not get all the bubbles out or get the corners to stick . I even tried the trick with the tape that they suggsted and it did nothing . I ended up having to take it off and throw it out . This time around I guess I got what I paid for I bought cheap so I got cheap .  
1	  I ordered these as a replacement for the earbuds which came with my Sansa hoping to get an improvement in sound quality . I was very disappointed at first because they had almost no bass . After playing around with them for a few days ( and cussing a lot and writing a scathing review ) I discovered that I had not inserted them properly in my ears . They should go into the ear canal until a seal is formed , almost like you 're trying to seal out water . Then the bass kicks in . The sound quality was much better when properly inserted . Overall a big improvement over the stock Sansa buds . Should be 4 stars , but I can't edit the rating .  
1	  I have have already exchanged these speakers once , and i am going to return them again . They sound good when you first turn them on , but as time goes on , they start to crackle , pop , and make windy sounds . This continued even when they were disconnected from the computer . I do not reccomend these .  
1	  Worked fine for about the first month or two , but has gradually gotten worse . I don't even try to print photographs anymore , and right now it 's barely printing out text documents . I don't use it that much , maybe once or twice a week , but it 's becoming pointless . I have run through all the diagnostic and cleaning functions - replaced the ink .. nothing is happening . oh well .  
2	  Open firmware is the ONLY reason to buy this router . Sure it 's a great router , but at this point it 's more than a bit behind the times . If you don't plan on putting one of the many open source after market firmwares on this you really should look elsewhere . If you are looking to put after market firmware ( ex : DD-WRT ) on a router then look no further . I 've flashed 4 or 5 of these guys at this point without any problems . Each time I keep expecting to get burned but it hasn't happened yet . I use DD-WRT and have found that it offers SIGNIFICANTLY more functionality and control than more modern routers costing 4-5x what the WRT54GL does .  
2	  As expected , the memory worked fine , obviously just " plug " and use .. and 0 problems . - Is the second time that i do the same ( bougth the computer and later upgrade de memory ) and works for me . -  
2	  Once again excellent service . Job well done ! I 've ordered several things from amazon and have never been disappointed . I recommend that you can buy from them with confidence .  
1	  I replaced my Belkin Wireless-B USB adapter with this one ( I am using these with a Belkin Wireless-G router ) . Big mistake - transfers are nearly twice as slow and the signal is lost intermittently . I tried to contact Linksys to address these issues by phone , waited on hold for over two hours , and was finally disconnected . I then sent a detailed e-mail to tech support describing my problems , but received no response . The Belkin-b is cheaper , faster and more reliable than this adapter , and Belkin has great tech support , if needed .  
2	  I have a 5 year old boy who loves to play computer games . Sadly , his computer is in the same room as mine and those beepings and boopings make me want to climb up the wall ; especially if I 'm trying to pay bills or write lesson plans . These headphones saved us ! They fit him perfectly and he is able to adjust the volume to his liking while all I hear is blessed silence . I highly recommend these !  
1	  I was very disappointed in this picture frame . While this frame does have a very high resolution , it has virtually NO side viewing angle . If you aren't staring at it directly face on , then it starts to get overly-bright and washed out , or overly dark and difficult to see - depending on the angle you are viewing it at . It also has difficulty choosing the correct orientation for a picture . If you edit the pictures in an image editor - like Photoshop - then it seems to get them right . But straight out of a camera it often gives you a " sideways " photo in the frame . There is also a design problem with the Compact Flash card slot . It is very finicky and if you even slightly misalign the card as you are inserting it into the frame , it can fall into the sealed back of the frame . This is VERY easy to do , and I was fortunate to be able to get my card to fall back out of the slot . But it is a design flaw that had to be apparent to any testers and easily fixed by enclosing the slot so that the card couldn't fall through . Westinghouse apparently decided that this was just something we would have to deal with . Finally , it arrived with a bright blue " dead pixel " in the center of the screen . This was not noticable on bright , " busy " pictures , but it stood out like a sore thumb on dark pictures and particularly on flesh-toned scenes - like , well - you know - people 's faces . As a comparison , I also own the Matsunichi frame which has been flawless . I expected more from a company like Westinghouse . There are better frames out there . ONE OTHER NOTE : BEWARE - if you order this through Amazon but actually purchase it through Electronics Express , you have an entirely different ( and worse ) return policy which even though the product might be defective , requires you to pay shipping and limits your returns to 15 days . Look carefully before you order - if it isn't from AMAZON then you are probably up a creek if there are problems .  
2	  This was shipped immediately and arrived very quickly . Great service . Would recommend to anyone .  
2	  Great value and nice lighting . Lens has done everything we 've hoped for including wonderful clarity and color .  
2	  Dad was downsizing from house to senior apartment and wanted to keep aspects of his 1970s component stereo , but not the big speakers . I bought these from Amazon on the basis of the reviews and we are very happy with them . They sound great with his style of music ( Glenn Miller , Sinatra , Antonio Jobim , etc ) and there is certainly enough bass . Highly recommended .  
1	  We bought this for the kitchen . After much research and waiting two weeks for it to ship from Amazon , we were very excited to open it up and get going . The first problem was apparent before we even plugged it in-no remote in the box . Then , we plugged it in and proceeded through the setup . There was a two inch green stripe running vertically down the middle of the tv . No amount of adjustment to the settings would make it go away . We had to send it back , but Amazon no longer had them . I will give it one more try from another supplier , but if it has the slightest problem , I 'm buying something else .  
2	  This is a stylish CD holder that is well constructed . The outer case supports your collection , where similar products do not . I have now ordered 6 of these and will continue to organize my collection with this product .  
2	  This works perfectly for connecting my MacBook Pro ( 2008 / 4,1 ) to my tv . There is no interference from the wi-fi or blue tooth .  
2	  for many years and no other producer of cabeling has the high quality of Monster for a VERY REASONABLE PRICE . As one reviewer pointed out , on re-sale venues like eBay / Amazon ( Amazon is not responsible for rip-off items on their site but quickly makes restitution ) , make sure you check to see that the connection " grips " are NOT plastic . There are a lot of those floating around . I 've used Monster for interconnects and speaker cables and have never had a problem . My equipment is " pricey " to say the least .  
2	  Brutally expensive in the bigger diameters , I got this 39mm for my 135mm Elmarit . Threads effortlessly and seems to work just fine . BTW if you wondered why I bothered with this I live in the mountains at 7,500 feet so I bought into the notion of the UV / IR cut . Coating seems great , haven't gotten it dirty enough to tell you if its any easier to clean then a standard filter .  
1	  Tried to install on Windows xp . Product would only occassionaly read the memory card . In the end it created 4 different drive icons . Gave up and threw it away . Purchased another brand and it worked perfectly .  
1	  It has good sound ( which is why I didn't give it one star ) but it starts at max volume every time you turn it on . This is very annoying , but I 've figure out how to deal with it . I just start it on a quite song , hold it facing the floor and begin lowering the volume immediately . Not worth the money for that inconvenience and I will never buy from them again .  
2	  If you want a sub woofer that doesn't " take over " this one 's for you . It 's size is nice and it 's sound is smooth . The only negative is that the " on / off " switch is not conveniently positioned and it is an either / or situation with this model . ( I just leave it on all the time because when there is no audio to amplify the amp is using virtually no power ) . I 'm a Yamaha fan , so I 'm biased ; but this sub fit my needs perfectly .  
2	  I am cranking out 16 ( x ) 20 prints at all focal lengths without difficult . Yes I known it in't the metal of old and if I were to fault it all it would for that fact and the lack of a tripod mount . The stabilizer is fantastic .  
1	  I 've been a radio buff for many years have a large collection and love to do compares . This unit is an Alarm Clock , not truley a " radio " . And the alarm does NOT interact with the radio , its analog , therefore it cannot turn the radio on as an alarm . Buzzer only ! It does not have a DC adaptor jack . It must run on batteries only . It has an earphone jack . No FM Stereo . If you plug headphones in you will only hear it out of one side . Sony could have easily put a mono adaptor inline so you would hear it through both and should have for the price . The tuner like many Sony products has very good sensativity . But , the controls are so small you need the hands of a brain surgeon to fine tune it . If I was travelling and intended on DXing I would NOT depend on this alarm clock . If you want to listen to SW or DX the broadcast band , buy a real radio . If you want a travel alarm clock , buy one that interacts with the radio . At this price this unit is certainly NOT WORTH IT ! I give two stars instead of one because the tuner is pretty decent , however , pass it by !  
2	  I figured since I have been buying stuff on Amazon for years based on the reviews I read here , I figured it was about time that I contributed one . I bought the MX75s based on other 's reviews here at Amazon . I 've had these about 8 months and I really like them . I have used several different types of headphones / earbuds and couldn't find any that could stand the abuse of daily workouts while not driving me crazy falling out of my ears or off my head . These things will stay in your ears . When I first saw these and people said they were secure , I thought " Yeah , right " , but they work well and they keep performing . The sound is good , when you take the time to get a good fit . It isn't going to wow you when you have 5 people pounding tread mills next to you , but you can hear your music which is an accomplishment . When in a quiet setting the sound is quite good . The kit that is provided to alter the fit is something you should hang onto even if the earphones fit well in the default setup . I found the fit changed over time and I was glad I had thrown the kit in the junk drawer . Some don't like the long cord that is provided . I must admit that it can get tangled pretty easily as there is quite a bit of wire , but I like the extra wire as it allows me to put my ipod in the pocket of my shorts when I am working out with weights . This is a major benefit for me as I am allergic to neoprene and can't have those stretch bands wrapped around my arms . These will stand up to lots of moisture . When I am done working out , my shirt is usually dripping and these headphones have not shown ANY effects from the moisture or the salt . Pretty impressive . The MX75s aren't perfect , but for the application I bought them for they work really well . I think they are well worth the money and I would buy another pair without hesitation .  
1	  I bought this mouse for my work laptop which I primarily use at my office . I was very excited about the side scrolling feature since I look at very large spreadsheets on a regular basis . What I discovered was the software that comes with the mouse conflicts with my touchpad . I talked to customer service and there doesn't seem to be a resolution to the problem . Now I am using it with my home computer and I have found that the side scrolling is a little slow to be useful . Overall the feeling , buttons , and precision are very good , but the two selling points ( side scrolling and wireless ) didn't work for me .  
2	  I use these for USB Battery Charging testing . They have the lowest contact resistance , and lowest voltage drops . You can tell the quality by the heavy guage wire and sturdy contactors .  
2	  This book is ok but I 've read better books on C Programming . If you got this and The C Programming Language by Brian W. Kernighan .. then together you 've got a good start on learning C and many of the modern tools ( such as make ) that are important to all C programmers .  
1	  I got the Vonage service just under six months ago then moved and brought my phone number with me - today there was a brief power outage - and the router did not come back . For your amusement , this is the list of stuff that Vonage wanted me to do ( Imagine , if you will , all these instructions given in an Indian accent , not unpleasant , but everything had to be repeated four times , and common idiomatic US english was not understood . 1 . unplug the router and plug it back in . 2 . Hold the reset button for 50 seconds , unplug the router and plug it back in . 3 . Plug the wall wart ( idiom ) cube ( idiom ) wire from the router to the power outlet on the linksys router to the wall power outlet into a DIFFERENT WALL SOCKET ! ( chuckle ) 4 . Reboot my Cisco router ( yeah , sure - everything else is working , I told them sure - they wanted me to disconnect the router from the T1 and the ethernet and then plug them all back together - I told them yes and ignored them , just waited a minute , this was a stupid suggestion , I had 1000 kilobits on the line both ways , and everything else was working ) . 5 . Unplug all other computers from my Cisco Router ( I simply refused on this one , it is just silly ) . Vonage wants $ 99 to replace this router - and they send it DHL , which does not work in my rural area ( why else would I have a T1 and not a DSL or Cablemodem connection ) ? But I can send the router back to them when I cancel my service and suffer no penalty , and then get a free one with free shipping from Tomatovine . Maybe theirs will work a bit better . Vonage service has deterioriated to where I would not recommend them to anyone . I did not mention that this was the third call to Vonage - the first two resulted in hangups . This router is not good - a power outage should not kill a consumer grade device like this . Power outages are common in the consumer world .  
2	  As already stated , this works fine as a replacement for the TiVo IR cable . 4 days ago I didn't even know what an IR cable was until I started trying to add a Time Warner digital cable box to my TiVo setup . When the TiVo setup program demanded that I plug in an IR cable so it could change channels on the cable box , I was surprised as hell . I 'm sure I threw my original cable away 5 years ago , not even knowing what it was . Even more surprisingly , brick & mortar electornics stores like Best Buy ( who even sells TiVos ) don't carry replacement cables . So I consulted the Googles , read about IR emitters , and found this one which I ordered with express delivery . 2 business days later my TiVo and cable box are playing well together . Basically this cable plugs into your TiVo " IR Out " jack , and you tape the other end on the front glass of the cable box where it normally picks up signals from your remote control . The TiVo setup program will run through a whole gamut of tests to make sure it can change channels on the cable box through this cable , and whammo , you can start using the TiVo remote to control everything . There IS a slight delay between pressing the TiVo remote buttons , and the cable box channel actually changing .. maybe 3-4 seconds . But that 's the price you pay for using TiVo with a cable box .  
2	  The Lowepro Ridge 30 Camera Case is just about perfect for carrying myFujifilm Finepix F70EXR 10MP Super CCD Digital Camera with 10x Optical Dual Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCDon my belt . Here are my observations : Pros - + Quality Construction ; this is a well made case + Well Padded ; the camera compartment is padded and the material will not likely scratch the finish + Roomy ; there is space for my camera , lens cleaning cloth , extra batteries , and memory cards + Smooth Zippers ; good quality zippers that allow one-handed openingCons - Outer flap protrudes a little more than I would like , but not absurdly so - Flimsy Shoulder Strap ; but I don't use it anyway so it 's not a big deal to meI really like Lowepro cases and this one is everything I have come to expect from them . Highly Recommended ! CFH  
1	  These have to be the absolute worst headphones I have ever owned . The output is extremely weak and there is zero bass . I have purchased other headphones around this price that were significantly better . I 'm surprised that Sony would put their name on this product , given how awful it is .  
1	  Player started shutting itself off just after the actual 90 day warranty period . Good sounding player for the money , but very demanding with the proprietary software . The only way to get it to work now , until my new purchase arrives , is to bang it on a table top . Then after some undetermined period , it will shut itself off again .  
1	  The battery is already dying and I 've only had it for a month . Don't buy this item . Buyer be warned .  
2	  with this product , there is a learning curve .. as with all dvd players , you have to adjust the settings for your liking .. the price of this player and the quality I get from it is amazing .. I have to agree with the reviewer who said he needed to set it up for best results .. if you are the type of person that can not figure out how to set up electronic devises , THEN READ THE MANUAL ! the hd tv I have only displays up to 1080i .. but the quality isn't very good .. that 's because it is interlaced and I am used to pro-scan .. so I receive a better picture at 720p .. so play with the settings and you 'll be happy at the price point .. and as for running it directly through your tv .. don't expect the sound from a tv channel .. IT IS A DIFFERENT SIGNAL ALL TOGETHER ! run it through your stereo for best results .. for 50 bucks you can't beat this player ..  
1	  This printer does a fine job on the photos - when it 's actually working that is . I 've had 3 of these damn things and every single one of them had the same problems . First , the paper wouldn't feed . No matter what I tried or whatever Kodak told me to do , they never lost this problem . All 3 of them did this ! . Second , the printer started to print only the top half or bottom half of the photo . Again ALL 3 DID THIS TOO ! Kodak wanted me to send it to them so they could " fix " it for $ 250 - about the price of a new unit . I refused since it would have been the same printer with the same problems . I had already done that once and that 's now one of the units that is screwed up . Now I 'm stuck with 3 packages of supplies and no printer to use them on . This is ridiculous . Kodak knew this was a problem and refused to do anything warranty wise about it . A friend of mine had the EXACT SAME PROBLEMS that I did . That 's 4 in all . To top it off , they no longer support this unit . Thanks Kodak . It 's no wonder you 're going out of business . Shame on you for hanging us with this one . One smaller problem is their software . It all to often has some kind of fit and won't " see " my camera . It usually takes some frogging around with it to get it to finally see the camera or sync with it . Updated software did nothing to help it . Sorry but I 'm inclined to think that those of you who have had no problems with this printer dock must work for Kodak .  
2	  Relying upon positive reviews that I had read here , I bought this carrying case for my new Olympus SP-570UZ . I am pleased with my purchase . The SP-570UZ does , indeed , fit perfectly in the case , and there are pockets with ample room for spare batteries , memory card , etc .  
2	  Does exactly what a person would basically need it to do - route DVI to video , probably the only item like itself in existence  
1	  The days of " 750MB " has gone . Only reason I bought this was to retrieve my archival datas stored in the 750MB cartridges . After that it is useless . It 's the time for the memory size of " GBs " and " TBs . "  
1	  Most electronics in my home are from SONY . But , this time I am so disappointed with the purchase at Sonystyle . Com . 1 ) When I opened the computer , the computer can not be started . I spend much much time to call the custom service . Unfortunately the custom service is very difficult to be reached . 2 ) It gave a lot of difficulties to return this big stuff . So I decided to send it to a SONY authorized Service Ctr . There is only 1 in Massachusetts . It needs 7 bussiness days to repair - Oh , my god ! 3 ) Rebate cheating :( .. ) . 4 ) No computer manuals , no software manuals , no recovery discs ( you need to buy it ! ) with the computer . You need to spend much time to call them for every detail . So bad service , which waste me a lot of time and feeling . I will never buy SONY again .  
1	  I love the mouse , but the reliability is just awful . My first mouse lasted about 6 months before the left click started to not register consistently . Kensington was kind enough to send me a replacement , but now the replacement is having the same problem . I love the way it feels and performs , but the quality is questionable .  
1	  PalmOne IIc ( Reconditioned ) Worked very Good for a short period . Touch pad does not respond correctly to stylus taps . Very frustrating to enter info .  
1	  The monitor has great potential for displaying high quality pictures from digital camera . It was a great experience compared with my 6 y . o . Panasonic :) Superb colors , details , contrast - everything . But nothing is perfect - the text is sharp only at the left side of the display - the rest of it is blurred and makes it hard to look at . When I switch to 1280x1024 @ 85Hz ( Recommended ) the text is too blurred to work with . The clock at the bottom right has a reddish blurre ! I 'm going to call service center and ask them if they will repair / replace the unit . If not I will lower my rating to " one star " :( If the image on the new unit will be equally sharp I will raise it to 4 or even 5 stars and add some details about tested resolutions etc .  
1	  i saw it , read about it , thought it was everything i needed . Boy , was I wrong ! This thing is .. crap ! When a song is playing , sometimes I want to switch to a new one . It 's frozen up on me 3 times ! Then , I have to wait for the battery to run out , and then recharge . It takes forever ! And every single time i recharge it , it runs out of power even faster than before . The settings are so messed up ! For some reason , all the songs kept switching around . I am the only one who messes with it . Turns out for some reason , it was put on shuffle mode ! And the radio is so hard to figure out , you have to use the manual to get it ! And the radio quality is horrible . The sound quality overall is bad too . I bought this as a congratulations for finishing middle school with money my parents gave me . Now I am paying the consequences . I am earning to buy a new iPod nano . DO NOT BUY THIS . I AM WARNING YOU ! DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER , IF YOU EVEN CALL IT THAT ! I call it .. a waste of my good money and crap .  
1	  Media code is MCC 01RG20 , which is Mitsubish Chemicals Corporation . They have an excellent reputation , which is why I was so surprised that this media is as bad as it is . I 'm using a Plextor PX-708A with the 1.08 firmware revision . The first 4X burn produced a coaster with tons of bad sectors , and visible dye damage . The second at 4X also had visible dye damage , but my recorder was able to read each sector . My Sony DVD player ( older and picky ) couldn't read it . A 2X burn produced something my DVD player could handle ( at least the title screen comes up , and the titles start playing - haven't checked playability across the entire disc ) . There 's still visible dye damage , so I 'm skeptical . Having bought this media so I could burn at 4X to produce something my DVD player will like ( have to burn at 2.4X with my + R media to achieve that ) , I 'm quite disappointed with the results .  
2	  I bought it as a used one for less than 50 $ , the battery is so good that I can used it even if not with a car . The maps can be updated to the latest for free . A really good gps , I think I will use if for years . I love it  
1	  I have an Xbox 360 black wireless controller that I use to play games for windows on my laptop . This thing absolutely will not work as a charger . I wound up getting two of them . One came with a debunked battery that doesn't work . Neither of them will light up the red charge led on the controller . I have been able to play with one of them plugged in , but that kind of defeats the purpose of buying a wireless controller . Before you ask , yes I do have the Microsoft wireless receiver for windows , and my controler and batery do work with my friends play and charge kit .  
1	  Epson Stylus 1160 - I rated this a 2 because it does produce beautiful output WHEN it is working . Otherwise it deserves 0 ! Over the last year I have used many $ print cartridges just trying to get ink to flow through the print head . After a little more than a year the printer is completely dead and print head replacement is more expensive than a new printer ! My 5 year old Alps works and family members have a 6 year old Canon and 3 year old HP which still work great . In trying to figure out how to fix the Epson my research indicates that problems with Epson ink jet printers are common .  
1	  I won't just call this printer a rip-off and walk away . No I think there is something more sinister afoot that needs to be addressed head-on . You see , I noticed the ink cartridges that came with my printer went empty almost immediately . I 'm talking after only having printed between 40 or 50 pages TOPS . So I thought since they were " freebie " cartridges they weren't filled all the way up . Surely when I purchased new cartridges the ink would last much much longer . WRONG ! I didn't print more than about 50 pages again before the black started getting a warning signal that it was going empty . NOW I was getting ticked . I had JUST paid an outrageous $ 80 for the ink cartridges and they were already going empty . There was NO WAY I was going to buy another set of cartridges for this printer so I went back to using my old printer . However I still needed to use the Canon MP530 to do scanning because the old one wouldn't scan with my Mac . Or so I thought . I later downloaded updated software that made scanning possible . Since the black cartridge was not quite empty I thought the scanner would keep working as long as I never printed . WRONG AGAIN ! I was able scan about two times . The third time the black cartridge had gone empty and now NOTHING would work . The other cartridges also started showing up as empty as well . I looked and the cartridges ARE empty . So HOW exactly were the ink cartridges going empty if I wasn't printing ? There are two possible explanations . One , every time you turn the printer on and off it could be spending ink doing a " cleaning " . Two , the ink could be evaporating . My guess is it 's both . With both sets of cartridges ALL the cartridges have gone empty about the same time . I estimate I paid about $ 1.60 a page for the amount of printing I did with the second set of cartridges . THAT 'S AN OUTRAGE ! Looking at the negative reviews I can see I 'm not the only one having this problem . And by the way lets be clear about something . I mentioned I went back to using my old printer . I 'm not going to mention which one . But I will say that printer sat for awhile before I went back to using it . I don't print frequently so we 're talking about a year before I went back to using the old standby . And the ink cartridges had been used a quite a bit before I stopped using it-easily over 100 pages . But when I went back to using the old standby the ink had NOT evaporated . I 've done a fair amount of printing with those SAME old ink cartridges since I started using that printer again . Between 35 and 50 pages I would guess-maybe more . The black is getting low but they are STILL not empty . The important thing I want to note is the cartridges on my old printer are a FRACTION the size of the Canon printer 's cartridges . You 'd think the Canon cartridges would last 5 times longer . As far as I 'm concerned the Canon ink cartridges for the MP530 printer are specifically and purposely design to go empty at an absurdly fast rate-even if you leave it sitting . It should be illegal for Canon to do that . At a BARE minimum there needs to be a consumer fraud investigation opened regarding the excessive use of ink on these printers . These printers really need to just be pulled from the market . In addition it would be nice if a class action suit were opened so that those of us who were burned buying this printer can recover some of our money . On a more personal level I 'd very much like to see the people responsible for putting this printer on the market tarred and feathered and the whole affair posted on Youtube . In lieu of that it would do my heart good to see them working in the mailroom or cleaning toilets .  
2	  This camera came out in 2007 and was priced at $ 479.99 at the Sony store where I bought it . So unless WSP is including a lot of extras , the $ 999 price seems wrong . This camera is now discontinued and there are newer versions of this camera . Check out dpreview for latest cameras . I have used it quite a bit ( > 4,000 pictures ) and gotten great results with the camera . Although not a pocket camera its small enough to take it on trips and not be burdened by a heavy DSLR . As with all small sensor cameras low light quality is degraded but as long as you understand this limitation and have adequate light you can get very good pictures from this camera . It 's fun to use and has a very nice macro capability . it has a great zoom range although todays models have even greater range .  
1	  This dvd player is simply terrible . The picture is choppy , the remote stops working after a couple weeks and then a month down the road the player is toast . Spend a little extra cash and find a player that will last you , if you like blowing money you can always just send some my way .  
1	  Received this keyboard today and was very dissapointed . I can't believe IBM actually allowed Micro Innovations to put their logo on this item . When typing , the keystrokes either were not recognized or would display seconds later . Receiver " data " light blinks showing that are you pressing keys , however , the keystrokes are not sent to the computer . Returning item now as I type on a good / working LOGITECH wireless RF keyboard .  
2	  I just recently bought this speaker speaker system and have not a single bad thing to say about it . I tend to believe many of the problems reported are software problems that reviewers don't know about . As , once I bought this , I found some settings I didn't even know about and had to change them for the best listening . Anyway , about the speakers themselves , they rock . I 'm a huge music lover . After reading some reviews , I read these speakers only sound good on true 5.1 such as DVDs . Simply not true . These speakers play normal music perfectly . After fine tuning my software settings , I found the sweet spot and it sounds great . The subwoofer has great bass . I 'm a bass fanatic and this fills all my needs . However , for certain songs , when bass isn't required , for example , I listen to Bach . The bass can be also turned off for very clear listening . However , when listening to bass tests with the bass maxed out the woofer kicks like you wouldn't believe . I would recommend these speakers to anyone !  
1	  After panning these things on sound quality - I realized I left out another important factor . The cord is very poorly designed . As I mentioned in my earlier review , I use the iRiver HP140 . This device comes with a remote ( which is awesome ) . I figured that the " short " cord everybody was talking about would be great for me , because I have a device with a remote and don't need a few extra feet of cord hanging around since the remote stays relatively close to me , even when the unit is in my backpack or jacket . Just one problem . There isn't even enough cord to reach your belt region . I don't know how other people use the remote - but I usually clip mine to my pants right at the waist-line . The cord just misses your waist-line . If you stand perfectly still , you can probably pull it off - but if you begin to walk or even turn your body slightly - you will yank the ear-buds out of your ears . I suppose there are two options : 1 . Use the cord extension supplied ( but this will surely give you WAY too much cord if you are using a remote like I am and only need to reach your waist-line ) . 2 . - clip the remote onto an area of your body above your waist-line . I did this for a day while I was wearing a jacket which had an inside breast pocket . But - the next day I was wearing a tee-shirt and no jacket . What are you supposed to do - clip the remote to your neck ? 6 extra inches would have made all the difference and allowed people to use the " short " cord ( without the extension ) to reach their belt-line - which is where I 'm assuming most people clip their remotes - right ? Poorly done Sony .  
1	  The radio was really well built and looked great . However it could not hold a station and was pretty useless as a radio .  
1	  This was one of the worst cams I have ever purchased since learned my lesson going to save up for one of those digital handheld camcorders instead with better resolution and megapixels . This was aweful the picture was grainy horrible experience wouldn't buy another . I use them mostly to do my expotv product reviews this wasn't working for what I wanted it for . So I am saving up to someday get a aiptek digital handheld camcorder or one of those flip ones instead . this is okay maybe for yahoo messenger if that . I definitly like my Creative Live one better . My other logitech which was the quick cam im messenger or something the gray one my boyfriend gave me worked alot better had better resolution this one wouldn't recommend it get what you pay for kind of a thing .  
1	  The speakers provide a tinny sound and if used in a car , electrical interference . Add to this that if they aren't plugged-in , you 'll require 4-AA batteries , not included . You get exactly what you pay for with these speakers - maybe even less . I was reminded of the speakers in the very early transistor radios .  
2	  Below is a reposted review originally published on the page detailing this model in the yellow color ASIN : B00065HM1YI ordered the " yellow " model here .. and found several " surprises " . The Grundig ( now Eton ) FR-200 is a small " auxiliary " AM-FM portable which adds general shortwave radio coverage , an LED flashlight , and a three-way power design that allows for a quick " pick-me-up " to a replaceable and inexpensive rechargeable NiMH battery pack similar to one used in the typical cordless phone . A few minutes of cranking , ` n you 're back in broadcast business . With these options , it 's virtually impossible for this radio to not find " juice " . The FR-200 is imported by Eton from Tecsun in mainland China , and is marketed exclusively as an " emergency radio " .. but I 'm thinking - " perfect for the canoe and camping trip " where one wouldn't wish to lose something more costly to the elements . The reviews on this product have run the course-from favorable-to horrible . This would clearly indicate either a serious quality control problem .. a lack of reviewer perspective on just WHAT objective this product was designed to meet .. or both . After pondering this unique little $ 40 radio for over two years , I finally unwrapped and evaluated one ( the package exterior said " yellow " -a neon-orange model waited inside ) . The FR-200 is less than HALF THE COST of its most-similar alternative-the Freeplay Summit ( which I have ordered-and twice returned because of substandard performance ) , so I was somewhat skeptical of this product format . Upon closer examination and use , the less-expensive Grundig ( while not brimming with " digital glitz " and rows of small silver buttons ) is higher in overall performance , easier to pack and carry , and much more " disposable " should that situation arise . My prior skepticism has turned into consumer gratification . This product is satisfying , useful , and an unquestionable value . Here are my performance observations .. AUDIO QUALITY : The sound of the FR-200 is crisp , clear , and natural . While far from " room shaking " - this unit is fine as a close-in companion ; and more-than-adequate for its intended purpose as a standby " blackout radio " , or convenient portable " sidekick " at home , in camp , or out on the water . RECEPTION ON FM : The worst goes first .. The FM capabilities of the FR-200 are sad to barely acceptable , depending on your listening location . In a small community , ANY nearby local station with brawny signal strength will overload the circuits in this radio to a point that renders it nearly useless-unless you enjoy the offending local station , which will populate itself on nearly the entire FM dial-crowding out even not-so-distant stations from out-of-town . In an urban area , with many powerful " close-in " signals , the FM band becomes a jumbled and distorted mess where " ONLY the strong survive " - but barely ! Interestingly , out in fringe areas , where brutish FM signals are few and far in-between , the band shows signs of intelligible life .. a plus for rural listening ! RECEPTION ON AM : Other than a few expensive " AM niche " and world-band receivers , the FR-200 is possibly one of THE BEST portable AM radios you can own ! Sensitivity , selectivity ( in the absence of a strong local station ) , and recovered audio quality are OUTSTANDING ! NEVER have I seen a radio in this class ( and several other classes for that matter ) that provides as rich an AM listening experience . During the daytime , even very distant AM signals are intelligible and less-assailed by the all-to-familiar " circuit noise " that hinders weak AM station listening on most radios . Sensitivity remains consistent from the low ( 530 kHz ) to the high ( 1700 kHz ) end of the band-NOT typical for an AM receiver section in a radio at this price point . Right " out of the box " my FR-200 easily caught , and faithfully reproduced in early afternoon , six AM stations from Chicago-over 250 miles from my location . At night , this radio becomes a pint-sized DX-delight . Virtually EVERY channel is " alive " , yet moderate-to-strong signals remain " separated " and fully intelligible . In the rare occasion that you may find , and choose to listen to , an AM station with a music format-you will find a hint of " hi-fi " in the reproduced audio . This level of AM performance is usually the domain of the " CC Radios " of the market ; and at less than one-quarter of their cost-the FR-200 is an " AM standout " . Here 's another possible application : Your FR-200 's headphone jack + a patch cord + the line input on your surround-sound = FAR BETTER AM reception and audio on that system . RECEPTION ON SHORT WAVE : Plainly put-it is " pedestrian " at best . If you 're shopping for shortwave agility-continue your search . Nor do I recommend this radio as an entry into " the world of shortwave " , either . The SW feature on this product is obviously a " convenience item " - which turns out to be operationally inconvenient at times . The technical idiosyncrasies of that band are such that the ability to optimally receive it demands a product design with a distinct focus . Interestingly , Eton-Grundig is a " shortwave company " that DOES NOT market the FR-200 as a " shortwave radio " .. It merely " includes " that feature . THE GOOD ON SW : Prominent domestic and international broadcasters with big signals WILL find their way to your tiny FR-200 , and strong stations can sound fairly good on this radio . In early afternoon ( NOT a preferable SW listening day-part ) , I found the higher band ( " SW-2 " ) to be fairly-populated , and I was able to receive tiny 1000-watt CFRX Toronto , Canada here in the Midwest on the lower ( inactive-by-day ) " SW-1 " band-a " catch " typical for a more-expensive rig designed for SWL . At night , on the active lower frequencies ( " SW-1 " ) , reception is generally decent with the built-in telescoping rod antenna , and can be improved with a " roll-up alligator-clip " wire antenna ( $ 15 at " The Shack " ) . Unlike many small SW radios , the FR-200 can tune well below 49-meters ( 6 MHz ) .. even down to 90-meters ( 3 MHz ) where several obscure domestic and western-hemisphere stations live by night . The laws of physics-and the laws of " affordable design " generally work to inhibit easy reception on these channels ( if available ) on low-cost SW radios . My FR-200 did an admirable job of snagging several of these signals with only its included antenna . THE NOT-SO-GOOD ON SW : Little is gained thru a decent receiver design if the user can't find or identify a desired station . Imagine tuning a radio with your eyes closed . That would describe the experience of hunting for a SW station on the FR-200 solely based on frequency info . Three design factors ( I should say ) - design compromises make this radio a chore to tune overall-and nearly impossible to " direct tune " on shortwave . ( 1 ) This receiver 's " single-conversion " RF design permits strong signals to repopulate themselves on an additional frequency-causing interference to other stations and confusion for the user . ( 2 ) Nearly the entire shortwave service is " squeezed " into two " bands " that occupy a minimal 1.75-inches of band-spread . Now that 's " touchy tight " , especially when you consider that .. ( 3 ) This unit 's manual slide-rule tuning ( coarse and fine ) is " mushy " , and the numerical frequency layout is poorly calibrated . IN SUMMARY : What we have here is a nearly-charming , color-coordinated campsite or canoe companion that can't come up short on " juice " - but CAN provide acceptable sound and outstanding AM radio reception in the middle of nowhere . A demure radio that throws in a nice bright tent-filling LED light so you can try to find that hyper-paranoid " end of the world " shortwave talk show host to go with your adult beverages around the campfire . Even this radio 's dismal FM reception might be mitigated by the location you tote it to , but I wouldn't bet on finding your favorite Jazz-Fest on " Wilderness 98.1 " , so few points are lost ! There are more-expensive products in this class that do NO better job-and cheaper offerings that do NO job at all . Finally , if a bear tries to eat your trusty FR-200 .. or the canoe it 's in capsizes-just find another forty bucks and start all over with a different color ! I plan to keep mine .. I 'm getting fond of Neon-Orange .  
2	  Worked Great in my printer and lasted for quite along time . I have always purchased Brand Name Cartridges because they work better than the generic ones .  
1	  My daugter loves this toy but it won't work on the computer . But , she just loves the music . She just downloaded Baby , come back to me and say ok from Vannesa 's hudgens music . she loves it !  
2	  This is great ! I kept it on its base when I wasn't using it as per its instructions and it had excellent heat and ironed beautifully . The water holder gave me plenty of steam and I didn't have to refill it for the ironing I did . The best part , of course , was the ease of using the iron without the cord . Wonderful ! I can never go back to an iron with a cord .  
2	  The door lock actuator is a tenth the price from Ford , not very hard to install , not plug in , but not hard . Works . Even if it only last one or two years it 's still a good deal . Just test to figure out which wire goes where and be willing to drill mounting holes ( unseen ) in the inside of the door . Don't even have to take the old unit out . Used on a 99 F250  
1	  The HP Scanjet 5590 failed to work with YEP , a reputable , easy-to-use Filing Software . It worked fairly well as a stand alone ; very slow , but it did the job . Research the product thoroughly to make sure it will meet your expectations . Also , a word of warning when buying from a vendor called Galactics . Make sure you read and understand their return provisions and regulations , to avoid deplorable results , as I did , if the product fails to operate . Printers scanners and electronic products ARE NOT RETURNABLE .  
2	  I ordered this item on March 22 , but not shipped until today ( April 27 ) , why ?  
2	  I got this for Christmas 3-4 yrs ago , and I didn't have one problem with it until last week when the power chip thing got fried . ( I 'm guessing we had a power surge and as it was not grounded , the power thing fried .. ) I tried 2 other dvd players since then and do not like them and am now trying to get another one of these .  
2	  I originally thought this one played videos too , but my daughter loves it . She has all her favorite songs and family pics and podcasts . It was so easy to use we didn't even need directions .  
2	  I am very happy with the product . The service was great ! I will definately order again . Thank you for a great buying experience .  
2	  Yeah , it 's kind of noisy & sort of slow , but a good deal for the price . Easy to set up & easy to use & produces a printed page that looks very professional - you won't be embarassed to turn in a report to the boss or teacher . It could get tedious for long reports but for it manages print queues well . It has separate cartridges for black and color and changing them is simple ..  
2	  I use my USB hub every day and it works fine with every device I plug into it .  
2	  This computer is FAAST . Fast is the only way to describe it . Having TWO G4 processors at 867 MHZ makes this machine absolutely scream through all of the tasks I can put it through . Since OS X takes advantage of both processors as well as the velocity " Altivec " engine , all system tasks are completed instantaneously . Now that more and more applications are being released for OS X , there is no need to boot into OS 9 ( although it is still possible ) . OS X is the future of computing . A Rock solid UNIX foundation ensures that your computer will virtually never crash . I have had mine for almost two months , and the system has never crashed on me . Apps ( Internet explorer , for one ) have crashed before but it doesn't cause a full fledged system lockup . The one thing that you will need to do is buy an extra 512 MB of RAM . In this case , you need PC2100 DDR RAM ( 266MHz ) . The graphics performance of this machine is also quite impressive . I personally bought the Radeon 9000 Pro with my machine but this particular model comes stock with the GeForce 4 MX . This card is good for current games ( Q3 , RTCW , Medal of Honor , Warcraft 3 ) , but the lack of shaders and advanced Anti Aliasing capability mean that games like Doom 3 will struggle to play smoothly . The Specs listed on Amazon 's page are a little misleading . It says , for instance that the machine comes with 1 MB of L2 cache , when in fact it comes with 1 MB of L3 cache as well as 256k L2 cache . the L3 cache really adds an extra kick to the processors ability to crunch information without having to access the RAM or the hard drive . Also , it says the machine is not 3d capable . Huh ? I believe the fact that it has a 3d card makes it quite capable . Amazon 's specs for the combo drive are also incorrect . the CD-RW part of the combo drive can write at 16x and rewrite at 10x . Anyway , from my own experience , this is a wonderful machine that has it waiting for me more than me waiting for it . Highly recommended .  
2	  When I was searching for info on DVD players I found a few reviews on other web-sites from consumers who had this DVD player and complained that it skipped . Therefore , I bought it with the understanding that it might not met my needs . It has performed wodnerfully . I have not experienced any skipping or other problems with the player . With that said it is a very basic DVD player . There aren't any fancy frills on it , but I wasn't really looking for any . I wanted something that was easy to use , had a component video and audio output , and would do a reliable job of playing my favorite movies . The 621 does that at a price that I liked .  
2	  Works great , especially having a " stand by " switch when you want to deactivate the modem and not unplug it . Running XP on a home wireless network .  
2	  .. it can be easily and safely removed using a cloth dampened with either carbon tetrachloride or benzene . Rub it gently and it comes right off leaving the leather unmarked and undamaged . This is the perfect case for the ELPH series of Canon digicams from the S100 right up through the S400 . I have had one for about 3 years now and they are hard to get ! They were originally made for the Canon ELPH Jr. APS camera but stretch out just enough for the ELPH Sdigitals . If anyone knows where they are available ( currently unavailable here on amazon . com ) please let me know at prudhocjATolypenDAWTcom ! I would like another one .  
2	  I originally bought a pair of these about three or four years ago for using in recording me talking in a podcast . It was with three other people and my voice always ended up the clearest out of all of them so I was always happy with it . Before I bought this , I had a lot of issues of ambient noise coming through no matter what I tried . Once I started using this , I NEVER had another issue with ambient noise again . I used it for that for about a year and a half and never had any issues at all . During that time , my husband needed a new gaming headset . Since I was so happy with this , I got him another one of these and he used it daily ( to my weekly ) . It was good for him while it worked . After about two years , it started having issues with the microphone connection and so I gave him mine to use instead . That one now is starting to have some crackling issues ( after four years of use ) so we 're in the market for a new one . I think for the money and the great use we got out of it , I am very happy with these . They were definitely the best we 'd ever used and I 'm sad to see them go .  
1	  We use many Cisco / Linksys RV series routers - and this RVS4000 v2 was disappointing . I 'd recommend the RV042 - solid as a rock in my experience . Configuring the device is painful because it insists on rebooting so frequently . But you can live with that .. its only the first day or so . But the device would often drop the VPN connection and require a reboot in order to reestablish . And every so often , the soft reboot would not work .. requiring someone to physically visit the device a unplug it ! Even non VPN traffic had a habit of failing on downloads of large files . Sort of as if MTU might be wrong .. maybe , but not every time . Totally unacceptable . Tempting to blame the WAN provider instead of the router , right ? But no problems when this device was replaced with an RV042 . ( This just in .. there is new firmware available in Jun 2011 .. but I 'm not in the mood to replace a stable RV042 just to see if the new firmware , primarily with Japanese language support , fixes any of the above issues . )  
1	  Having an ever-growing DVD / TV collection I was looking for something to get them out of a stack in the corner . Purchased this item and it was easy to assemble and looked quite nice , and it didn't take up a whole lot of room as it was quite tall . However within a month the plastic diamond sides completely snapped down one side rendering it 100 % unusable and unfixable !  
2	  An excellent starter HDTV . It is not what one would describe as a " big screen TV " but for those of us who don't want a giant appliance in their living room , this Toshiba takes up very little space and delivers a great picture . Just know that if you don't have HD cable or satellite , it isn't going to look much different from your old set ( aside from the aspect ratio ) . Still , we all know that soon all TV will be in high definition , and regular non-HD TVs will be irrelevent . This is a good transition TV because it will keep up with technology , and it won't cost that much more than a regular TV ( at least on amazon . com ) . I give it 5 stars not because it is the best HDTV , but because for what it is , a low-priced transition TV , it is excellent .  
2	  This bag is a perfect solution for a carry bag for my SX30IS digital camera . Enough room for camera , strap , hood . I really like the velcro closure option . Great price makes this a high value purchase . Seems well made and I like the design .  
1	  Although I didn't spend a whole lot of time researching different portable CD players , I did look around at different features and , of course , prices . Sony had a reputation that I liked , as well as a car kit package with a nifty little remote so I didn't have to search for buttons while driving . The price was reasonable so I bought it . I have been extremely dissapointed in my decision . The CD player skips . Often . I called Sony because it was still under warrenty and they advised me to ship it to them since no one in my area ( or state ) can service it . So I pay to have it shipped and 3-and-a-half weeks later it is returned to me with a note that they replaced the motor drive . It still skips . Unfortunately , it is no longer under warrenty . If I want it fixed , I can pay to have it shipped back to them and pay to service what is obviously a defective player . Overall , I am even more frustrated with the service than I am with the CD player . I will think twice before buying any Sony product let alone another CD player from them .  
1	  These relays are NOT 5 pin relays . The connector is 5 wire but the relay attached to it is only 4 pin . Now I know why others are having issues connecting these up . It 's probably a waste to return these items . This vendor is getting away with false advertising and probably not getting many return due to the low cost . They have complaints on other sites as well .  
1	  As a commuter I needed a set of good noise canceling earbuds ( cover subway sounds ) . The CX300-B are above average at canceling noise , but unfortunately they create noise whenever the cord touches anything . I 'm not sure how anyone could rate them high , as the cord noise is ridiculous and irritating . I found the Klipsch Image S4 to be a superb set , with great noise canceling , and high audio quality . Spend the extra money to get a quality product the first time around , so you don't end up wasting money on the CX300-B .  
1	  I purchased this product after having bought a Samsung 24 inch LCD monitor for my computer . The monitor is terrific ; love it ; no problems after almost two months . However , the LCD TV is a totally different ballgame . Out of the box the picture quality was terrible . The color was completely off and the image was extremely blurry . I fiddled with the thing for a week and finally returned it , totally disgusted . I never could get the color adjusted properly , and I tried ALL the controls , even the advanced ones , went back to default many times and started over ( which got it back to the way it was when I first set it up ) . If I got one channel to the point where the color was tolerable , the rest of the channels were unchanged or worse . And the blurry image was just as bad . Even when I increased the sharpness control to 100 % it was still blurry . My 25 + year old Sampo CRT TV was sharper and had perfect color and I switched back to that and sent the Samsung one back . I then bought a Toshiba CRT 23 inch TV and it worked perfectly out of the box - perfect color ( I 'm an artist and I do know color ) and the picture was crystal clear , no blurry images at all . Samsung should stick to computer monitors if this is an example of their LCD TVs ! ( Or maybe I got really lucky with their computer monitor ? ! )  
2	  LOVE THIS CAMERA ! Great price through Amazon and very fast shipping ( 3 business days without exediting shipping ) . Love the wide angle lens and ease of operation . The automatic features are amazing . For example , even takes great pictures out of a bus window while moving . Also love the IS - image stabilization . Takes great pictures and movies in low light .  
1	  Bought IPOD 15GB for my daughter . After 2 months the LCD cracked without any accidental injury to the unit . Apple refuses to provide service under warranty claiming the damage could not possibly be due to defect . They will repair it for $ 250 which coincidentally is the price of a new unit . Based on this " superior " customer support , I would advise against buying any Apple product .  
1	  The tape does not fit in it - and , if it does , it is too difficult to get the tape to fit .  
2	  Very nice product , easy to setup , and stylish . Some complaints about adjusting volume are valid but with persistence and holding tightly , the adjustment works fine . Highly recommended , nice looks , great sound .  
2	  My husband and I bought this TV a little over 5 months ago and it fantastic . The picture is crisp and clean . No dead pixels . No glare problems . Easy to hang on the wall with a standard wall mount . We didn't expect anything from the Ambilight feature , but I must admit it makes watching TV easier on your eyes . It can be turned off if you do not like it . There are plenty of inputs for your gaming systems , etc . PS3 games and Blu-ray both look outstanding .  
2	  As you progress through the learning curve and re-coordinate your reflexes , the TrackMan Wheel becomes very ergonomically friendly to use . The ball movement is extremely smooth . If the " Web Wheel " menu option is selected , a convenient navigation dial is displayed when the scroll wheel is depressed . The response to rapid scroll wheel movements is normal , but the response to paused 1-click movements is sporadic . The most recent driver download , selecting different menu options , and trying both USB and PS / 2 port connections failed to correct this very minor flaw . A full one second pause between 1-click wheel movements is required for a uniform response . 12-24-02 Update : A recent download from the Logitech website ( 9.75 build 302 ) has eliminated the 1-click scroll wheel hesitation with Windows XP . It would be VERY awkward to go back to a conventional optical or ball mouse . Upgraded rating from 4 to 5 stars .  
2	  I 've been in search of a perfect set of in-ear earphones for iPod . I 've purchased different earphones and tried many , and this V-Moda Bass Freq comes in at " pretty good " for the price . First thing you 'll notice with these earphones is that the cord attached to these earbuds are super thin , though highly flexible . If you 're like me who use ( and abuse ) the earphones everyday , you may worry about its durability . I have not used these for more than a month so far , so time will tell .. The sound quality is better than average of what you can find in this price range . As the name suggests , and many of the other reviewers had stated that these earphones give you a lot of bass . A LOT ! If you like a lot of bass these earphones would be perfect for you . For me , it 's a little too much . Some music gets drowned in bass although the earphones are giving you fairly good mids and highs . I had to use equalizer to tone down the bass .. I own a pair of very high-end earbuds from Shure , and if you compare the sound from Shure to V-Moda , you can tell all that bass from V-Moda is very unbalanced . I do have Apple 's " In-Ear Headphones " , and I must say they have much better balance ( though I don't recommend Apple 's at all ) than V-Moda . For example , if you listen to pop or hip-hop music a lot , V-Moda may be good for it , but if you listen to folk or guitar-heavy rock , or even classic ( a lot of acoustic instrument ) you may find V-Moda to be too bass-heavy or even find the sound to be muddy . As an alternative ( if you aren't looking for too much base ) , so far in my quest to find the perfect set of ipod earphones , I likeSony Mdr-Ex75 / Blk Ex Earbuds Headphones with 9Mm Hi-Sensitivity Driver ( Black ) for the price , and all around sound quality . They 're in-ear type to block outside noise , and they 're comfortable wearing ( and so is V-Moda , by the way ) . Very good balance overall in bass , mids , and highs , and very clear sounding . They 're also pretty sturdy too , unlike the super thin V-Moda cords .. I have tried Bose TriPort but I cannot justify their high price tag .. Sony sounds better imho .  
2	  My iPod battery would not hold a charge after less than 1 year .. but I have the 6 GB mini and didn't want to get a new nano for 200 dollars and 2 GB .. so I got this little guy and decided to do it myself . This process is not for the tech faint of heart .. but if you 've ever opened your computer to replace a hard drive , install a DVD drive or upgrade memory , it 's pretty easy . THE ONLY ISSUE I HAD was opening the top and bottom of my iPod . They 're not meant to do this , so I scuffed mine up a bit with the metal tool that wedges between the plastic piece and the case while trying to pry it off . Once that 's done , though , the rest is a breeze . Now I 'm kind of mad at Apple , though , because they should have made iPods easier to open and replace the battery ! Bottom line : Saved a bunch of money and kept my big storage factor too !  
1	  * WARNING * DO NOT BUY THIS VCR / DVD * WARNINGThis stuff is total garbage . Looks like I will eat the cost of this , however its not too late to save yourself . Buy ANYTHING else . I am on the second unit that does not and has not worked at all . GO-VIDEO SUCKS . Are they still in buisiness ? Easily the worst electronics I have ever had the misfortune of buying . It has now locked me out of my TV . I rue the day and you will too , if you buy this horrible equipment  
2	  I have the non-IS version of this lens , so I can't and won't comment on that feature . But the glass is superb . I 've taken probably 5 of my 10 or so best shots ever with this lens . I shoot sports and some other stuff . I had several " news " item shots with this lens published in various newspapers . It is a good all around lens , and makes a great combiniation with Canon 's 28-70 L ( or 24-70 ) . As far as sports , I shot a lot of basketball without lights in poorly lit gyms , and this lens coupled with good film came through . I 've recently gone SLR digital and only used this lens outdoors , but I liked the results ( I do have some digital camera tweaking to do ! ) . A couple of things about use . First , its better if you use a mono / tri-pod . On rare occassions do I use this without a monopod . It certainly isn't the heaviest lens in the world , but the pod adds more stability to your setup . If you don't use a pod , you 'll need to carry your setup by carrying the lens to minimize potential damage to the camera mount . Note that this applies to all EOS film cameras , the Digital Rebel series and the non-1D line . The 1D line of cameras are so heavy , you can probably get away with carrying the body only , but check that . I don't own a 1D ( _ ) and would use a pod with one anyway . The IS feature gives you the ability to shoot without a pod , certainly , but still support the lens on the camera when shooting as such . Since I don't have the IS feature on my lens , my pod comments relate to weight only . I 've heard someone actually say a pod is counterproductive to IS lenses ; since I don't own any IS glass , I can't comment . Check other reviews or do your own research if you think that will be an issue . The lens includes a mounting bracket that can easily rotate for portrait orientation shots . Most of my sports work is done this way . The auto / manual focus is easy to get to , and I 'd always be aware of how it is set and shoot accordingly . I go manual focus a lot , depending on the body I 'm shooting with , and its easy to work with . But you will find some of the fastest autofocus you 've ever seen with this lens , even on an early ' 90s film EOS body . One of my film bodies is a EOS 10S and , coupled with this lens , the autofocus speed was light years ahead of a late ' 90s production Nikon N90s with the " new " Nikon 80-200 lens . This lens belongs in every Pro 's and advanced amatuer 's bag .  
1	  I have gone through a few digital cameras . My first was a Kodak . It took great pictures but was too big to just stick in my pocket . My next purchase was an Olympus . It was very compact with great feautres but took TERRIBLE pictures . Then I purchased the Sony DSCW90B . I like the size , but that is about it . 90 % of the pictures I take do not come out well at all . Also , the lag time between pictures seems to be forever . It is way too slow to capture small children playing and wildlife . Since I purchased it a few months ago , I am stuck .  
1	  Battery does not work - worst Nikon battery I 've ever had if it is a & # 34 ; genuine & # 34 ; Nikon . Put in camera - showed it was dead . I charged it fully . When I turned camera on I took 2 pictures - viewed them & it was dead again . Tried to charge again & it simply will not work .  
1	  ordered a Samsung HT-X40 and it played a DVD for 10 minutes over an HDmi cable to my Samsung 46 inch LCD then the video went BLANK . return the first unit and ordered a SECOND Samsung HT-X40 and it played a DVD for 5 minutes over an HDmi cable to my Samsung 46 inch LCD then the video went BLANK . returned the second unit for a refund . still looking for a reasonable priced DVD Home Theater System that WORKS .  
1	  I bought a hundred , at KMart , for a project that needed done . So I spent the few bux more to buy Sony CD-R 's . I 'm getting a 30 % failure rate . So I hunted around ( spending more and more of my time here .. ) and got ahold of sony per the 800 number . Their position ? ( Other than that fact that the very first thing on their tape is not ' welcome to Sony ' it 's ' If you 've had a failure with A , press one , if you 've had a failure with B , press two , etc ' ) That I should package up and ship my four boxes of Sony off to some PO Box , at MY EXPENSE , and they 'll replace them . Sheesh . Why didn't I just buy Verbatim CD-R 's ( Ive had no problem with those ) or what ever the cheapie brand might be at one of the big chains ( Ive had no problem with those , either ) . So if you 're looking for media , don't shop Kmart , and don't shop Sony . Happy holidays , everyone .  
2	  Despite the negative reviews I 've read , I bought this backpack anyway to see for myself . Yes , the zippers could have been more robust , but they work ok and with the little strap mod mentioned previously from another reviewer , I feel secure that my 40D Canon won't fall out the top . I have it filled with two DSLR 's , three lens , flash unit , and other accessories . I 'll update this review later after I put this backpack through some work . Update July 13 , 2009 . Still working for me . Zippers still intact ! This bag works for me !  
2	  I bought the original oppo 971H a few months after it came out , and discovered its nice picture quality . After more than a year of owning the 971H I am still very happy with the purchase . When it 's time to upgrade my bedroom TV , I am happy to see that oppo has a new model DV-970HD coming out . With my previous good experience with oppo I did not hesitate to purchase this one even though I could not find many reviews . Connected to my bedroom TV ( a 26 " Sharp LCD ) and a set of small but nice Logitec speakers , this setup is relatively inexpensive yet delivers great picture and sound . For late night movie watching or music listening , the 970HD does a very good job . Pictures are sharp and vivid , and sound is deep and clear even with the small Logitec speakers . Popping in my favorite SACD , the surround sound creates a relaxing and romantic environment for the night . For me , oppo just made another good player at a very reasonable price .  
1	  This is a great case , however , even with the top removed , the IIc will not fit into the case . Had to return the case . Worthless .  
2	  The quality of the pictures is great . But you need to remember to enhance details on the settings when you print , while this will take on more ink , that is ok , the quality is perfect . Colors are bright and exact , while printing RGB format . It feels like the pictures are clone from the screen . I recomend this product to anybody that needs to create their own family album and not wait until the store developers have it ready . Also for postcards and invitations , where you dont want large quantities .  
1	  Product worked for less than a month before left ear bud shorted out . Poor quality .  
1	  There is an error on this item . The picture you get of this item DOES NOT match the picture on the product page . The one on the search page looks much nicer .  
2	  Well i was searching for a keyboard online for a [ less expensive ] used price . And i found one . I was not specifically looking for a microsoft one , but i was hoping on getting it , and well i got it . When i was looking for more info on the keyboard i noticed that i couldnt get much info , especially what are the buttons functions , so I am going to tell you it . There are 19 buttons which do activity 's . The activity 's are or as microsoft calls it the Hot Keys are Back , Forward , Stop , Refresh , Search , Favorites , Web / Home , Mail , Mute , Decrease Volume , Increase Volume , Play / Pause , Stop , Prev Track , Next Track , and Media ( lists all entertainment type programs such as real player , winamp , cd player etc . ) , My computer , Calculator , and Sleep . I found that the only buttons you can change the activity with is the mail button , calculator button , my computer button , and search so far . The detachable palm rest is not comfortable as my other palm rest so i dont use it . The keyboard lists keyboard shortcuts on the side of the corresponding keys such as if you were trying to copy a word you would press cntrl + c , and on the side view of c you could see it says copy . The keyboard comes with PS / 2 and USB cable joint together . The keyboard has a built in 2 usb ports . The keyboard allows you to disable some keys , if you wish to . Well I liked the keyboard , and i bought a used one , and found a great price for it too ..  
2	  The cable works perfectly and was obviously professionally made . They worked great for bridging our LIU to our switch across the wall at gigabit speeds , and I would expect much higher if necessary . The price seems to have gone way up since I bought it however , making it not as great of a deal , even with the fast Prime shipping .  
1	  This camera sounds good in specs , but the pictures are what you 'd expect from an inexpensive digital camera . The colors are washed out , and the images are poor quality . Spend a little more money and get a betterr camera .  
2	  This keypad is great for working with Quickbooks . Entering numbers is a breeze . It installed easily , with XP . Received quickly , even over the Christmas rush . Excellent response to inquirys . ( Just a note .. if you select ' standard shipping ' , there is no tracking number available . )  
2	  OMG - I swear I cried after listening to the hardest pumping stuff I could throw at this setup . BEST $ 200 + I HAVE EVER SPENT . This is how music in a small personal space should sound - it will FILL your computer room with AWESOME sound and drive your neighbors nutts . No need for a receiver , built in surround sound hardware , 500 + watts , LOTS of connections - you can't go wrong . BEST thing about this speaker system is that YOU CANNOT destroy it by turning it up too loud - they knew the limits of the speakers and have the max RIGHT at the perfect spot .  
2	  I wear the shuffle when I 'm working out at the gym , running on the beach , and just doing stuff around the house . It is hard to keep it clipped sometimes so I recommend buying the armband or a lanyard . Other than that , it does exactly what I wanted it too - keeps me motivated with good music . :)  
2	  Needed a new hard drive for my mom 's laptop as the old one was going out . This is the exact same model as the one that was originally in it , and it works just fine with Windows 7 running on it .  
2	  I recently purchased the Speed light 580EX II . I don't have money to plunk down on a gizmo just because some magazine drools over the product specifications . Im a simple guy , and I just want a light unit that will allow me to grow my skills and be capable of doing what I want it to do . I dont have the time or money to hire a Geek to explain the operating guide to me . I figure for the price of this unit , I should be able to put batteries in it and go ! If you do buy it , thats what you can expect from this flash unit . But I really suggest you learn to use all of its flexible settings , and you will not be sorry with your purchase . It has been easy to use , and I strongly suggest you enhance you purchase with a good diffuser . You friends will drool at your great pictures . There are plenty of knowledgeable reviews on this flash , please read them . I am just an average guy who does Photography as a hobby . I consider this unit as one of my best buys !  
2	  This charger was in very excellent condition like new , genuine my laptop works great again excellent price for this excellent item .  
1	  This is the worst digital camera i 've ever owned . Flaws : 1 . autofocus is slow and in about 50 % of cases will focus on the wrong central object . This is evident because small bracket signs bracket the object that the camera is focusing on . So it is readily apparent whether your subject agrees with the camera 's . About half the time it won't . Don't try to just snap a picture without seeing where the brackets are located or you will be severely disappointed . 2 . The shutter lag is unforgivably slow . You have to half depress the button to see what it is focusing on , this takes about 0.5 sec , and then depress fully to take your picture , another 0.4 sec . By this time your subject is long gone .. 3 . The autoflash is horrible . This is in part a consequence of numbers 1 and 2 above . Because the autofocus is often mistargeted and slow , the flash will be tailored for the wrong subject . 4 . Indoor photography is blurred or overexposed . Again , because the autofocus is so slow , if you try to take a simple flash photo , it will either shut off the flash entirely or overexpose your photo . Forget low light pictures . 5 . The touch screen is absolutely pointless . Program mode is also pointless since low light photos are so grainy as to be unviewable . 6 . The cycling time between 2 photos is extremely slow . If you are trying to capture several photos of a meaningful scene , forget it . Just take 1 and hope it is in focus . 7 . The battery is proprietary , rather short lived , and slow to charge in the provided charger . So your option is to shell out $ 40 for another battery . Pros : In outdoor full light conditions the pictures are satisfactory . But not at dusk or night time , and forget trying to take cool night time outdoor pictures . Again , this is the worst digital camera i 've ever owned . There are identically priced cameras from Canon and Kodak which are vastly superior . And i 'm going back to them . Or maybe i 'll try a Casio . I had a 3mp Kodak ez-share which i hated but was much much better than this product . if anyone from pentax wants to make up for this travesty they can contact me at [ .. ] Please avoid this device .  
2	  Seems fast in my SD500 , which used to be really slugish when using an old blue SanDisk 128MB card . No more waits for the buffer to flush to the card , even after doing long videos . Overkill on capacity , even for a 7.1MP camera - you can shoot 322 max resolution images ! Perhaps it comes into it 's own when you do a lot of video ( 8'31 " ) ? As someone else posted I 'm too paranoid about loosing photos to even get close to full ..  
2	  I 've read in some forums that this VGA cooler would actually fit an 8600 gts video card , is it true ? anyone know if this information is accurated ? i got an evga 8600gts 512ddr3 video card and i would like to know if this cooler would actually fit it to just buy it . Thanks for the help in advance =)  
2	  I was glad to get this remote . I 'm a novice , but it works . The only bad part is the remote has to be pointed at the sensor in front when you 're out in open spaces , but any other time , the signal bonuces off of walls . Try to think about the pros than the cons and let it work in your favor .  
1	  I have a unibody MacBook pro , 15 " , and this protector didn't come anywhere close to fitting it . It was way too small . I don't know if they sent me the wrong one or what , but I 'm not going to spend time waiting to see if the next one fits-I 'll just get a refund .  
2	  Great product at a great price . I use it for my guitar amp and pedal board . It 's fits in my pedal bag nicely and the insurance is awesome ..  
2	  I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and I must say it works . Fits my notebook really well , and the edges of the case frame out the shape for added protection . The bumps on the inside provide shock support which gives me peace of mind and I also like the orange outline accents . Would buy again if I had another 15.4 inch notebook . If it fit tighter just a smidgen more I would give every category 5 stars .  
2	  I love this . We use it to shred cheese . It works great . It saves us money when we shred our own cheese verses buying it already shredded . Plus it tastes better . I would recommend this product to anyone .  
2	  This is a nice little product . It pretty much does what it says it does and gives you a significant range boost over a standard wireless card . It will frequently expose networks that you can't even see with your normal card , and it will allow you to achieve a stable connections to networks that your normal card can see but not connect to . The software it came with performs fine , although there is no reason you can't just install the driver and use Windows to connect . I prefer the Hawking software since it shows a network 's connection strength as a percent rather than just bars . My only real complaint with this product and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that its not easily transportable . As other reviewers have mentioned the dish does not fold down so it would be pretty easy to break during transport . Your best bet is to keep the original box which will pack it securely , but thats takes up a lot of room in a suitcase so its not very practicle for trips . Bottom line , if you want something for stationary / local use this is a great product , but if you 're looking for something you can travel with you would be better off with something a little more compact .

1	  Guess what they dont mention ? This product contains the hated RIAA secure digital music initiative ie it wont play all of the . mp3 that you downloaded . Read this quote from news . com " However , not everyone considers such security a step forward . Secure Digital includes software that complies with Secure Digital Music Initiative standards protecting against unauthorized replication of copyrighted content . As a result , digital-audio files downloaded from music services , .. cannot be played on devices that use Secure Digital cards " In short you will only be able to use this with the RIAA approved songs and only as long as you pay the monthly fee . NO THANKS !  
1	  Hardware is great . A wonderful little device . The software is next to useless . It simply does not work , and their technical support has not EVER respond to my attempts to contact them . A shame , but unless they actually make software that works , I would have to say avoid buying from them . I have not been able to update the music on the internal memory for months due to the freezing , crashing and very low quality of their code .  
1	  This sorry cheap excuse for a toy camera broke before I could even get one picture developed . Plus , this is not a real Lomo . Fake , low-quality and lame .  
1	  I paid a lot of money for this film and it doesn't even work ! I got 3 pictures out of it and they barely developed .. the rest of the film came out all messed up . Upset does not even describe how I am feeling .  
1	  I asked for a double CD Jewel Case and got a triple . This is totally unsatisfactory to me and I like to know if I can get double CD Jewel cases from this source . Thank you . Karin Meier-Rottmann  
2	  This product has lived up to my expectations . I have yet to use the Bluetooth tech or the MP3 player but , then again , why do you buy a GPS ? I live in a major city and the real time traffic alert is great . The only negative point I have is that the volume could be a bit louder , especially with the background noise while traveling at high speeds or with the window down . I highly recommend this product .  
2	  Got an ipod a few weeks ago . Software worked fine with WXP ( SP2 ) Device really easy to use . Took it on a trip to Argentina . Great on the airplanes . The right side of the earphones shipped with the unitdeveloped a buzzing sound after a week . Don't think itwas caused by misuse . I 'll try returning it to Compusafor a new unit . Problem is the earpieces . The neckstrap and ear piece cords tend to tangle easily . The on switch picks up dirt . But these are minorconcerns . Recommend the device highly . My laptop is dual boot ( WXP , Linux ) Under linuxyou can mount the device and see all the files .  
2	  If you wanna get away from the iPod fad and not pay bundles of cash just because its an apple ipod then this ia a very good , reliable & compareable player . Its tiny , plays videos and does everything if not more than an ipod nano . Its definately smaller than a nano did i mention that ! All in all cheaper better and i love it ~ ~ ~ ~  
2	  If you need a universal remote and you want one to also control your XBOX 360 , do not hesitate , this is the one . I had searched for a while for the perfect universal remote and finally decided on this one and I truly reccomend it . The user manual , which is basically non existent is not that great , but once you set it up and spend some time with it , it 's great . Give yourself an hour or two to fine tune the remote , and you 'll ask how you have gone so long without it . I have a Comcast DVR , RCA Audio Reciever , Samsung HDTV , a Pelican AV Selector , and the XBOX 360 and this remote controls all of them . You also create a " profile " for each activity using the different sources . If I watch TV , I 'm using the TV , the Reciever and the DVR and the profile I create controls all three , plus I can make any buttons do whatever I want . Because the default choice for OnDemand was far up on the remote I made one of the unused XBOX buttons ( yellow ) my OnDemand button . The remote is actually better than I thought it was going to be , serioulsy . I searched for ages and I 'm glad I made this choice . The only reason I 'm writing this review is because the remote worked beyond what I thought it would do and I figure there has to be more people like me trying to figure out which one is best . One hint I 'll share is that if you click on " devices " it will cycle through your sources and profiles , something I found by accident that made the remote even easier to use . I thought I had to use the LCD select areas to get back to my " watch tv " setting , but by hitting " devices " it will cycle back to you profile . Anyways , easily 5 stars !  
2	  I ordered these for my two-year-old twins to help keep them entertained on a plane flight and long car trip . They worked wonderfully ! Scaled to just the right size , but also adjustable so I know they 'll last a number of years . All I had to do was make sure I practiced a few times with the kids at home before we actually needed them on the road . They kept them on for most of our 2 + hour plane ride , and watched an entire movie on our 7-hour drive . Lifesavers !  
1	  Provided no lightning protection to my brand new Mac Pro from a nearby strike . Installed exactly as instructed . Now down to just one ethernet port on this Mac .  
1	  I successfully used the Targus PAPWR005U power inverter on a 400 + mile trip to power my Mac PowerBook G4 ( to watch DVDs ) with the kids . Unfortunately it only made the one trip . The next week , on another 400 + mi car ride , the inverter started beeping constantly and then went into shutdown mode , I 'm assuming because it was drawing too much power and was overheating . At 90 Watts , the power output matched the power draw from the Mac PowerBook , but didn't have enough umph to spare . I 'd caution everyone to check the power rating on their laptop power bricks first before using it with a power inverter . Get an inverter that is at least 1.5-2x the power rating of the device you want to use .  
1	  i have tried using this hub multuiple times and every time it either locks up my computer or freezes it till i unplug it . programs stop working or work slowly . i used it to connect external hard drives and a wireless mouse . the mouse did not work at all .  
1	  The print functions work fine , both color and text . It will scan from software , but it won't respond to scan requests from the control panel , which is the main reason I bought it . Thankfully , I did not waste money having this boat anchor shipped to me , I 'll just dump it off back at the store . I put a call in to tech support and he walked me through some tests , then gave up and said there must be something wrong with my pc . I tried installing the software on 2 different pc 's : 1 2003 server , the other xp pro sp2 , neither one allowed one touch scanning . In fact the xp machine didn't recognize the device at all .  
2	  Great for the price , haven't really put it to the test quite yet , but have used it a little and it seems to work very smoothly !  
1	  Volume no longer worked at 1 year , I called Sangean told Customer Support the issue and I was asked when I purchased it , he told me to send it in even though it was out of warranty , he never mentioned that it would cost me , I followed their instruction for returns and sent it insured ( $ 6 + 1 hour of my time to wrap it , take it to the Post Office , and a gallon of gas ) as recommended , the return window for to receive back it is 3-5 weeks , at 6 weeks I called wondering what happened as I had not received the radio back , Customer Support person said , " it 's been here , we 're waiting for a check from you for $ 27 ( + $ 6 insured postage and fee = $ 33 , my time + gas I 'm already past another $ 40 , to repair a $ 40 radio ? ) I told him it 's not worth it , send it back to me ! I have bought many cheaper portable radios for 1/3 the price of their piece of junk that have lasted for years ! They never communicated to me that they were holding my piece of junk Sangean radio , I had to call them to find this out . My jingle for Sangean is First Time Last Time , I would rate them a " 0 " if I could .  
2	  Works exactly as advertised . The battery-based system is MUCH more convenient than most of the other designs I saw . Definitely the best extender on Amazon .  
2	  I purchased these binoculars for an Alaskan cruise last month . After studying many brands and specifications I chose the Magellan 8X25 for the sizee and weight for walking trips and I was not disappointed . Besides those attributes , the Magellans performed extremely well both in clarity and ease of use as well as use with or without glasses . The only downside is the carry case which is cumbersome but adequate . I highly recommend .  
1	  These VHS tapes are garbage . On short play , ALL ( we bought 5 ) show distortion at the beginning of the tape . On long play they are completely unwatchable . If you are thinking it might be the VCR , think again , we have an older tape that looks perfect in short AND long play . I found better tapes at the $ 1 store back when you could find VHS tapes at the $ 1 store . Save your money .  
2	  My only regret has been not getting this sooner . Small and compact but has large LCD displays that can be clearly seen and are well back lit ( the photo doesn't really show it ) . Very accurate and makes prototyping and testing much easier and is safer as the current limit protects the circuits that are being worked on . More than worth the money !  
1	  This is my second purchase of In-ear-headphones . I have a hearing problem and find buds more comfortable than the standard head phone but the soundwith these to me is close to nothing . The first ones are OK . I checked these against all the headphones I have and I suppose that is just the way theyare . Price was OK and that is about all . Reviews on Amazon were a little mixed on these .  
2	  Haven't you alway wanted to show a friend that crazy photo of your boss or teacher that you took ? Now you can - anywhere , everywhere ! And slideshows ! Wow . As a digital photographer ( thanks to my buddy Exilim ) , I have taken over 7,000 photos since Christmas 2003 . I can now show slideshows from my cousin 's wedding or from my brother 's birthday party when I go over to a friend 's house by connecting the iPod to a television . And amazing - 40 or 60GB with 15 hours of battery ! This is a dream come true - this is iPod Photo .  
2	  I purchased this as a replacement for another portable iPod docking station / speaker system that died after three years of hard use . To my surprise , I liked this better than the previous one ! Here are the things I like about it : 1 ) It works great either on AC power ( 110/220 dual voltage , for those of you who may live overseas , this means no need for transformers , just a plug adapter to plug it in ) , or on 4 AA batteries . I bought rechargeable batteries and a small battery charger , which means no more batteries in landfills . * Note : it will only charge your iPod when plugged in to AC power . * 2 ) It 's fantastically portable . The information on Amazon 's website implies that this item weighs 4 lbs . - that MUST be a typo . This little unit is sturdy , but I doubt it even weighs a pound ! It 's excellent to pick up and carry from room to room when not plugged in to AC power . 3 ) It has great sound for such a small unit . I am not a connoisseur of speakers , but I am a musician and have my standards . The previous iPod speaker system had a noticeable ( and annoying ) hum whenever I plugged the iPod into the dock ( same iPod ) .. this one has NO annoying hum or buzz , and the sound is warm , pleasant and balanced sounding at both low and high volumes . Here 's the only drawback so far : since I use the blue LED light that indicates power ( either AC or battery ) is extremely bright ! I use the unit ( plugged in ) as a speaker system for my iPod Touch ( 1st generation ) along with a clock app , as an alarm clock .. but the LED light is so bright that I had to put a little square of black plastic electrician 's tape over it in order to darken it , because it was illuminating the bedroom so brightly that I couldn't sleep ! Overall , with the exception of the LED issue , this is a great unit and a great value for the price ! I 'd definitely buy again .  
2	  I was not expecting alot because of the price . The setup was much easier than I dreamed it would be . Even when it makes a mistake it will walk you through corrections very easily . Well worth the money and more .  
2	  This is a good little card . Don't know if there is much to rave about , but at least there is nothing to complain about . Very trustworthly card .  
2	  Excelent printer ! Set up was a snap .. you will need a usb2 hi speed cable to connect to your computer .. It is fast and relatively quiet . I love the LCD display that allows you to view your photos from the camera before printing . The only down side if there is one is the cost of ink ( it only comes with a start up set of cartridges ) and the body feeling rather flimsey . In either case , it is a lot of printer for the money .  
1	  Package contains only the " cradle " and a USB cable identical to the original cable included with the player . The " docking cradle " I received was simply a larger version of the dongle that comes packaged with the Zen Vision M.Based on the product description , I expected an A / C adapter to be provided with the cradle , making the purchase worthwhile . In fact , we ordered * two * of these docking stations based on this expectation . Since , in essence , we spent $ 80 to get two packages of redundant plastic , we are returning them for a refund . Also , please be advised that it is necessary to remove any case or skin from your Zen Vision before it will fit into the the cradle .  
1	  I installed it to my xp , the GPS receiver cannot detect anything , the user interface is confusing , I tried everything , but the GPS receiver still doesn't work , finally I return it . Then I bought a Microsoft Street , it works perfect , quick and easy set up , except that it doesn't have voice functionality .  
2	  This external hard drive case ( Case Logic PHDC-1 ) is designed for the larger variants . They fit most drives big and small . Here 's the hard drives I 've fitted ( listed from approximately biggest to smallest ) : Dynex DX-HD302513 Enclosure ( fits perfectly under the elastic band ) Patriot Gauntlet 2 PCGTII25S Enclosure ( fits well ) HGST Touro Mobile Pro ( fits well ) WD My Passport ( fits , but very loose ) However , I also tried my external hard drives on the Case Logic QHDC-101 . The Gauntlet and the Touro Mobile Pro fits perfectly on the QHDC-101 case . It 's as if the case was designed for the two drive . The Western Digital drive fits too , but it doesn't fit as perfect . So the QHDC-101 is a good case , but the reason why I decided to buy the PHDC-1 on amazon was because this case fits my larger Dynex hard drive enclosure . I also bought two more of the PHDC because it fits all the hard drives , which the QHDC-101 doesn't . In retrospect , I should have bought some QHDC-101 's and some PDHC-1 's . The make quality is great . I don't have much to say about the material quality . There is some rubber , and some plastic . The case is hard . My only gripe is the insides are not completely black . The inside material is grey , but there is no difference in functionality with color right ?  
1	  The unit did not do well at playing back WMAs . I tried various bit rates and burn rates on the CD burner as suggested in the accompanying leaflet , but the thing would not play back without glitches . The WMAs played back fine on the computer .  
1	  I work in IT and after using this router and also getting it replaced with another we ran into constant problems where the WiFi would drop and the only way to reset it was to power cycle the unit . I tried multiple different things such as using only N or G signal , disabling QoS and even leaving the encryption off with no luck . Ended up going with a little more expensive Netgear router and it has been running perfect .  
1	  I unfortunately paid a lot of money for this terrible camera . It was a huge disappointment . We missed many wonderful shots of our new son because the zoom on this camera just doesn't translate to the prints . Everything was off center . I was majorly disappointed in this camera , I thought Olympus was a quality name and boy was I wrong . I went back to using an old canon snappy and get pics that are 500 times better . Steer clear of this one . I also had the same on / off issues that another reviewer had . this camera is just plain awful .  
1	  The headset is comfortable and works just fine . Sound quality is great . I plugged it into a Panasonic multi-line phone from the late 1980s and it worked perfectlyHowever the plastic frame broke after a a few months of very gentle use . The plastic frame is quite brittle and thin in critical areas . I doubt anyone can expect more than a year of daily usage . This is Engineering 101 - thin brittle plastic will break . I have also refrained from rotating the microphone because it creates static every time I 've done that . This makes me think , as others have already noted - the wires may be prone to breaking . At about $ 10.00 , this headset is cheap . But it is a throw away item and for the price , I guess I should have expected that . As noted , my Panasonic hard wired phones have been exceptionally reliable and have been used daily for decades . Update : July , 2010I had to purchase a replacement . The plastic frame has been held together with tape for months and now there is static , seemingly from the microphone connection that won't go away  
2	  I love this repeater . The construction looks a little low tech but the execution is well thought out . It has increased my signal acceptance by ten fold . The only gripe I have is the velcro mounting tape for the receiver eye is a bad idea . I had to replace it with a much stronger double stick foam to keep it attached to the back of my TV . Other than that I fully recommend this product .  
1	  Connected to my computer , XP sees the device but ( despite what the manual says ) it would not give access to it ; keeps asking for the driver . Smartdisk site says no driver required , when you try to get tech support , you have to register , but the site does not recognize your user-id if you do register . Recommendation : Stick to western digital , maxtor or other recognized brand .  
1	  After having problems with the ability to clean filters ' surfaces , and needing to buy 2 polarizers ( I always have a spare ) for my new Canon 24-105mm pro lens for my Canon 5D full-frame SLR digital body , I ordered several different polarizers in 77mm size for testing : I 'd keep the winner . All of the polarizers named in this review had front threads for filter stacking and lens cap attachment . My problem with cleaning the polarizers ' glass surfaces : When a drop of rain or some spray from a garden 's water fountain landed on the polarizer , I could spend 10 minutes wiping the filter and all I did was move smears all over the place ; I COULD NOT get the glass clean ! When shooting into nighttime street lights , the sun , or other light sources , the smears really hurt image quality . It was like shooting through a dirty window . My tests involved putting a wet fingerprint and some saliva ( sometimes you try to blow dust from the filter and you end up depositing some spit on it ! ) on the front and rear faces of each polarizer . The Hoya HD MC 8-layer placed 2nd easiest to clean : Five seconds of cleaning with a cloth and it was good as new . Number 1 winner was the Heliopan polarizer ( $ 153.00 ) : it almost cleaned itself ! HOWEVER , it was not a thin-ring mount , and it heavily vignetted the corners of my lens at 24mm . The number 2 winner , the Hoya HD MC 8-layer is a thin-ring design so any vignetting is a minor problem ( it 's as good as it 's going to get ) . In third place was the Hoya DMC PRO1 polarizer . In fourth place was the Heliopan SH-PMC . In last place was the B + W Multi-coated which was absolutely terrible ( as bad as my previous Nikon polarizers which I returned to Nikon who refunded my purchase price ( thank you , Nikon ! ) . Since the Hoya HD MC 8 layer polarizer is extremely easy to clean , is a thin-mount design , and has front threads , there 's no reason to consider any of the others . Unfortunately , this polarizer is the most expensive of all the polarizers I tested ( 6 including Nikon 's ) ; however , unless you lose it or break it it 's a one-time purchase , and you need clean glass to make good images .  
2	  I just bought these speakers to replace a 2.1 THX system from cambridge soundworks that I purchased about a year and half ago . That set has never really impressed me ( just ordinary sound quality ) so I started some research and thankfully found this set . It is more than I wanted to spend ( 222 $ from another reliable on-line retailer ) , however I agree w / others .. it is worth the money ( high-end quality / a lot of features ) .. and it does list for 400 $ . PC World recently reviewed 5.1 speakers and this one was ranked first and also considered a " best buy " @ 400 $ . This set has received awesome ( nearly perfect across the board ) reviews everywhere I looked , that should tell you something . Also , I own logitech keyboard / mouse and I have been very satisfied w / their products so far . Now I just have to buy some speaker stands for the rear channels and I 'm golden . I live in an apartment and I 'm sure the neighbors will love the powered 10 " sub :) Yes , I know it 's big-it 's not a 6.5 or 8 " sub , people . You gotta expect it to be big / heavy . This is the quintessential 5.1 PC system in my opinion , at least until 6.1 & 7.1 start taking over and / or if Logitech figures ways to improve upon this set . In closing , you simply can not find a better / higher rated 5.1 system in this price range . Highly recommended .  
1	  This printer gulps through ink and when you run out , you cannot print anything else until the cartridge is replaced . The scan quality is marginal at best . Receipts and other non-traditional media are problematic for this scanner . Online support for this Epson model on their website has not been available or ' down ' the last 2 times that I have tried to access it . I just replaced my black cartridge and the printer only printed in color . Basically , I need to buy a new printer and it won't be an Epson !  
1	  I am very disappointed because this item I bought came empty . I opened the box and I found nothing but some papers and no filter inside it ! Really angry !  
1	  I bought this after hooking up a Digital Stream DTV converter box , hoping to eliminate pixillation on one channel . Signal strength didn't increase one bit . It 's not any weaker , but it sure didn't boost it as advertized . I moved it to the other converter box and got the same results . Maybe my antenna cable run is just too long ( 85ft ) for it to be effective . One note .. follow the instructions and plug it into the wall outlet AFTER connecting the antenna cable or you 'll get a nasty shock .  
2	  This was my first hand held ; it was received as a gift and at first I was not impressed . My 105 was not responding to the stylis commands and seemed to be a total waste . But with one call to Palm 's Customer Service center I had a replacement unit within just a few days . For my purposes such as names and addresses , calendar , To Do lists and Notes it 's great . I 've already replaced my hardcopy calendar and Agenda with the 105 . Considering what you 're going to use the hand held for , the basic 105 is prefect ( why spend a ton extra for stuff you my nor use ) but if you need a more expansive unit you 'll need something more advanced than the 105 . I have to say there are still some Graffiti characters to which it doesn't respond , but overall I have to give it high marks for it 's fuctionality and basic value .  
2	  # - # - # - [ Why this rating ? ] - # - # - # Some 2 years ago , when I bought my HV20 , I did a lot of research on tapes , and the consensus overwhelmingly pointed to the Panasonic AMQ family . So far , with over 50 tapes used , I am a happy camper indeed - no dropouts , and great quality . I am a true believer now , and hence the 5-star " I Love It ! " rating . # - # - # - [ Tape Types ] - # - # - # Irrespective of the tape you decide to use , I learned that it was more important to be loyal to the type of lubricant used - referred to by my friends as wet or dry tapes . The Panasonic belongs to the dry type family , whereas Sony tapes use a wet lubricant . For instance , Panasonic claims that this tape uses a " .. dry type lubricant [ that ] causes less video head wear ( - 4m after 500H ) . It also prevents head clogs and extends head life . " While some on the ' net argue that this distinction is an urban myth - I decided to trust my professional friends on this issue . This difference is not material until you switch between the two types - which can lead to clogged video heads . # - # - # - [ Archival ] - # - # - # I rely very heavily on tape as an archival mechanism for all my HD masters .

2	  My zune works flawlessly . The software is the only thing that was a bit strange at 1st was the software , but after a little time spent learning the program it was easy to use .  
2	  When I turn on my Iphone music up to 75 % lound volume , it start making disturbing noise , for the best result , turn the MP3 player to < 50 % volume then turn the car volume up , it will have a good a clear sound . But for this super low price , I can not ask too much for 100 % perfect , overall I like it . By David Du ( Silicon Valley , CA )  
1	  This is my second pair of these earphones and the 2nd pair that one of the wires has pulled loose and cannot be re-inserted to get stereo sound . While they were working they were great but if you cannot keep them together there is a big problem with the design .  
2	  This is my third portable DVD player in less than a year , and even though it is the cheapest of the three , it is by far the best ! This thing plays anything I throw at it ! I also use it as a picture viewer via the sd slot . The usb is a nice feature as well . The picture and sound are quite acceptable for something in this price range and beyond . It may not be as ruggedly built as my Philips , but I am confident it will hold up as long as I use a little comon sense . For the price and the features , I really don't care if it won't tolerate mishandling . I love this thing and will probably buy another one if it does break . They say you get what you pay for , but with this player , you get a lot more than what you pay for !  
2	  Does everything I bought it for - runs without issue on Windows Vista and the Polar sync software I use with my S625X watch . NOTE FOR VISTA USERS : Vista won't automatically find the driver over the internet . You need to use the CD that comes with the adapter , and point it towards the folder with the Windows XP driver . After approving the driver for installation , it should work fine .  
1	  .. since it was free . The filter does not appear to have any coatings , it flares and does cause a noticeable reduction in image contrast . I use this only where a protection filter is needed , where there is a spalsh hazard or sand / grit / flying debris in the air . Outside of those situations , be sure to remove this filter before shooting .  
1	  I ordered a total of 3 cables and no sound played through either cable , only video . I later confirmed they were damaged since I ran to Walmart and spent over [ .. ] for just two cables . I was warned that Best Buy charges even more for these . Customer service person was actually helpful and remarked that the cables are made in batches therefore a few could be damaged all at once . They gave me a refund with no hassle . I opted not to exchange and just bought locally since I was leery of quality and didn't want to wait another week for shipping . Honestly I ended up paying a lot more elsewhere . I think the quality on these cables is hit or miss . If they work you 've saved a lot of money and if they don't you can still return it .  
1	  Maybe good for the price ( in which people look at three megapixels and the price and jump for joy thinking they have gem in their hands ) Maybe . I sell digital cameras and there is absolutely no justification in buying this camera , mostly because the camera simply cannot zoom at its 3.2 megapixel setting , and its digital zoom available at other settings is decidedly horrible . Why not just buy the p52 or p72 .. not much more in price , yet actually allow you to frame a picture without resorting to walking right up the subject 's eye ball . And why earth does everyone seem to l ike the ugly cybershot design ? I mean I know its all opinions , oh nevermind . Pictures we 've printed under halogen lights at work are not even close to as good as similiar pictures from competing canon , nikon and fuji model .. A70 / A60 3100 3800 and far worse than the typical 4 by 6 stills from the various kodak models .  
1	  Most annoying piece of hardware that I have used . Pointer tracking , The most important of mouse 's function , it does a worse job .  
2	  I purchased this three pack to test out a vintage Polaroid I found at a thrift store . The battery pack is built into the film and it works just fine . I wish that film for these cameras was not so expensive ; however , I understand why it is . I was not disappointed with this item .  
2	  This product is a true life saver . I was traveling to work when I forgot to send the regional reports to my office so I got my phone out and my pocket pc and of course my Socket CF modem connection and within minutes they were sent and my job was saved thatnks to Socket CF .  
2	  I found the smaller bag just large enough to fit my Camcorder plus all itsaccessories , as well as my Digital Nikon camera with all its spare parts . I also had a very small camcorder that I owned previously , and there wasenough room for it as well . The Manual for the Camcorder was very heavyand thick , about 2 inches , due to the fact they included all the directions in 3 , or 4 languages . Thus , I was compelled to remove the ForLang sections , and then all three cameras fit with all their extras , including the Manuals . It is a very handy item , allowing one to have allthe Photo materials in one place to better keep tract of .  
1	  I 'm sure small size and appearance have their merits , but above all , a product should work . To me , nothing else matters if it doesn't work , and this drive is unfathomably slow . It 's slow to the point that I 'd rather use a floppy disk . If it 's too slow to use , no one is going to find it effective . I don't think I 'm the intended customer for this product . I would never have chosen a flash drive that had the lanyard hole on the case . As another reviewer remarked , if you put a string through the hole in the case , you could lose the flash drive . The drive snaps in securely , so this is a minor point . Still , it 's poor design by Lexar . As I stated , my wife gave me this as a gift . Normally , I don't buy any electronics without thoroughly researching them . This is a $ 50 item , so I thought I 'd just use it . I 've sorely disappointed . The market may be fragmenting , and this may be targeted to youths who appreciate the many colors . But I can't imagine a youth , who will likely be moving audio , video , and photos using this drive . It 's just too slow . UPDATE : 6/26/07 : I 've been using the firefly a lot , and though it is still ghastly slow in some instances , it has performed well , especially for the money . I notice the slowless mostly when I am moving directories that contain large numbers of files or subfolders , which is common in the less expensive drives . It also seems to periodically choke on larger files . I 'm still not over the fact that it is so small and easy to lose - to easy . I think we 've reached diminishing returns on small size for jump drives . I don't want to make them any smaller , I 'm already past the point where i can keep track of it . Also , I still dislike the fact that there is no lanyard hole on the physical drive itself . I would never attach one to the flimsy plastic cover and risk losing the drive . It has been a good little drive , despite my initial complaints . However , I 'd look for something faster and sturdier in the future .  
1	  Don't waste your time . I bought this and the first one I recieved was broken . Amazon promptly replaced it . But it came with the housing cracked . Sound was muffled and crackleing . Replaced it with a BIC lets see how that turns out .  
2	  This is the kind of product that 's perfect when you 're triping , cause there are cleaner frequencies , so the sound quality is pretty good !  
2	  I 've had CB 's since the late 1970 's .. Cobras , Unidens , and most others . Midland does , and always has made a good product . This is no different . The handhelds are great if you are in an RV campsite looking for others , or on the road , searching for traffic info . Face it , the 1970 's are gone - and even then , power jacked skip talkers ruined a lot of ' otherwise friendly ' local chats . In the area I 'm working near Canada , I get really tired of 2000-watt skip talking power hounds out of Orlando Florida blasting so hard to talk to someone in LA , that you can't hear your neighbor a mile away . Face it , we aren't buying bad radios , we are being stomped on by illegal users like these guys . Don't think badly of the Midland 75HH . It is a good little 4-watt radio . It 's output with a ' Lil Wil ' magnet mount antenna is comparable to a Cobra 29LTD with a suitable tuned antenna . Get your SWR 1.1:1 or so on 20 , get 1 and 40 as close as you can , and you should have no problems reaching out a few miles . On a good day , you can get 3-5 miles .. and that 's all they are really designed for . Don't forget , the more sunspots , the further you can reach .. and sunspots are starting to pick up now .. Good radio .. I gave it 4-stars , because they 've never offered this handheld with a mated external magnet-mount antenna .. maybe I expect too much .. ( but you can get almost the same thing in a dash mount , and add an antenna , for the same price ) .  
2	  My last mouse was the older sibling of the MX nano . I liked it because it was small , light , and traveled well on my desk while never skipping at all . But the thing that aggravated me the most was the " fast scrolling " feature , where the wheel click is ROBBED and replaced with a devil machination that disables my click in lieu of a fast wheel . Man was not intended to not click wheel , and it was a total affront to my sense . In order to have a decent wireless mouse , I had to get the gaming one . But since I also game with my PC , naturally it was a wise purchase . The mouse is LARGE . Dainty hands need not apply , as this mighty pointer of vengeance was meant to be held in the hands of a CHAMPION ! The sides are made of the finest grit material so that not even the oil residue from a Hot Pocket will allow your hand to escape your mouse , your grip forever bound to your weapon of choice ( until you need a bathroom break ) . DPI buttons are located under the .. OK , here 's where it gets 4 stars not 5 . There 's 2 issues I have with the wheel . The first is that it sticks out WAY too much . I assume this is so you can use the next useless feature in logitech 's awesome arsenal : SIDE SCROLLING ! The oversized scroll wheel allows you to side scroll your way through any horizontally plump document with ease . But in a world of widescreen monitors who needs this . I guess if I could send this back to 1995 naked and speaking an austrian accent I might be a little happier , as long as no one sent huge pictures back in time to try and kill me . The second issue is the wheel click must have been calibrated for Larry , logitech 's resident arm wrestling champion and wheel clicker . The wheel click is a workout in of it 's own , and you 'll manage to scroll up or down in your quest to push the wheel down unless you attack it vertically like a hawk catching the downed field mouse . The DPI indicator has 3 lights . At first it is set to LOW MED HIGH until you install the software , then it uses 2 lights for between levels . You can set the dpi between 2000 and 400 , meaning you can be someone 's worst enemy if you turn around and later when you grab a sniper rifle . It 's by no means an industry leading setting right now , but for a wireless mouse it does a greta job in dispensing hurt cheese and the pain deli . Leaving the mouse alone activates a minigame called " Do I get to swap out the battery now ? " Adding 2 battery packs to this pack was a nice touch , since I 'm pretty sure that they wanted to add 1 big battery but someone said " Hey , we can simply slip it into 2 battery packs and create an awesome feeling of POWERING UP ! " Sure enough , it feels like reloading the click of a gun , the notches lining up and the satisfying click of the battery . Don't worry , you 'll tire of it because you 're bound to do it every few days . There 's the remnants of the dual button left of the side . Like Robin Williams without chest hair it sits there with nothing to do . Lazily , I assigned him the job of wheel click when I don ; t feel like working out my finger . It 's a great mouse all around , and perfect for the non serious gamer . Unless you have dainty hands and cannot pass into the fields of Valhalla because you cannot wield a proper weapon .  
1	  I 've had this mouse for a few years and it 's been awesome . It really is the perfect size , it 's lighter than most , only needs one battery , and I love all the features . Recently the left click button started giving out ( requires multiple clicks to accomplish one click ) and the pointer would intermittently get stuck or skip . As the frequency of both these issues increased it became apparent that I 'd have to swap for a new one . The reason for the 1 star : Logitech no longer carries this mouse ( the newer replacements are also clunkier ) . I was excited to see that plenty of vendors here still carried the VX Revolution so I purchased one . I actually purchased four to date and returned all of them ( all from different vendors ) . Each new mouse I ordered came in packaging that looked old and dingy ( as if they had either been sitting in a warehouse for some time or had been returned by a customer and shipped out again ) . More importantly , each mouse ended up having the same exact problems in a matter of a few days ( left click and skipping ) . The last one I received worked for two weeks but ended up with the same issues . Logitech is aware of the problem with the VX Revolution but couldn't do anything to help fix the issues ( perhaps the reason for the discontinuation of this model ) . If you get a VX Revolution that works properly then you 'll find that the ergonomics and functionality of this model is the best out there . Since Logitech no longer carries this model you 're bound to get one that was previously returned because it didn't work properly . I ended up getting the MX Anywhere mouse and while I 'll miss the VX Revolution it 's nice to have a mouse that works properly .  
1	  ITS A SCAM ! I read the other reviews before i bought this due to its low price , and they were all pretty good . I tried hooking it up to my xbox 360 and it didnt even recognize a signal . Destination : trash can .  
2	  Bought these because my Sonys could not handle the music range I listen to . I researched headphones extensively and settled with these . Im into hard rock through to classical . I enjoy letting people listen to them . I then enjoy seeing them gasp when I tell them how much I paid . I then struggle to get them back from them ! All in all an ideal travel companion . Koss has my total respect .  
1	  I have had this bag for a few months and used it occasionally . It has been great until a few days ago . Three weeks ago I started using it daily and in that time , one of the side seams has come undone and a zipper on the smaller outer pocket broke off , which was the least used pocket . It still carries my laptop with no problem , but I will go with a different brand next time that provides a quality guarantee of some sort . I cannot find any customer service contact for Microsoft bags . * EditI followed the support link given in the comment to my review . Submitted a support request . Never received a response . Also , one day I picked up the bag by the strap and the plastic clip broke off . No more strap . Looking for a replacement . I did like the style , but not happy with workmanship  
1	  This is the wrong memory i ordered it is home just lying don't have use for it .  
1	  All I can say is , sometimes it works , sometimes it causes Windows to crash . I have had to reinstall this device as many times as I have used it ..  
1	  Never had a more un reliable unit in my life .. Died after 1st movie .. It looked good at first , threw out shipping box figuring it was a winner , now I am the loser . Stuck with a unit that does not work .. out the money and up the creek with a piece of s * t I am greatly disappointed with performance and reliablility of unit .. out $ 64 buck = and now have a unit thatlasted for one movie .. be for warned ! As for Amazon .. suggest you shop local where there is customer friendly support , I don't even have an address to send this unit back to .. Yes I am upset ! ]  
2	  Since my office was a little way off in another room , I needed an ingenious way to connect , albeit ( wireless ) fax machine , still requied connection . I believe this product will work well anytime I need it .  
1	  The player and its display look great , and it 's small enough to fit on a keychain . The sound quality 's very impressive for such a small player , too . Sadly , that 's about all this player has going for it . The interface only lets you scroll through folders , not songs - you must play through songs one at a time to find the one you 're looking for . That would be acceptable on smaller players , but not when you have up to 2GB of music to search through . The shuffle mode is awful - basically it will take eight to ten random songs from whatever you 've selected and loop ONLY those eight repeatedly . Worst of all is the file transfer speed . It takes me over 45 minutes to fill the mp3 player , and that 's using a USB 2.0 cable and port . Overall not the worst player in the world , but extremely disapponting for a Creative product .  
2	  These babies have a nice kick to them ! I use them for my laptop , zune and xbox 360 and I have yet to be disappointed . I live in a dorm room and the volume at 1/3 is pleasurable and don't disturb my neighbors . At 1/2 volume it has my RA knocking on my door :) The only problem I have with this product is that it wasn't FREE . But for this price they 're the best speakers I 've had .  
2	  At my house , during rain storms , there will often be a quick flash of the lights as a branch somewhere falls on the power lines . That type of event would always cause my PC to turn off , and I could loose quite a bit of work or even problems on the hard drive . This little device has keept that from happening for some time . I am very pleased . The battery that is in it does not keep the best " time " estimates for battery life , but knowing that the short spikes or loss of power will not cause me issues makes it worth the price .  
1	  I recently purchased these headphones and must say that I am dissapointed with their sound quality . While the range and volume is fine-bass response is ok and highs play without distortion-the overall sound is muddled . The sound is not crisp and clear . Rather , it sounds as if my music has already passed through some heavy object before reaching my ears . There is no problem understanding the music , don't get me wrong . Compared to the Coby headphones ( bought at around the same price ) that I was trying to replace , however , these headphones are simply not very good . I think Sennheiser makes good headphones , but I wouldn't waste any money on these . If you want a pair of Sennheisers , pay a little more to get one of their better models .  
1	  Was suppose to be for low profile but wasn't . I still can use it but , not for system I ordered it for .  
1	  I purchased this product from amazon . com . I expected that Epson could provide a good product when it comes to scanner . The scanner arrived , and I was excited about it . After installing the software and seeting up the scanner , I scanned my first picture . The scanned result looks like it had specks of dust and scratches in the image . I scanned the same picture in a diferent position in the scanner , and I got diferrent results . It still had spots and scratches in different places . Called Epson and their answer was that the picture was deffective . They sent me to an Epson Service center , and the scanner spent a week in repairs . At the end nothing was acomplished . I had to return the scanner to amazon . com . I am looking for a new scanner . I hope Epson improves it 's customer service department ; it is worth nothing when it comes to trying to help a customer . The Epson service rep was always blaming the end user . He never considered the possibility that the scanner could be deffective . I will be browsing thru amazon . com trying to find a good scanner again .  
2	  I was once before suckered into buying a $ 75 monster hdmi cable . If I had known about this cable I would gotten this instead and saved tons of money . Plugged This into my Xbox 360 and my Computer and I am one happy guy because of the results . This Cable is the real deal and I am happy to say I recommend this cable highly .  
1	  Graphics . Okay . Buttons and remote .. okayPeripheral capability .. looks good but sucksSoftware / firmware .. crappyUser manual .. crappyWhat Kodak should have provided was a software program that could be used to easily crop and size your photos to fit the 800x480 size . The frame did not even acknowledge when I plugged in a KODAK compactflash ! What pooty-doo ! Look around and compare before you buy this .  
2	  These are the best strings I have ever used . I put them on my Kevin Ryan and a nice Elhers and they absolutely make the instruments sing . They stay in tune longer than other strings , last longer , and sound better . It is worth noting that these are two completely different sounding guitars , with different wood , and the strings still sound superior on both .  
2	  Not the fanciest of cooling fans i have seen , but love it having 3 fans to cover the entire bottom of my laptop , and it does what it is designed to do , cool , and great price , and besides that , you can't see the cooling pad once the laptop is on it . I have a HP G 60 , which does hang over both side a bit , but you can feel the air blowing out to the edges . The only thing that i was not 100 % pleased about , is that the lover edge of my laptop does not catch the lip on the pad , but that is because when the battery that came with the laptop gave out , i replaced it with a heavy duty one , that is not flush with the bottom of the pc . It protrudes about an inch and is probably the culprit . But the laptop sits there just fine without sliding off the pad , and so can be lived with .  
1	  I ordered two units - the first was bad right out of the box . The second began going bad within a few days . The LCD screen had light and dark spots and became so garbled it was completely unreadable . Also , it is not back lit as indicated , or at least not back lit enough to make a difference - and it doesn't light up when a call comes in . Avoid this product .  
2	  I 've owned a Presto pressure cooker for many years and have been very satisfied with it . I purchased this one for my brother , who loves to cook and loves new gadgetry . Mission accomplished : we 're both very happy with our purchase . Just a note , when considering pressure cookers , look for stainless steel . It cooks better , cleans better , feels more secure .  
2	  I have just put in this cartridge , and so far so good . I saved a lot of money - hope it lasts .  
2	  I will be brief . It works fine the sound is good . It takes some time to unpack and set the belt to the disc but not a problem . Both ways either using the built in preanp or the phono in your own preamp work fine . It is a blessing for those that do not have a PHONO input on their preamp . The RCA hookup cable short you may need connectors to extend it . My only complain is that the tone arm cannot be locked on the rest position . In California we have earthquakes .. you know !  
2	  This bag is everything I hoped that it would be . It 's comfortable to carry , holds all of my books and my computer . The zipper top makes it very easy to access what is inside without having to open the front flap . I highly recommend this bag .  
1	  Bought this received it fast . Plugged it in immediate electrical pop sounds . Had a protected light but no ground light . Checked my outlet and ground was fine . Bought a replacement and it all is ok . Was not worth return , Decent protector if you get a working unit . I agree with the reviewer who cited poor quality control .  
1	  This think is really junky - It probably cost $ 1.25 at most to make in some 3rd world country . Zipper broke , the handle came off , etc . Save your money . Invest in a better class and just buy 2 or 3 or whatever it takes to house this amount .  
1	  I bought this camera to replace my camera that takes film . I wish I had waited and saved for a more expensive camera . It 's an ok camera . The flash is so bright that my daughter looks like a ghost . I tried it without the flash and it 's really dark . I can't set it up as a webcam , which I thought I could . You can't use the flash with the camcorder function , so the picture is really dark . It doesn't fit in your pocket , it 's at least 2 inches thick . You really do get what you pay for . I went and bought another roll of film for the pictures that I want to be of quality . I use the digital so I can send pictures of the new baby to family members .  
1	  I 've had the camcorder for only a few weeks and used it right out of the box . There is an easy setting mode that enables the most inexperienced user to use the camcorder right away . Chapters are automatically set up on the DVD during each pause while recording . If you are looking for video quality though , there are better choices . I 've been researching camcorders since I bought this one and have found that the MiniDV camcorders are the better choice right now - in this price range . The video quality on the Sony DCR-DVD305 is fair , at best , even on the best video setting . I have only used the camcorder indoors - maybe the video quality would be more acceptable outdoors . If you do decide to buy the camcorder , I would suggest buying a wide angle lens for a better area coverage during filming . You can buy one for around $ 50.00 . Overall I rate this camcorder as fair due to the video quality .  
2	  This is my first sub and I was just guided by the previewes reviews . I 'm very happy with it . I just need to set it up right . But it gives that punch !  
1	  ok i want to try to clear up this Pyle dabate going on everywhere about wether pyle is good or bad .. If you buy this sub you will be happy , till you blow it because a lot of people dont know that Pyle is like Kicker , made quality old school stuff but when places like amazon and craigslist started selling theyre stuff for cheap they had to downgrade component parts and lower the quality of theyre materials to keep making the money . Not to mension you have about a month long break in period wich you shouldnt be doing much over half power till its nice and broken in .. if your not patient YOU WILL BLOW YOUR WOOFER this goes for kicker and Pyle , yes you will be impressed by this for a little while but if you have the meters to prove it , Pyle loves to wayy over rate there products . this will not push what it says it will .. most pyle products dont , well not for long anywayif you want good subwoofers that will last a long time save your money and go for quality like Alpine , JL , DC , SPL , Memphis , Diomond audio , maybe Hifonics theyre good for the price , etc .. ive had Pyle amps and subwoofers and they both only perform to what they say they will for a week MAX ussually a day or two if you try to push more than 3/4 power . the guy that says his 3 15s pound is probably because .. well .. you have 3 15s lol , i doubt he is going full power on all of themand if someones going to try to say the only reason im saying all this is because i suck at wiring , or im not doing it right , save it , i went to school for this and ive been in car audio for a long time .. i know what im doing  
2	  I was extremely happy with the Tamrac 5273 - holds everything I have and offers great protection . It is easy to carry and when you are able to stand in one place for a while and experiment it acts like a easy access protective tray for the different lenses and filters . My first camera only backpack and I am really liking it .  
1	  I have the same problem in 2/3 of the cars I 've tried it in . The springy center part does not spring out correctly leaving only intermittent contact . I got Garmin to sent me a second one free , but it has the same problem ! This makes 3 total , since I had one of the older style ones with the COM port for my older unit . I had to fix that one using the spring from a ball point pen . It 's not just in my car either . I 've used other car adapters without any problem .  
2	  Where I could not call out for more than a couple of sec . before the wireless call was dropped - I can now use the cell like a regular phone from inside the cabin .  
2	  Hi ! The AC adapter does it job . What more can I say . Thanks !  
1	  I was happy with my Sony IF630Rs for 5 years . In fact , I loved them and now I am crying that they broke . The IF3000s are worthless garbage . First of all , the extremely loud hiss does not only happen when you 're going out of range . Not unless the range happens to be less than 3 feet . I have the transmitter exactly where my TMR-IF630R was , pointing directly at me from about 3 feet away on my desk . While the IF630R sounded great , the IF3000 sounds like listening to AM radio in a 1972 Chevette . I would be better off listening on a computer speaker . The one INSIDE the CPU tower . Maybe the batteries aren't charged enough ? Well , you 'd think that after 2 full days of sitting on the charger , they might be . It 's hard to say though , since unlike the IF630R the 3000 barely seats on the charging terminal and easily slips off . And since the unit takes bizarre Sony-only batteries , I 'm not going to go buy a pair of $ 25 hacked AAs to find out if it 's just a bum cell . Sony must have fired the IF630R team for being excessively competent . The fact that the same company released both products should be an embarrassment . I have saved an eBay search for a used pair of IF630Rs to replace my old pair , because these things are an insult to my ears .  
1	  I have been having trouble with the dvd recorder aspect since the first year I bought it . It made loud clunky noises during finalization , and then about half the time lost the data . I used the warranty and sent it in to be fixed . A couple months later , the recorder was unreliable again . Now the warranty is expired , and I just lost all the data of a program I spent 3 hours recording ( and won't be airing again ) . I 've had it . This dvd recorder / vcr combo is out . Note I gave it two stars because the dvd player and vcr player work .  
1	  The problem with this device is that the ball is very smooth and will slip if it gets the least little bit of grease on it from a skin cream or even eating a potato chip . I use the mouse all day and had to switch to a trackball to avoid repetition injury . The only other mouse I 've used is Logitech which is an optical mouse and requires no reqular cleaning . I 'd definitely not buy Microsoft if you 're a heavy user .  
1	  you can get a new one with specs that blow away this computer for only 100-200 more . This is great for everyday computing . Internet , docs . But if you run editing software , record and edit music , or are a download junkie . Spend the extra 100 or take the time to shop around . Has tiger OSX which was great for PRO TOOLS , but half gig memory won't cut it . PS / you risk breaking computer changing the memory , very delicate , made in mac mini ' early stages .  
2	  When I was much younger , like 18-20 I had a pair of Koss Headphones that I bought at a local music shop for like $ 15 . I 've never had a pair of headhpones i liked that much again . They technically still work , but I broke the connection between the headphone and the head band . I 've been using SennHeiser 201HD 's at work for a few years now . BUT the bass was never terribly pleasing . I had decided to buy a more expensive set of headphones and was reminded of my old Koss Headphones over Christmas . These things are amazing . The base response blows the Sennheisers out of the water ( and yes , I know they are twice as expensive ) the comfort unbelievable . I have even taken them to a local radio shack and they sounded better ( TO ME ) than the 249.99 Beats they had on display . I gotta say , these things rock . Frequency response is unbelievable in a cheap pair of headphones like these .  
1	  Yes the 1/4th inch is perfect size but the 3.5mm female side of the adapter was 3.5mm but expanded SLIGHTLY on top just enough for headphones to slip out of and be where you have to hold it on ANNOYING I have ordered a lot of stuff on amazon but this is the worst I 've ever got on amazon  
1	  I purchased this system because it combined an up-converting DVD and HDMI in / out functions . If you are looking for a smooth operation out of the box , this set is NOT for you . Here are my concerns : - cable connections to the speakers have a proprietary type plug on the back of the system . If their length is sufficient , then there are no problems . Troble is if you need your speakers farther away or need to go around the room to get to them . You can't buy the connectors anywhere and Samsung only sells them along with the cable and , once again , not for longer runs . I had to solder cable to the connectors ( after having ripped apart the plastic on them ) to be able to get to my back speakers - I used my HDMI in / out function , connecting the TV HD box in and connecting out to the TV . This connection never worked . I had to revert to connecting my TV HD box directly to the TV via HDMI and use component video for the DVD / Home theater set . This is quite annoying because this is one feature I was looking for since my HDTV has only one HDMI input . The problem seems to be in the connection of the two HDMI plugs on the theater system since I could see my DVD out of that . If your TV has two HDMI inputs ( as the most recent have ) than you have no problem . - connected the audio from the HD box set via optic cable . This connection sometime looses completely the signal and I have to ' circle ' again through all the input options ( AUX1 > AUX2 > HDMI > DIGITAL IN ) just to get my audio back on . This happens quite often when you switch channels a lot . - sync problems between image and sound : with the digital connection , I seem not to be able to precisely sync the image and sound - remote seems to be " swallowing " battery power . First set of batteries lasted two weeks , I then bought rechargeable batteries but need to refresh their charge every two weeks or so . Compare with other remotes where battery life is at least six months . Overall , an economic system that shows all his problems .  
2	  it is cheap it holds 240 songs and includes an adapter so you can plug it in to the computer with out buying a usb cable made for the phone  
2	  This is my 3rd Palm product and I was hesitant to try it again but for the price thought it might help keep me organized . Unlike earlier models this one is super easy to see with a great color screen . It 's simple but it 's in this simplicity that it can accommodate my needs from keeping track of appts to shopping lists for different stores . It has already saved me a fortune in gasoline costs . When I need something I put it right in and when I 'm out I just pull out the Palm to ensure I pick up everything at once . The only downside was the sync software CD that came with the unit was defective . Once I downloaded directly from the Palm site I haven't had a problem since . I 'd surely go for a 4th palm after this one - in a few years .  
2	  Just for taking photographs , the Sony 828 is the third best camera I own . But the other cameras do not do nearly as well focusing in low light ( where the Sony uses a matrix of lasers ) nor do they take short movies like the Sony will for those situations in which you want more than a photo . I can certainly go out and create purple fringing with this camera . And it overall is not as sharp as my others . Nor will it adapt itself by accepting alternative lenses . But it will consistently get excellent shots under non-extreme conditions . And if you need to get a short talkie , this is the only camera in this range that will do it .  
2	  It was my first experience ordering on line . It was very user friendly and I received my order in a timely manner .  
2	  I bought this because the HD on my laptop was getting full , so i transfered most of what was on my harddrive to the external seagate drive , it comes with bounceback express software , that made it pretty easy to back up evrything i wanted to , i 've had it for three months now and have accessed it numerous times and havent had a problem with it , my only complaint its a little thicker than my buddies firefly drive of the same capacity but for thr price i like mine better .  
2	  This backpack camera bag is an excellent buy . Don't be fooled by the price since it is exquisitely made and quite solid . There 's lots of pockets and it 's easy to customize the interior . Most of all , the bag is comfortable on the back and can be carried by the handle as well . The only concern I can think of is that I wish it had some extra padding although I have found this not to be a problem despite some rough handling with the backpack full of my Canon lenses and 10D body .  
1	  This unit drives me crazy . rarely use the unit and waited too long to return / exchange at Best Buy . The audio drops out every few seconds . Both the digital and analog feeds are affected . On last day of warranty , LG agreed to repair or replace . Got a reconditioned replacement and it too has the same problems . I wish I would have read reviews before purchasing . This was a lot of money to pay for lousy audio . Otherwise , picture an ease of use is nice .  
1	  There are some bluetooth conection problems with Blackberry and othe brands . I just skiped to use the bluetooth . I won't recommed this item .  
1	  The VuPoint reviews are misleading , The VuPoint Camera is just a cheap cell phone camera disguised as an underwater camera , and it is not even a good camera at all . If you don't believe me just take a good look at the camera lens and you will notice that it looks exactly like you phone camera lens . Actually , any cell phone currently in the market can take better pictures than this VuPoint . I returned it before I had a chance test the waterproof case , but the case looked flimsy and the locking mechanism does not have a secure lock , it may open accidentally underwater . Also this camera wins the price as the electronic device with the most fake reviews I have ever seen on Amazon . You have been warned .  
1	  While the drive itself appears to be fine , the cheap 28 gauge USB cable that ships with the unit is insufficient to properly power the device . I attached this unit to 3 types of laptops , 2 types of desktops and 2 types of servers and it did not work on any of them . When I replaced the cable with a Y-cable or a lower gauge cable , it works fine . The problem is that the device draws too much power from the USB hub and the cheap cable cannot handle it . Calls to Western Digital were met with " You can purchase an alternate cable . " That is ridiculous . The unit should ship with a suffiecient cable to power itself .  
1	  I will never buy nothing from this seller again . the digital camara i bought in 2007 only last me 3 months , and took a good care of it . it a very cheap digital camara . dont waste your money buying this garbage camera . so dissapointed .  
1	  The mouse is an antique . Too many cables . How do they still sell it ? They should sell it for $ 0.50 .  
2	  I bought this for my husband for Christmas along with an auto trash holder and it is being used every day .. it 's definitely worth the money !  
1	  I purchased the Sentry HO2.1 headphones a week ago . Beside the fact that it requires batteries to work , they seem like a great deal . The problem : The set that I have are picking-up radio interference . As soon as I turn it on and plug into a device I can hear the same radio station clear as a bell . The strange thing is I don't even have to plug it into a device ; I can just touch the metal contact of the cord to most large metal objects in the house and listen to this one radio station ! I think its some manufacturing defect causing these headphones to behave as a simple bandpass filter and since it has its own power source it just amplifies the interference . Regardless of the cause , it is an extremely annoying problem since no mater what I 'm listening to there is always faint gospel music playing in the background ! Folks I kid you not . I am willing to accept that this is a defect only in the pair that I have , though I would not bet on it .  
1	  Sorry to say mouse didn't work right , it would lockup at any time and also run the batteries down when not in use . I had to return the product which was suprisingly easy .  
1	  Tick , tick , tick , tick , tick .. it will get you too ! It lurks within . The dreaded H07 ( after four years ) finally struck my Panasonic down . Based on the dozens of messages below , there is no recourse . Thus , I 'm taking a hammer to it this evening - should be fun ! If you own one , it 's only a matter of time . If you just bought one - take it back ! Run to the store ! Panasonic is laughing at you .  
2	  After going through a few of those " free with the computer " type printers I finally bit the bullet and bought this Brother printer about 5 years ago . I love it . I have never had a problem with it and I got it up and running in a flash . I liked it so much that I bought a second one to have at my other home . The only reason I thought to finally do a review was that I was searching for where to buy toner for my oldest Brother printer . I can't recommend it highly enough . It 's so great - and so rare - to own any electronic device that doesn't get outdated in a few months , isn't quirky , performs perfectly and is easy to use . If you 're considering a b / w laser printer , you won't go wrong with this one .  
2	  I have had a lot of good reviews from people who have used Sangean products in the past , so I decided to go for a SG 622 . The radio is great and the broadcast reception both SW and FM from stations is terrific . BBC and Voice of America . I cannot afford cable news so a radio does well for my needs . I am here in ABU DHABI , UNITED ARAB EMIRATES , MIDDLE EAST . The cost here is around US$23 / = and is available in most shops . I think the price also makes a good and quality gift .  
2	  If you need microsoft points , it 's just easier to come here . It was quick and I had the points on my xBox within minutes .  
2	  I have this mouse and it works great ! I had ordered it before I saw the reviews , and I was worried . But I got it home and haven't had a bit of problem with it . I don't have to re-sync it all the time either . It 's a really great value for the money !  
2	  I live in Italy and have used this bad boy to get around Italy , Germany , Austria , and Holland with no problems . When visiting Venice , I used this Garmin to help navigate through the walking streets / alleys to find our way back to the train station . Every once in awhile it likes to try to get me to take a road that 's one-way or for bikes only , but no GPS product is perfect . This one gets the job done and I haven't been lost in Europe since I 've owned it .  
1	  I also have the very annoying chirping sound in the audio on most channels . Unacceptable . I 'll be returning this TV today .  
1	  This is the worst scanner . I constantly have problems with it reading documents and please , don't tell me it 's my computer , it isn't . It 's not too bad with photos but certainly not the quality you 'd expect . The support , is there support ? I 've never had a response to any of my inquiries . All in all I would never purchase another one .  
1	  The phone and cable installer told me this would save us from having to drape wire around out house . I assume it must work in some instances . In our case , it would work enough to get a dial tone sometimes but never enough to actually send a fax . We spent HOURS AND HOURS trying to troubleshoot , only to pay to have the installer come back ( when it would have been included if we 'd just done it at the time . Now AMAZON says it 's too late to return it . AARRGGHHAA !  
2	  I received this hub yesterday ; and although I haven't had a long time to use it , I believe it will be the perfect USB hub for me . I currently have my keyboard & iPhone 3G dock plugged into the connections on the back . I prefer to leave my printer hooked up to it 's own USB hub on my iMac . This leaves an open USB port on my iMac for one of my backup drives that I use ( in addition to the two I have attached to the firewire ports . ) This arrangement seems to work flawlessly . I am very pleased with this hub for a couple of reasons . The two top USB connections are very handy for connecting temporary items , such as my digital camera card reader , headphones , etc . Also , it is very small and has enough weight to sit squarely on my desk . One thing I should mention that I don't believe is very clear from the description of this item . THIS IS A POWERED USB HUB . It doesn't have to be , so you can use it with a notebook without power . However , I do have the power adapter plugged in . I figure " why not " since I 'm using it with an iMac . VERY PLEASED so far ; and I doubt that a Belkin product will prove to be faulty at a later date .  
2	  They work really well but offer very little bass . I am no bass junkie , I listen to rock usually , but I was pretty disappointed after reading a few reviews on these headphones regarding the bass that they supposedly offered . Dont get me wrong they are really comfortable and come with lots of ear fitting to ensure a great fit . The cable is nice and thick and jogging in them is great . I should have bought the new Bose because the sound is a bit more three dimensional ..  
1	  Despite other reviews , I find these headphones have very bad sound quality . Everything else is ok ! But .. What is with the bass dominant sound ? I spent hours to balance the bass with the equalizer with no success . At the end I gave up and use my buck cost earbuds with better sound quality . Doesn't worth to return . Trash ..  
2	  I bought this joystick , along with Flight Simulator X , after I attended a summer camp at a local museum and realized how much flight sims were . After searching Amazon , I found the joystick and throttle set they used : the Thrustmaster Cougar , and it cost a whopping $ 186 . Needless to say , I went with the Logitech joystick . I 'm quite impressed with it . The buttons are very ' clicky ' , and it does feel a little cheap , but you get what you pay for . Also , I wish the throttle had more friction , but it 's not a big problem . Flight Simulator X auto-configured it when I plugged it in , no drivers required . Highly recommended if you want a good , cheap joystick . Also , props to Amazon for getting it here so fast . I ordered it Sunday and it got here early on Tuesday . And that isn't with Two-Day Shipping , that 's with FREE Super Saver Shipping . :D  
1	  I regret buying this product since day1 u have to reboot it again and again and now atlast after 6 months only it died on me .  
1	  This camera took great pictures for a P & S ; , and the compact size was great for portability . Unfortunately I experienced the same " lens error " as many others . Normally one would simply send it back to the manufacturer and they would cover the cost of defect , but Canon has not decided to do so - meaning you 'll spend more than the camera is worth to get it fixed . The lens error is a well-known and well-documented problem with these cameras and a number of other Canons that use the same lens . Being a geek , I took it apart and found that two gears were binding together and made one break off its rotating shaft . Unfortunately no fix , and simply a symptom of its own design - though I imagine getting any sort of dirt or sand in the area would immediately make it bind and snap as well , so be careful of that when considering this camera . Overall , great picture quality for a point-and-shoot with fantastic color where other cameras struggle ( for example , a sunset ) . The Achilles heel of this gadget is the " lens error " .  
1	  My wife and I * really * loved this unit . It looks good , it was relatively easy to install , fit nicely under the dash and it was very easy to use . But we ended up sending it back . It seems to have an issue with heat . We live in Southern California and it seems that every two to three weeks or so , we 'd get the " white screen of death " : just a blank white screen , sometimes with an odd warning tone or sometimes completely without the tones you 'd normally get when it powers up . And when the ignition was turned off , the unit would stay illuminated and not power down as it should . The only solution to this ( after two calls to Parrot and another to Crutchfield ) seems to be to pull apart the dash and reseat all the connections on the main controller , as well as the cable connection on the back of the display . Kind of a pain in the you know what in my wife 's Honda . Add to that having to enter the security code on the radio ( I now have it memorized ! ) and reset all the stations ( those too ! ) . I 've now done it at least six times and I 'm tired . We considered getting a replacement unit , but we have read other reports of heat induced failures on the internet and didn't want to go through the replacement process only to have this keep happening . And I hear the 3200 suffers from similar problems . I also have to say that Parrot support is less than stellar . At one point I had to leave a message because no one was available and I waited for a call back for a week . I sent additional eMails with no response . I finally had to call them again and got an answer to my question . This is not the only lackluster experience I 've had with them . We had issues with another underperforming Parrot product as well and had about the same level of service . So , if you are considering buying this , think about where you live and if it * ever * gets hot - even in the summer . Or , for that matter , if the inside of your car ever gets really hot . You might end up going through what we did . I wish I could say otherwise , because this * seems * to have everything you could possibly want in an aftermarket hands-free device . But I can't . MF  
2	  These binoculars are great buy ! Our family has two pairs of the 8x42 ( and one pair of the 10x42 . ) I use them for watching birds . They produce a very crisp , clear image with bright colors . They are fairly heavy , and are made with solid construction . They also come with a comfy neck strap and case . I would highly recommend these binoculars for anyone interested in quality optics at a good price .  
2	  I have purchased and used Mac 's including Classic , LC II , Performa 6220 , 6100 , G3 Desktop , Imac G4 , and now this G5 Imac . This is by far the best Mac and I would highly recommend it . In all these years of surfing the net , I have never had a Virus or major problem . So if you are tired of crashes and reinstalling software , this is the time , and this is the Mac to buy .  
2	  easy to peal , nice stickers , stick nicely , and stay for long , the great thing that they are transparent cause some stickers are not !  
2	  I 'm a pro photographer and tried all kinds filters ( Hoya , Tiffen , Lee etc . ) Then I bought this book and Cokin filters . Well let me tell you something , 1 ) Big choice of filters , 2 ) Lots of accessories , 3 ) One system fits all lenses you have . 4 ) I personally use it for wedding photography . 5 ) Easy to read and see actual examples in this book . Very good book-guide for beginners or pros .  
1	  They must b / c I don't know how they 're all so happy with it . I 'm not going to write a long diatribe here , but I want to caution potential buyers of the e270 . For starters , it 's NOT compatible with Napster To Go nor Y ! Music Unlimited To Go subscription-based services . It is compatible with Rhapsody , but set up is difficult and you MUST HAVE USB 2.0 on your computer . The MTC protocol ( see , I told you it is difficult . . . and I 'm not that technologically savvy ) only works with USB 2.0 , not 1.1 , which I have . Also , it scratches way easily . If you do purchase this product then get a cover for it . The controls are sluggish in terms of moving from one song to the next , but the scroll wheel is pretty cool . I also wish the sound output and the bass response were better . The bass is a little flat for my taste and when you 're in the gym or on a plane , you can hear all sorts of backround noise b / c it isn't loud enough . ( And yes , I went ahead and purchased the Shure earphones for $ 150 and I 'm still not pleased with the sound performance ) . I can't totally trash the player , although I 'm super dissapointed with it . . . especially in light of how much money I spent on it . Customer Support has been great . Quick and responsive . The player design is cool . It 's small , but not to tiny so that the controls are difficult to operate . The scroll wheel is cool and the graphic display is bright and cool looking . Overall , if you 're looking for a player that 's compatible with all of the music to go , subscription-based services , look further than the e270 . If you are cool with paying per song , go with the Nano and itunes . Oh , and who cares about the expansion slot . 6GBs are enough .  
2	  Solid and well built case . I use this case for storing high end folding knives . Very pleased with the product 's fit and finish . Case can be locked up and secured to keep away from and protect children as well as anti theft purposes . So far , so good .  
1	  Buying this RAM cost me an hour of my life .. that I 'll sadly never get back . One of the two 1GB sticks was shot ( my PC failed to boot with it installed ) . Clearly Corsair isn't big on quality control . It took me a bit to isolate which chip was bad , then I noticed the remaining chip appeared to be running at 667MHz not 800MHz . I really didn't get into trouble-shooting this as , given the DOA chip ; I knew they were both going back . NOTE : To the reviewer who suggested bad Corsair chips were due styrofoam peanut packaging .. mine were shipped out peanut free with no other likely source of static . I 'm also extremely careful about ESD and wear a strap every time I open up a PC . I 'm convinced this thing really was DOA . And , it 's not like I 'm the only one here .. a good number of the reviews talk about these chips showing up dead . I should have saved myself the hassle and paid ( literally ) $ 6 more for better memory ( which I 've now done , Dell part # A0821575 ) .  
1	  It says that it 's USB 2.0 and confirmed by a sticker on it which says the same , haha . However when I plug it into my macbook pro with an ipod it tells me " The ipod is connected to a low-speed USB 1.1 port . For better performance you should connect it to a high-speed USB 2.0 port , .. " Also , if I go to the system profiler , my old 2.0 hub has this information : speed up to 480 Mb / sec . This hub says : Up to 12 Mb / sec . I think we can be certain that this is a USB 1.1 hub - Now I 'm wondering how I can get my $ back -  
1	  Got this model with an all new system but it never worked . The first one only produced a greenish pixel page regardless of what was scanned . After fighting with Compaq they sent a replacement which only produces barcodes regardless of what was scanned . Tried their updated drivers but those worked worse than the originals which froze my system six times during install alone . I was forced to do a system restore in the end after working through a crippled OS to try and remove the drivers . Actually the number two worst experience I 've ever had with any computer system or component . Still trying to get Compaq to honor their warranty .  
1	  I bought this USB to connect a computer to a project . Tried many , many times to get it to work , it never worked . Substituting with a shorter USB cable and the shorter cable worked just fine . So the conclusion is that this cable was DOA . I decided not to return it because it was cheap enough to count as loss .  
1	  I like the idea of the product . However , maybe I am missing something here , I could not get two of the seven buttons to work . They are the " Play List Song Select " and " Play List Random " buttons . I 've read the manual and searched Scosche 's website and could not find a solution . The basic functions of the other five buttons do work . These are the Volume Up and Down , Track Forward and Backward , and Pause / Play / Sleep buttons . However , I could not do " press and hold " to move forward or backward within a track . According to the manual these should work . Also , from my remote although I could put my iPod to sleep , I could not do the reverse action of waking it up .  
2	  This is a great and easy to use MP3 player . I only had problems getting playlist files to sync with it .  
2	  Really slick solution , if all you have to worry about are micro SD cards . I have a cell phone / pda that uses these and have several for various applications and data . This is the ideal solution . Small so you can use both USB ports on a laptop , works just like a thumb drive , runs at USB 2 speeds , and allows a quick mulipurpose memory solution .  
1	  Have had an Olympus 4.0M . for 4 years and been very happy with it . As a gift I got this Canon and was very diappointed in the color quality and sharpness . Shot about 600 pictures people were blurred , not crisp and dim even on a sunny day . Had to return it . Don't buy  
1	  Item requires a phone provider server password even if server does not , therefore won't function . Can't work around the server password requirement , according to D-Link customer service . Because my rural phone provider , TDS Telecom , omits the need for a server password , this DSL router-modem is unusable , and not only that , can't be returned , because the box was opened and the item was used .  
2	  The ends took a little longer to get as one set was shipped from another supplier , but they are excellent quality and I will buy more if I get another set of wires that require them .  
1	  This CD player wont work in the car , it wont work when I 'm sitting on the train at times because of the slight vibration , it hardly works when I 'm walking , in general , it should only be used if your going to leave it on a table or something flat and never touch it while it 's in play mode . The bass boost makes everything sound distorted , the anti-shock is a total joke , and on top of everything , it 's bigger and heavier then the average portable CD player . My advice to you , buy this item for someone you want to avoid for the rest of your life .  
2	  First of all , I 've read a number of reviews for this unit that mention some issue with laser pickup functionality loss over 1 year of use . In response to this , I have to ask , " what in God 's green earth are you doing to your DVD players ? " If your laser pickups are failing after a year , maybe you should stop keeping your DVD player on a unit / table / slab next to your subwoofer . No subwoofer ? Then stop throwing it around the house like a frisbee . I 've had this unit for at least 3 years now , and I have not experienced a single loss in quality . I use it daily for DVD production , and I 've given it a number of discs ( from a well-produced Hollywood release to my crapped-out test productions to scratched Whitesnake CDs ) all of which , it 's read properly , and without failure . This player is a bad-ass , yes , but it 's not tuned to take the severe beating some of the reviewers have given it . Ignore the 1-star reviews on here ( because I said so ) and buy this puppy .  
1	  This item was ordered in April . My American Express account has been charged for the full price of the item . As of May 31 , it has not been received . This is very bad service  
1	  I had this microphone for a long time and I loved it . Until I was on Skype and my friend told me to get closer to my microphone , because he can't hear me well . Then I realized that my microphone was not even turned on ! Once I turned it on , the volume was of course normal . But this incident showed me that you can't trust this microphone . If you turn it off , the volume will lower , that 's all . I confirmed the problem with the Sound Recorder app . It 's unbelievable , but true ! Please try it yourself and then help to spread the word !  
2	  I am pleased to find the plug in adapter on Amazon . They are difficult to find in the shops , and I will be needing one on my trip to Scotland . It arrived in the packaging and in mint condition and in enough time before my trip . I am very pleased with the product and love Amazon ! Thank you for being there . My shopping is somewhat limited because I don't have a car . But with Amazon , I need not worry . They have everything I would need . And I am always treated with respect .  
2	  I have both the HP TC1100 and a Toshiba M400 Tablet PC 's but I really don't like the included stylus with either for drawing or writing . The Cross Executive Pen has the hallmark weight and solid feel of a decent ink pen with nice nubs that foster a more natural drawing or note-taking session . I 'm very fond of the pens button design because , unlike the HP 's default stylus , there is rarely an accidental press that disrupts the state of concentration one falls into when drawing . As many have mentioned , the cap option should be avoided because the cap tends to be tight enough that you can literally break the stylus when removing . There is also the issue of why someone needs a cap on a stylus since you have no cause to worry about dried ink ..  
1	  I bought this mouse as part of the wireless desktop 2 . I 'm extremely happy with my new keyboard but i really hate this mouse . it 's bulky , it 's slow and the middle mouse button requires actuall pressure until you here a click for it to work properly . I will finish saying that the tilt feature is probably the most useless gimmick ever . I love microsoft mice i always had a microsoft mouse and my favorite one is still the blue optical USB one . I prefer a mouse that fits comfortably in my hand and feels like a natural extension . no matter how much time i gave this WOM2 it still feels like an uncomfortable piece of junk .  
1	  This seems to be a good product , if you are using Windows XP . It worked well on my XP machine on my home network , but wouldn't work on my machines using Windows ME or Windows Vista . I learned this sad fact after spending too much of my time with D-Link Tech Support . Fortunately , Amazon refunded my money and paid for the return freight . After returning the D-Link DP-301P + , I used a Hawking HPS1P Print Server for my Windows Vista and Windows XP machines , and upgraded my ME to XP , which works well . The Hawking HPS1P doesn't support Windows ME either , unless you are willing to downgrade the firmware , which probably won't work for Vista applications .  
2	  I ordered my TV over the holidays . Delivery was perfect using Eagle and the set had no problems . Picture on both HD and 480i is beautiful . Using with a Sony upconvert DVD player with it which again provides a beautiful picture . Monitor converts flawlessly between video modes . Wide button on remote very handy for dealing with programs running on HD channels which are not in widescreen formatAlso have this hooked up to my laptop running at 1920 x 1080 resolution . Again , picture looks awesom . Don't regret order at all .  
2	  Delivery was prompt and everythings appears to work properly . Haven't managed to geet all my shows recorded on schedule yet , but that is not a problem of the device .  
2	  Just , Wow I had no idea this wonderful product was out here . I bought mine locally at my camera shop . This is the fastest and safest way to clean a camera lens to date . I bought a used lens in need of some TLC . This product did the job and quickly . I highly suggest this product to anyone .  
2	  This mount worked perfectly for our 23 " HDTV in our nursery . Very sturdy and heavy . All required hardware was included .  
1	  500-1000 shots for an authentic Canon battery is not good which leads me to believe this is a fake . My Canon battery that came with my 20D would get me at least 1200-1500 shots at a wedding even after using it for 6 years and still have power left over . Unfortunately another photographer whom I was working an event at in Schaumburg stole mine while I had it charging and stuck his cheap knock off battery in my charger . Protect your authentic Canon batteries because they are worth every penny !  
2	  When choosing a camera I specifically chose the Kodak EasyShare because of the availability of this dock . It makes transfering pictures to my PC so easy .. no fumbling with cords and / or plugs . Just set the camera on the dock , push one button and the pictures transfer . Can't get any more user-friendly than that ! Great product !  
2	  Bandwidth on DSL is not enough ( ~ 5Mbps / ~ 1Mbps ) .. so I thought to add Wireless access as ClearWire service is available in my area . Unfortunately , Clearwire is also not that fast .. but additively , it would be much better . After much research on performance , features and cost , I chose this Dual-WAN router to solve my speed issues . I have been using it for several months now . It allows load-balancing based on traffic type , source IP address , destination IP address , and automatically on the internet traffic based on the declared WAN bandwidth values and the loads of each interface . It also has OpenVPN support , which I intend to use in the future . It is manageable from both firefox and internet exploder , but its numerous configuration options create lots of complexity which is suitable only for experienced network people . While this is not the most complex router in the industry , it does serve it intended purpose well and I would recommend it to anyone who is experienced with networking and who wants Dual-WAN access for redundancy , additive speed , or manageability from a single router .  
2	  The Block Rocker is Awesome . I used it with a cordless microphone and an ipod . Great volume and well mixed sound . The long lasting battery is also a hit . Go Block Rocker .  
2	  There are some really long write ups , so I will keep mine short and sweet . I bought this to back up my iTunes and iPhotos via firewire . Since my older Mac doesn't support USB 2.0 firewire was a must . If I backed up my music and photos via USB 1.0 it would take over 24 hours . I have owned this over a year . It has been reliable . It does heat up and makes some high speed spinning sounds at times , but nothing too unusual . You should be able to buy with confidence . So far , so good .  
1	  I wish I hadn't bought this router . I spent eight hours trying to get it to work but couldn't . The * tech * support at d-link was exceptionally bad ( as is noted by many other reviewers ) . In the end they told me I had correctly configured it and it must be defective . Follow up ( two days later ) . I spent another couple of hours trying to get it to work and I glad I did it because a replacement wouldn't have helped . It turns out that the problem lies in the router firmware v . 1.21 . It turns out that in some instances You * must * use the router 's virtual server to forward ports . The firmware supports direct port forwarding , but direct doesn't work under some scenarios . The only default setting I changed was the router IP ( changed from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.1.1 ) and I also reserved two IPs . I 'm still leaving my rating as a 1 . The router is working , but this issue seems to indicate that the firmware wasn't thoroughly regression tested ( checked under a wide variety of settings ) .  
2	  I was verry peased with the camera ! This is the second camera I had bought from this site and would not hessitate to buy again !  
1	  I have 3 of these units . Within a short time , two of the power supplies have gone bad . The first symptom was that the drives were suddenly dismounting randomly . Finally the computer would not recognize the drives at all . Swapping the power cables with the remaining good one did make the drive function properly again . Unfortunately , having to constantly order replacement power cables ( at around $ 20 each or so ) was not part of the deal . So avoid this product .  
1	  Have not use this item yet . Expected to recieve item that was not included , ( also not listed ) not the fault of the sender . Without said item ( car charger ) unit is somewhat useless to me .  
2	  This thing is amazing as far as storage capacity . I just bought a new canon camera a month ago , and I 'm still taking pictures and videos .. without having to empty the card . On the downside .. there aren't very many products that I 'm aware of , that can read this card . My next purchase is a card reader so hopefully I 'll be able to access my pictures easily .  
2	  I bought these for the cost and functionality and have been quite happy with both . Over a year later they still function just fine !  
2	  I paired this sub with the yamaha 6490'sThis sub is deep defined and natural sounding . In my opinion it is the best sounding sub at this price point . I simply dont agree with the folks that rate this as a home theater only sub . I listen to an ecceltic mix of music and i particularly appreciate the accuracy and realism when i play jazz . I could go on and on as this sub amazes me everytime i listen to it . Oh yeah .. jayzee and fity rock on this thing ! If you 're looking for a very versital , musical sub at a ridiculasly modest price , get this ! Oh , its very well built and attractive too .  
1	  This player has serious problems with audio going out of sync on non disc video files . I bought THE player exclusively for playing back stuff like AVI and MKV only to realize that 9 out of 10 of my videos had sync problem that do not occur when playing back on the PC . It functions well enough as a DVD / Bluray player , but not much else . Samsung support did not return my email about the issue and the latest firmware doesn't fix the issue . I would not recommend this player .  
2	  I was looking for a minimalistic laptop bag and I love this one . It 's very protective , I 've owned many Crumpler camera cases that have held up so well to the abuse I put it through and this bag is no different . The velcro sticks well and is very secure . I put my brand new MacBook Pro 15 " along with numerous folders , mini notebook , power supply , calculator , apple . It holds more than it looks like it should hold . My dog has stepped and sat on my bag in the front seat - not to my liking and my laptop is just fine . Whew .  
1	  Got rid of the cannon printer because it was not an all in one , and actually I did have a problem with Cannons ink cartridges and they said it was my machine .. I said ok and got rid of the problem and boughjt an Epson , great machine love it  
2	  I loved these speakers . They were loud and the bass really boomed . It was because of these speakers that we quit using a separate stereo system all together . Hooked to our computer we had a much larger selection of music to chose from . I would be using these to this day if the volume control didn't quit working . Unfortunately without that piece the whole system is useless . They did last almost seven years though so it was money well spent .  
2	  I have been using this mouse for about 6 years now . It prevents wrist pain more that any other mouse I have used . I have ordered it for others in my department and they seem to like it also . Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman ( USB / PS / 2 )  
2	  I know many people say that the canon 's are the best , but I have found that for the money and simplicity the sony 's are the best bet . I would suggest however that if you can take dealing with a bigger camera you should buy it . The smaller these camera 's get the more they struggle to keep the image quality up . Many think that just because of the higher megapixel ability the image will be higher quality . That is not the case . The lense on a small camera can't keep up . The Carl Zeiss lens with Sony however does a good job , but it can't compete with a bigger camera of similar quality .  
1	  I just spent 3 hours with tech support and was finally informed that this unit is not supported by XP SP3 . They are working on compatibility problems with another product , thus this is not on the current queue for upgrade . EXTREMELY disappointing support from a company such as cisco .  
1	  I was told by a videography producer in the industry that one of the first things I should buy when starting my videography business is a Pro Mist lens . He said that it helps to give a " film look " , kind of the same look as putting a nylon panty hose over the lens . So I went out and bought this 80 sum dollar lens just because of the advice I was given . BUT - Each time I used it , I did NOT like the picture . I do church filmings , weddings , events , interview segments .. and it looks horrible - not clear , it doesn't look professional at all . If you want the " film look " - I reccommend buying a camera that shoots in 24 frames instead of the 30 frames like most consumer cameras do . For my purposes , it was NOT worth the money .. I try to incorperate in my filmings .. but I end up taking it off because it never looks good . I did a filming of a bride getting ready - so I filmed some with it on / some with it off . With this lens on - made my footage look out-of-focus and like I didn't know how to film . I cringe when I see the footage of the pro mist filter . I 'm sure this lens would be good for abstract / creative photography , or those " glamour shots " but I don't reccommend it for filming .  
2	  I purchased the Magellan Maestro 3100 four weeks ago . It is amazing . Does exactly as advertised , I will not go anywhere without it .  
1	  I couldn't get it to work . Had to return it . I had bought it for the priority it gave to streaming video ( I have a ROKU so I stream a lot ) . It looked nice , came on time , but I could never get it to connect to the internet . I had to return it and I got a netgear instead , which has worked great .  
1	  Dell is giving away these printers and they would make good gifts for young children if you don't mind paying for cartridges . It is useless for anything where you want black ink , like photos or letters . As the other reviewer stated , black text and graphics print green . I didn't find this out until I contacted " Mukta " from Dell tech support to troubleshoot the problem . Dell should be ashamed of themselves for selling these cartridges as " color ( black also ) " . It is a blatant lie .  
2	  Like one of the over reviewers , I am an artist . I was looking for a printer that could do a decent job printing my portfolio book which I pass around to galleries and buyers . The printer is great ! I print on premium glossy photo paper using the photo setting at high resolution . You just have to make sure to go through the print setup menu to make sure you have the right settings . The default is " text draft " on plain paper . Like all of the instructions say , making sure you have the right paper selected makes all the difference . It is simple to use , setup and work with . So far so good !  
1	  Pros - Very cool design . Nice feel to the Zune . Cons - Battery Life is very low on mine for some reason . Its bigger than my iPod video . The sharing thing that thay are advertising so much is not all that . You can only listen to your shared song 3 times in 3 days . Thats not sharing at all ! They should call it a sample from your friends . Other than that I should have went ahead and bought another iPod . Additional Thoughts - Not ready for the market yet . The software is a PAIN to install . And the sharing with other people is really a joke . It still does not give you the control that you should have over your own media . Good idea though .  
1	  Sangean radio . So far I like it very much . The sound quality is excellent , as is the base enhancement feature . I 'm learning slowly to set the memory function . So far , so good ! I tend to be technologically challenged , but am persistent ! Frances VandervoortChicago  
1	  The " remove tape " issue and damage to tapes started in less then two years . We spent $ 1000 for this camera for two years , you can buy two camera 's for that cost now with the same features . I wish we would have read the reviews before buying . It was a nice camera when it was new thats why it gets 1-star from me and not 0-stars .  
1	  I concur with the previous reviewer 's points that the device 's weight and ports arrangement make the hub seem cheap and limit it 's usage . I 'll add that Belkin has misleading advertising for the product and that I recieved rather poor customer service from them . First off , the hub functioned , but not until I plugged the AC adapter in . I have a basic MS optical mouse , a Lexus Jump Drive , a digital camera and an SD card reader . None of them work with the hub unplugged . I 'm 0 for 4 , even though ' most devices work without power supply ' .. Second , after I plugged the hub into one of my rear USB ports , the other went dead . Since I 've decided I didn't want to use this piece of junk , I 've been unable to plug any of the other devices directly into either of my PC USB ports anymore . These other devices work when going through the powered hub ( or the new drive bay ports ) , but not otherwise . I emailed Belkin and they responded by telling me to call the helpline . After 10-15 minutes on hold , the CSR had me plugging and unplugging things for another 15 minutes until he drew the conclusion that " our device is working properly , contact your PC manufaturer to find out what 's wrong with the PC " . A half hour on the phone to determine the problem was what I originally described in my email .. I have no idea if the technical fault is with the hub or the motherboard , but I 've used the USB ports for over 2 years without a hint of trouble until I plugged the TetraHub into them . BTW , I eventually found a drive-bay hub that plugged directly into the motherboard and suited my needs perfectly for half the price . I 'm not sure what could make the TetraHub worth the price , even if it didn't have problems , unless you have some affinity to pretty lights ..  
1	  The camera resolution would be good if the Rightlight 2 didn't make the image so dark , even with lights on . I called Logitech but was on hold forever . When they gave me the option to leave a call back number , they never called back . I returned this product and got the Logitech Communicate CTX instead . Lower resolution , but it uses Rightlight 1 which actually seems to work . One would think if Rightlight 2 didn't work , they would not push that for any of their camcorders . But I would recommend avoiding any logitech cams that use Rightlight 2 until some one actually says they fixed the bug . Sometimes more expensive is not better .  
2	  The case works well for SD1400 . The case is a bit snug for the SD1400 but works nonetheless . The magnet clasp is sufficient to hold the case closed , even when the wrist lanyard is sticking out of it . it should protect the camera very well , but it is quite large ( about twice the thickness of the camera ) . I have went with something thinner and made mostly of fabric , like a small camera bag .  
1	  Four problems : ( 1 ) the product did not include the 9-to-25-pin adapter shown in the picture ; ( 2 ) the included driver did not work , though one downloaded from the manufacturer 's web site did ; ( 3 ) I paid for next-day service but waited about one week for shipment ; ( 4 ) the product has integral female-threaded bolts that prevent use unless the mating DB-9 female adapter is flush with its mounting surface . The unit with which I wanted to communicate it also has projecting female-threaded bolts projecting from its mounting surface . Hmm . Removing the bolts from my unit loosens its DB-9 connector so that 's no go . And , it doesn't appear possible to non-destructively remove the bolts from the product . So , in my application , a DB-9 male-female adapter was required . I don't expect to have to purchase an adapter in order to use an adapter .  
2	  The pictures I took were as good as the ones I took with the more expensive canon lens . I 'll l recommennd this lens to all my friends amateur photograhers looking to supplement the 18-55 lens that comes standard in Nikon and Canon Cameras .  
1	  Ok , I had owned a Garmin 45XL & It lasted 10 years ! Wow ! So , I knew I was going to buy a new Garmin . Just what Unit ? After all my research I got the Garmin map 60cs . It sure is nice to have your maps in your GPS & not on paper . 56 MB of memory is great ! The battery life was around 18 hours ( 2 AA batteries ) Very good ! I love the electronic compass , Need not move to get your compass reading . :-) Love the highway tracking & routes & the way it promts you to turn ! cool .. & off road , Most of the areas I hunt will fit all @ once on this unit . with the base map still on the unit . I also got the MapSource United States Topo ! The Only fall backs on this unit are no expandable memory ! But , 56 MB will do for now . The other fall back is that the Topo mapsource only comes in 1:100,000 scale .. Needs to be 1:124,000 scale .. maybe in the future ! Over all it 's a great unit for hunting & getting around town .  
2	  I think this is great . I live with two roommates and bought this so I could watch TV in my room without needing to crank the volume up which would have bothered my roommates . Now I can watch TV whether I 'm sitting two feet away or laying in bed which is about 9 feet away .  
1	  I bought this camera thinking it would exceed the performance of my sony DSC-P10 . The only one taht can do this is the DSC-V3 . All pictures taken with the DSC-S500 are blurry / low quality even at 6MP . The DSC-P10 is a much better camera even though it is much older than the S500 and even though they both have a Sony lens , not a Carl Zeiss . Don't buy the S series . Since the P series and the V series are no longer available , go for the W series ; the W30 is cheap and very good .  
2	  Having typed for over 50 years , I knew this would be a different experience because this keyboard breaks the mold to what I am usually & # 34 ; typing & # 34 ; on . Now that I have had it for a few weeks my fingers feel like they are home , no more strain on them or my hands and wrists . All the buttons on top make life much more user friendly .  
2	  The cable does exactly what it is supposed to do . I have used it to connect both a printer and external hard drive and both work flawlessly . My only complaint is that the picture is of a BLACK cable and the one that i received was offwhite . Considering the price , i dont mind whatsoever .  
2	  Easy , reliable use , super-bright picture ( with the BenQ MP610 DLP projector ) . Built tough ; survived a nasty drop to the floor ( one end , then the other - long story ) , without any noticeable damage whatsoever . Xlnt deal .  
1	  This pool is almost impossible to set up completely . Your yard must be 100 % level ! The wrinkles in the liner are impossible to remove . The replacement parts are non existent ( I have been trying to find a pump for days now ) . Today it has sprung a leak in the most unusual place . ..  
1	  I purchased a RipFlash Plus 256 MP3 player / recorder in June 2004 to record voice interviews . Major flaws in its construction and in its download software mean you are very likely to lose your recordings . To make matters worse , customer support is very resistant to issuing refunds for faulty equipment . - It produces decent sound quality , though the recordings have a constant low-level hum in the background . Two main problems with the unit make it very problematic for capturing recordings : 1 ) The software provided ( and required ) to download the sound files to computer over USB is very flakey - sometimes it works , sometimes does not connect , sometimes downloads only part of the sound file but indicates it is " done . " This happens on both of the newer Dell computers that I 've tried it on . By contrast , all other devices I attach to the USB ports on these same computers exchange files flawlessly . 2 ) The RipFlash Plus is able to hold a SmartMedia card and record to it . This would seem to be an alternative to downloading through the USB connection - just remove the SmartMedia card , insert it into your computers card reader , and copy off the files . BUT . . . the ejector button on the RipFlash broke the second time I ejected a card , and appears likely to break on any unit . The ejector button pushes the card out with two very tiny brittle plastic tabs . It takes almost nothing to break one ( in my case , just ejecting the card did it . ) Then , you can't get the card out , or if you do fish it out , you can no longer position it in correctly without the button in place . Regarding customer support . . . when the unit arrived in the mail , I discovered that they had thrown in a " voice activated TV remote " - at no charge , and without any advance notice - a device they don't sell on their site . I can't imagine anything more useless than that so I tossed it immediately . After obtaining an RMA from them and returning the broken RipFlash , they at first tried to charge me a " restocking " fee for the useless recorder . After I put my credit card company on their case , they finally refunded the full amount . Then , they decided they needed to charge me $ 40 for the throw-away remote that they had sent unsolicited , so they made a new charge on my card for it . You might want to consider the options before you decide to try the RipFlash Plus . Rob  
2	  I got this with my keyboard & it came in very handy . :) Definitely worth the few bucks extra . ALWAYS PROTECT YOUR ELECTRONICS !  
1	  I was driving from Atlanta to Chicago when I was told by my GPS to take a right turn . So I did . I woke up in the New York , New York hospital where they told me I had hit a tree ! Plus in the wreck , my GPS broke when it flew out the window ! This is a waste of $ 2,000 . You could get a good Garmin GPS for $ 200 and it wouldn't make you drive into trees ! By the way , I ended up in New York , not Chicago .  
1	  I have had problems with the auto color adjustment . The gain is always too dark or too bright . I have to set it manually to get the colors right , otherwise , the colors are too intense and not right .  
1	  I bought this styler to get the 3/4 " brush . It " works " fine , but I find it way too difficult to use . Pros : It 's got plenty of power and gets hot . It 's got so much power it might blow your hair off the brush with the high setting . Cons : The brushes on the 3/4 " brush are too long . There 's no quick release , so by the time you get it out of your hair , it can be pulled straight . I cut the brushes down with a scissors and that helped . The barrel is way to big for the average female to hold in her hand - the fatter part is a full 2 " in diameter and the thinner part is over 1.5 " in diameter . I have big hands and even I can barely rotate it to wrap my hair . Before you buy this thing , try holding a piece of 1 1/4 " PVC pipe in your hand and pretend it 's a curling iron . Then , the switch is on the handle and it 's a slider , so while trying to rotate the big barrel in my hand , I kept turning the thing off . This might be OK for heavy , smooth hair , but lighterweight hair just blows around too much .  
2	  I upgraded to this body from the D50 . I was torn between the D80 and the D200 , but after making the purchase , I have absolutley no regrets . The amount of control over settings , and easy use of controls is great ; though there was a learning curve . Pictures are BIG sharp , the 5fps is amazing , and it 's built like a tank .  
1	  I bought two of these . One works great , the other failed out of the box . After trying to figure out why my audio / video receiver wasn't sending a picture to my LCD TV , I checked the cable with an ohm meter - there 's a break in the cable somewhere . You 'll read some reviews that 'll say " it 's just pushing 1 's and 0 's " , that 's true . You have to ask yourself why the electrical cable to your clothes dryer is so much different than the one to your clock radio - " it 's just pushing electricity " :-) Buy these if you want , just remember , there 's a risk associated with the savings .  
2	  Good remote control . I relocated all of my AV ( cable box , blue ray , receiver , 400 cd player ) equipment inside of a cabinet . The remote controls everything flawlessly . Easy to set up , and it cost way less than comparable RF universal remotes .  
2	  I 'm completely satisfied with the camera . I purchased a total of 6 cameras for my siblings who are located throughout the United States and all of the cameras have been working great . I also purchased the Life Cam-6000 and found that it was not worth the money . We use the Skype software with the cameras and the 3000 works great . I would suggest the 3000 over the 6000 if you are using the camera for simple on-line calls .  
1	  Didn't have a lot of luck with this wireless kit . Bought the ISA / PC Card version and couldn't get it to recognize the desktop even when it was only a few feet away . Would have liked to tried it with the PCI card version but two promised call backs and three emails were unanswered by Diamond  
2	  I received the product promptly . I purchased it to replace my 1995 Marble Mouse . The new one works as great as the old one except it has a wheel in the middle instead of another button . You can program the wheel to do different operations . I use it for scrolling . The nice thing about the new one is that you do not have to remove the ball to clean the circuits . It does it automatically .  
1	  Purchased this a month ago and have been rather unhappy with this product , which gives unstable wireless performance . I was attracted to Netgear by the rebate , and now I regret it . I should have bought a Linksys wireless router / AP instead , I think . My wifi-ready laptop is about 50 feet away from the Netgear router . There are about 4 walls in between , and reception is poor . About 20 % of the time it 's fair , 30 % of the time poor , and 50 % of the time ( when I try to use Internet ) it 's unavailable . This performance is just not acceptable . The manual set is also poorly written . You get two pieces of printed materials : a confusing starter sheet , and an ISP information sheet . Get this : on the printed " get started " sheet it asks you to refer to the manual on the CD-ROM before you should turn your PC back on ! What kind of genius wrote this ? Luckily I 'm a techie so I had no trouble deciphering the non-English guide . The router 's major strength is its cool design , but its poor signal strength means you should probably go with a more established brand like Linksys or D-Link .  
2	  This is a good bag to carry a Nikon Digital Camera and one or two SB800 or SB900 Flash units . Not enough room for a second lens , however . Offers excellent protection for Nikon Digital Cameras .  
1	  I would not rate this piece " good " . Still lot of distortions .. So guys go for something else ..  
2	  First of all , I 'm not an audiophile or am not aware if I was one . However , I do listen to a wide variety of music including rock , pop , ( a lot of ) classical , hip hop , so I 'm your normal average Joe . And here 's my short take : Like what everyone 's been saying , the built quality and the sound quality are extremely good ! No complaint in these departments . I did take off one star because of the discomfort . I have average ( if not smaller than average ) head and ears , and these cans are just barely circumaural . The right cup barely fits comfortably over my ear , but the left one does not ( guess how I know my ears have slightly different sizes ? ) . So after about an hour of being pinched , my left ear would become red and irritated , and well , that can certainly distract me from enjoying music . I 'm hoping that after a while , they will loosen up a bit , but as I already have them for about 2 weeks , I don't think there 's much of that , so I 'm considering returning it for another different pair . I 'll give you an update later . To sum up , if you have larger than average ( I 'm curious to know that the official & # 34 ; average & # 34 ; ear size is ) , you will experience discomfort during and after use . I would suggest that you try them out in a store before buying them . I didn't do that and so regetting it .  
2	  Great for the price . And if your looking for a cam for the kids at collage this is my pick of the year ..  
1	  It did not work . This cable is very very thin cable .. maybe 2 or 3mm , if you buy expensive calbe it is very thick like 10mm .. I would not mind as long as it works , but it did not .  
2	  This item will change your life as you no it forever . Be sure to take the blue pill for the best effect .  
2	  My wife and I needed to cut down on the remote situation . I purchased this remote not expecting too much , but ended up being way impressed ! The setup can be a little confusing , but after getting the hang of it it was very easy to set up . It controls EVERYTHING in my house ( I only gave it a 4 because it couldn't Mute my kids ) !  
1	  This item puts out bad sound quality . In my personal auto it is so-so but in my van at work it is horrible . So forget about it .  
2	  I would have given it a five star if I hadn't just tested the Bose . But I don't think anything can compare to the Bose . That being said , even after going back and forth , comparing them , I don't regret my decision . The Bose were super expensive . These were almost as good , and just about as effective . The Bose ear cup sealed better , slightly more comfortable , and you couldn't hear the noise from the cancelling effect at all . It also cancelled noise just a tiny bit better , probably because of the tighter seal . It felt like it was suctioning onto my ear , but didn't hurt . That being said , this one compared to the uber expensive one pretty darn well . I got it for less than a fifth of the price , and they are comfortable , cancel sound extremely well , ( made my first flight with them * much * more pleasant even though I didn't have any music , ) and have pretty darn good sound quality . The biggest difference was the sound quality , I think . I didn't know what I was missing until I listened to the Bose , and when I have disposable income , might even buy a set of the Bose , but these serve their function perfectly . Also , as an added bonus , these , ( but not the Bose ) , will function as headphones when turned off , thus not wasting battery when you don't need to cancel noise and want to have some sense of your surroundings . Though , it 's still pretty hard to hear anything when they 're on , even without the noise cancelling on . They block noise when off even when there 's no music playing , which I think is a sign of good noise isolation . Here 's what you should expect , and what I was pleasantly surprised about : - Noise cancelling noise : In all the noise cancelling headphones I 've ever tried , you can tell when they 're on not because everything 's quiet ( though that 's a factor too ) but because you can * feel * it . In these , when there 's no music , you can also hear it faintly . It feels weird , and it can start to bother me after a while , but they all have it . It 's because of the way noise cancelling works . - Comfort : You want a good tight fit so it seals , but I 'm someone who is used to earbuds . Putting anything * on * my ears was hard to get used to , and it can feel heavy and uncomfortable after a while . That being said , I didn't think these pinched , and they fit pretty well . - Noise cancelling ability : These are meant to cancel ambient noise . I find that they do a better job when you 're stationary , and facing in certain directions , which makes sense considering how the technology works . They are better with lower frequencies ( planes , cars , fans ) , and worse with higher frequencies ( voices ) . So , don't expect to not be able to hear the person talking next to you with these or any noise cancelling headphones . That being said , when I was also playing music , I couldn't hear the person next to me unless I was trying really hard . Me and a friend played around , talking to each other while we had these and the Bose on . When just the noise cancelling ( no music ) was on , then we could hear each other but it was dampened , softer , easier to ignore . With the music on , I could imagine someone talking to me and not knowing it . So , don't expect magic , but do expect very quality noise reduction .  
2	  Bought this product after careful review and don't regret it . Ready to use as soon as you power it up and with easy to follow menus . Offers automatic recalculation of routes which isn't a feature every navigation device on the market offers . Highly recommend to others .  
2	  One of the better ones I 've had . Probably should have spent my money on a car with a less crappy antenna though . This was cheaper than a new car though , so it won .  
1	  This came and I was excited to get my laptop temp . , down . Put it into the USB port and wouldn't work at all . The " Very Bright " blue LED light was showing so I knew it had power . But when I checked ( with a very bright flashlight ) by looking right at the fans , they weren't moving one CM . Could not recommend . Went instead to the Targus Lap Chill Mat AWE55US ( Black with Gray ) , which had many good reviews and it works great . Can see , hear ( very slightly ) but feel the air flowing . Ordered the Targus from Amazon for about $ 10 more but what else could you do with one that didn't work ?  
1	  This printer , from USAprinterguy , nearly burned down the office . The thing shot sparks out of the back on first use and I 'm not plugging it back in so it can fail even worse .  
2	  Got this cam since I am traveling a bit more these days for work and I want to see my family . Bought this for the quality and small travel size . Did not disappoint . The software is a bit useless ( I simply use AIM for video chat ) , as no one usese the Logitech proprietary software . Other than that , it works as advertised . Small , easy to set up , good quality . Recommended if you need a travel web cam .  
2	  Needed a cheap cable for an old monitor - Exactly what I was looking for and works great ! Free shipping and low price too ! Very happy so far .  
2	  Worked exactly as desribed . Fit perfect with absolutely no problems . Made installation a breeze ! 2007 Ford F150 FX2 Sport . Delivery was longer than expected .  
2	  I ordered this for my classroom . It fits our typewriter perfectly , but is too big for all of our classroom computer keyboards ( ours are Dell and Gateway that seem like the " normal " size .. but must run slimmer ) . The product goes on the typewriter keyboard easily and looks like it will last .  
2	  I 've had this radio for over 3 years now and the only problem is with the FM tuner ( it died in less than one year ) . It still works with AM , weather , and TV . Since I use it for primarily AM , it 's not a big deal . Speaking of AM , this has absolutely the best AM reception of any radio I 've had . One last comment : the batteries last quite a while . I use it at least 20 - 30 mintues a day and have only replaced the batteries once in three years . If you 're looking for a shower radio , this is it !  
1	  Do not waste your time . The Tungsten E is almost useless . The set up was terrible . Tech support took 3 calls and hot synch is still not correct . The battery is almost non-existent ; after full charging it will " magically " dissipate without ANY use . Then the fun really begins - ALL my data is then lost - this has happened 4 times in the first 30 days of owning this . Oh yeah - when hot synch does work ( rarely ) it requires COMPLETE resetting of the entire unit ! The Vx I had for 4 yrs was perfect . The Tungsten E gets an E- instead of an F- because the screen lights up nicely ( for a short while ! ) . Heh Palm - get tech support personnel who are willing to take the time and not rush you off the line . I 'll never buy Palm again .  
2	  i dont know how you guys do it , but this cable is so good and so cheap . excellent product .  
2	  I 've purchased ink for the Epson 1270 and found you can't beat original ink cartridges . Amazon has the best prices and free delivery . Refills have never worked very well for me .  
1	  CD Projects used to make some of the best quality disc storage units available . I 've used one of their Roladisc CD holders ( like a rolodex which holds CD sleeves ) for at least five years-I 'm pushing it to its full capacity ( over 100 sleeves , most holding two discs back-to-back ) , and it 's still in great shape . Unfortunately , within the past year or two , CD Projects has changed hands . It shows : the commitment to quality is no longer there . CD Projects pioneered the use of special materials in their sleeves which help protect discs-a practice which , fortunately , is being imitated . But newer products from CD Projects ( i.e. those manufactured after the shakeup ) use sleeves of much lesser quality . I 'll grant that the new sleeves are still better than many offered by the competition , but they 're harder to use ( the discs don't slide in and out as easily ) and less protective . Also , the CD Projects product line has been reduced significantly . Not much selection anymore . For those disappointed that the CD Projects name no longer represents the best , I suggest looking into the Univenture catalog , particularly Unikeep binders . A bit pricey , but it 's now become the best choice .  
2	  I use this cable solely to connect my digital piano ( which has midi inputs and 1/8 " headphone jack ) to my home recording mixer . The signal is clean and allows a great quality recording .  
2	  For you Mac users out there , this is a great printer to hook up to your Airport Express or Extreme . Works without a hitch . I finally replaced my hardwired HP 5MP workhorse with this Brother , and couldn't be happier . It prints pages very , very quickly ( faster than my HP ) , and the price is perfect .  
2	  The system is just what I was looking for . A reliable alarm clock that can plug into my iPod . The x-tra accessories can be a bit overwhelming , but don't be scared off . They sound it great . The volume on the radio alarm is a bit loud for my tastes . But , other than that I am glad I made this purchase . iLuv Electronics I177BLK iPod Speaker System ( Black )  
2	  We were looking for a binocs that would give us close up details from a short distance . Several years ago we watched people viewing butterflies and dragonflies from only a few feet away and wondered what euipment they were using - enter the Papilio . These simple - to-use binocs offer excellant detail . And the price is right , too ! We 're thinking about getting another pair so we don't have to share !  
2	  I bought this radio / cd player for my 4 yr old daughter . Although she 's not a " Barbie " fanatic , she loves the colour and the appearance of the radio . The barbie button that lights up on the top of the cd player is a nice touch too . The sound is a little on the " tinny " side , but still quite good , especially considering the small size and price of the boombox . Most surprising is the impressive sound clarity at higher volumes . Both the cd player and the radio are fairly easy to navigate . The boombox does not have station display , but instead uses a tiny indentation on the tuner dial that you rotate to select stations , which makes it a bit more difficult for youngsters to tune in a station . However , an LED will light up when a station is properly tuned in . The cd player will only play regularly formatted cd 's ( not mp3 or other formats ) . However , there is an auxilary jack that allows you to plug in other music players such as an mp3 player or Ipod . ( This is a great feature for my daughter , who has hundreds of songs loaded onto her mp3 player ) . Overall , a great product and highly recommended .  
1	  THIS THING MESSED UP HALF OF MY FAMILY GUY DISCS . DO NOT BUY THIS THING . IT WILL SCRATCH UP YOUR DISC INSTEAD OF HELPING TO REMOVE THE SCRATCHES . ONLY USE FOR DISC 'S THAT DON'T WORK FOR SURE ANYMORE PERIOD . IT THING WILL LEAVE YOUR DISC IN WORSE CONDITION THAN IT WAS IN TO THE POINT YOU CAN NOT SELL YOUR DISC AT A PAWN SHOP . THING IS NOT FOR PEOPLE WANT GET DISCS LOOKING GOOD OR PRETTY FOR SELLING OR FOR SHOWCASING .  
1	  I paid approximately 30 for this and am disappointed in the quality . Made of flimsy sheet metal ( and I do mean flimsy ) , the whole thing boasts of asian quality throughout . The top cover doesn't close correctly , latches are poorly aligned , and the paint finish is .. well , un-finished . The white paper you see attached to the pictured unit must have been glued-on by the photographer , because it sure as heck doesn't come that way . Avoid this , unless you just can't find any better .  
2	  I 've been a shortwave radio listener for the past 40 years . Since 1985 I 've been using a Realistic DX-400 for the majority of my listening . I wanted something smaller that was easier to carry around and after considerable research I purchased the Kaito KA1103 . This radio outperforms my DX-400 . It is especially outstanding on the FM and shortwave bands . Regular AM broadcast reception is okay but nothing exceptional . The Kaito KA1103 also receives SSB broadcasts which is a feature not found on many shortwave radios priced under $ 100 . I 've found the SSB reception to also be exceptionally good and stable . In addition to radio amateurs , I 've been able to tune into several commercial aircraft conversations using the SSB feature . Kaito packs this radio with all the accessories you need . You get rechargable batteries , antenna , power adapter , manual , and even a nice carrying pouch for the unit . I also bought the Katio T-1 antenna with my unit but I 've found the supplied antenna to be more than adequate for all my listening requirements . I hesitated before ordering this radio as some reviews knock this product as being " ergonomically hostile " . However , I 've found the radio to be very easy to use though it does take some getting used to . You definitely will need to keep the manual nearby for the first few weeks of use . But once you get used to how this radio operates , you 'll continue to be amazed at its superb performance . Battery life is exceptionally good . I can charge the batteries ( within the radio ) in about 12 hours and that charge will last me 2 to 3 weeks of use assuming I run the radio for about 3 hours per day . Build quality is solid . This is my first Kaito product and I 'm very well pleased with the overall fit and finish of my unit . A great buy !  
2	  After reading the reviews , I figured why not - I 'd only be out $ 2 if they weren't what I was expecting . Well , I got the cable , hooked it up to my gaming system and TV and lo and behold - worked great ! Very happy and even happier that I 've found a place that I can purchase an HDMI cable for this cheap . Highly recommend this to anyone not wanting to spend a lot more $ at their local store .  
1	  Got the sharpener right after Christmas . It did well for a couple of months in the classroom , then wouldn't sharpen anything , although it still turned . This was my second try . I won't invest in one again .  
2	  This is actually a replacement lens-my first 17-85 broke after half a year of ownership ( broken aperture wire ) . Since I could not do without this lens ( I was left with only the 70-300 lens on 4th of July in Vegas ) , I had to either buy a replacement or get it fixed quickly . Overall built quality is OK , the price was economical and I am happy with the picture quality . Recommend for those who are on a limited budget like myself ,  
2	  I purchased this microphone to record a video on YouTube . It was easy to use , and has good video and audio quality . Plus , the price was very reasonable . I can recommend it highly .  
2	  I bought a sub that didn't have an LFE out just a L and R line in . This cable works perfectly . I plugged it into the R line in and immediately heard my booms . I was worried at first when I figured out I had to buy a cable because they are all expensive and not very long . NOT THE CASE HERE . This is an amazing deal . 25 foot long cable for under $ 10 ! Don't waste your money on a monster cable . This cable will do the job just fine .  
2	  It 's been almost 4 years since I bought the Zen Xtra and it 's still the only HD based mp3 player I 've used ( I have a Sansa m230 that I use when I run ) . I 've never had to return it or get it repaired and it still works great . The ONLY flaw I 've had with this player is if I jostle it too hard it will shut itself off and upon powering it on it will display the " Reorganizing the music library " message ( I forget exactly what it says ) and when its finished ( takes about 3 minutes for having 25gb + music ) doing that it will resume where it left off . So that 's my long-term experience with this player . It was also way cheaper than the Ipod at the same capacity when I bought it so I 'm one satisfied customer . ;)  
1	  The most important feature for me was the ability to display photos and play MP3 's for backround music at the same time . This thing won't do it , and the description led me to believe it would ..  
1	  Every review here is accurate . I purchased this player and promptly took it back next day . It put lines through thepicture and I had 3 to 4 white flashes through the screen during a movie . This disc was brand new never before seen so it was not scratched . This player I would definately stay away from . ..  
2	  The product is everything I had hoped it would be and works great without scratching furniture ! The product arrived within a few days as promised , so my only regret is that I did not get a larger one for my laptop . All in all , I am very pleased with the purchase .  
2	  BEWARE - when I bought this , the vendor said they only had the Canon mount not the Minolta / Sony . However , the lens itself has a good combination of reach , wide angle , and wide aperture . There 's a bit of distortion at 24mm so I try to use it not quite zoomed out all the way , but zooming all the way out to 135mm is just fine by me - half the time that 's where I shoot it . Since I 've got the DSLR crop factor to deal with , it 's not as wide as I might want indoors , but I tend to shoot candid-style so I use the 135mm from across the room all the time . I wish I could buy a 24-105mm constant f2.8 lens ; I could maybe give up a few mm of telephoto for f2.8 but I don't want to go all the way down to 75 mm maximum . On the other hand , 24mm is barely enough for me indoors on the wide side so 28mm would not be wide enough . So this lens remains the best compromise for me , short of buying a 17-50mm f2.8 lens and an A700 so I can crop more .  
1	  We bought the Xtreme 320 holder . The zipper broke within weeks ! This means you can't carry or store the thing unless it 's flat . So , basically the money we spent on it is in the toilet . Guess you get what you pay for . We 'll be buying a quality case now .  
1	  There is no excuse for a digital camera in this price range to be outperformed by a comparable camera from 2003 . Every single indoor picture I took with this camera came out grainy and dark . My older 3.1 megapixel camera from four years ago took much , much better pictures until it broke . I 'm going to have it repaired and return this piece of junk .  
1	  I had purchased the Ultra Flat Speaker Wire to add 2 more speakers to make up a 7.1 system .. the wire was just fine however , upon receiving the wire I found that the plastic packaging for the wire was opened with cuts through the plastic and the parts were all over in the shipment box .. it seems that it was opened before .. not happy with this sale !  
2	  I 've only had the opportunity to use this scope a few times so far , and only once for shooting , but have been very satisfied with it thus far . The optics are clear and easy to use , the scope is lightweight , and it appears to be well made . The optical adjustments are also easy to manipulate . The only shortcomings that I noticed is the lack of a taller tripod , which I 've purchased separately , and a narrow field of view at the higher magnification levels . This I expected , though , without going to a much more expensive scope . I can't attest to the waterproof capabilities of the scope , since I wouldn't normally use this in inclement weather and haven't been caught in the rain with it yet .  
2	  I wanted this camera basically because of its small size - I never take a camera out w / me anymore as , being a guy , I have no where to put one other than my jeans pockets ! This camera fits perfectly in your pocket - and takes high quality photos .. the best shot feature is really cool and will help non-experts to take great shots ! The only downside to this camera is that it is not as flexible as I would want it to be manually - I love photography and would like to customize the shutter speed / ISO setting / etc . more . For example , you can only manually drop the ISO to 800 speed - but in the Best Shot Indoor dim light mode the ISO goes past 1000 ( I forget exactly what ) - why can't I set the camera to that manually ? The Best Shot auto mode also does weird things , which somehow take very good photos - for example the camera seems to love ISO 100 - even indoors and in indirect light .. I would think 400 would be a standard setting ? Whatever it does w / the color balance , etc . seems to work though , as the pics still come out nice . I also dont get why I can't take non-blurry pics w / faster shutter and film speeds manually even while using the same settings that the Best Shot mode does .. unless I set the camera to Best Shot Sports mode , which adjusts everything for you . One more thing - this camera is hard to keep stable due to its small size .. tough taking non-blurry pics in dim light sometimes . Do I wish this camera was more flexible ? Yeah , but thats a lot to ask for somethign this tiny and for under $ 300 .. overall a great all-around camera that you will actually take with you !  
2	  Small , compact , cool-looking storage device . No problems or errors . Fast enough . Highly recommended .  
2	  I felt like I got a lot for my money with this thing . The CD player isn't the greatest , but for $ 30 , I didn't expect it to blow the doors off . It 's fine for listening to some music as I fall asleep . The real reason I like this clock / alarm , though , is that it doesn't skimp on the sleep / wake features . There 's a dual alarm , wake to music , wake to alarm , snooze , automatic shut off .. I 've been limping along for the past couple of years with a plain old clock radio that didn't have any nice alarm features , and though these are nothing high tech , this is a good solid little unit for the money .  
1	  I 've had a tough time with my unit , which was delivered just days ago . Set-up was simple enough , but the first time I tried to send a fax , the paper jammed BEHIND and wrapped around a roller . I tried everything to pull it out , called HP tech support , etc . I ended up with lots of small pieces of torn paper , sore fingers , and no progress . The machine is designed in such a way that a simple paper jam can require a technician to take things apart ! HP , I expected better !  
1	  This cam is easy to use and cheap but there are too many other drawbacks . I have a Macbook Pro and the software runs extremely slow . The videos are a pain to edit and the picture and sound quality stinks . I can get way better results using the icam on my laptop . A lousy zoom and double A batteries round out the mess . Even the aluminum foil-like case on the camera is garbage . It was dented and scratched the first day it was used . Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money to get a standard digital camera with the option to take short video clips . Or better yet a digital camcorder so you can more easily edit , burn , and save high quality videos .  
1	  I received it for Christmas and six months later , it 's dead . The problems began intermittantly : I would insert it into the USB slot and it would be recognized as a removable drive , but when I tried to access it , Windows would say that the drive wasn't formatted . Usually , after reseating the drive in the USB port a few times , it would work but now it has quite working completely . Finally , I attempted to reformat the drive and Windows said that the drive couldn't be formatted . Note : I did keep the drive on my keychain so it received a fair amount of wear . Other problems I 've noticed : Fairly slow ( I did not reformat to NTFS as others suggested ) It definately requires a powered USB slotI 've lost the cap countless times . It needs to be secured to the body . The key loop is about to break , due to wear . It needs a heavier construction .  
1	  It was good while it worked . I bought this just after Christmas of 2011 , and it stopped being recognized by my desktop , laptop , and netbook computers on February 1st of 2012 . Unfortunately , the return date was the end of January . How convenient . Don't buy .  
2	  After threading the adapter ring onto my lens , the Z holder slides on easily from the top , the filter slides in easy , holds solid , and the whole thing rotates quite nicely . Although the process is a bit inconvenient , especially while hiking or on the move , it really is quite fast to set up and the results are worth it . No problems using wide angle lenses with the Z holder . Also this system should transition nicely to medium format and large format applications as well , which should make it a great value in the long run .  
2	  I 've had this printer for just under a month now and have to say that it 's just wonderful ! After my HP stopped working ( it was about 10 years old ) , I was in search of a new printer that was affordable , but still high quality . I found it in my i860 ! This printer is almost perfect . It 's fast ( 23 ppm , even though I never printed that much ) , quiet , and the pictures it prints are gorgeous ! Everyone I showed them to couldn't tell the difference from a real picture . The ink tanks are reasonable , and you only throw away the ones that are empty - saving more money in the long run . Using the ' sample ' cartridges that came with the printer , I 've printed at least 15 4x6 " pictures , and 2 8x10 " , as well as at least half a dozen CD labels ( full color , not just writing on white ) , and a few documents .. AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T RUN OUT ! The reason I said almost perfect is because of 2 downsides : # 1 - you have to buy a USB cable separately . Given , you can pick one up for $ 6 or less , but that 's like buying a kid a toy for his birthday and not getting the batteries - it 's useless . I found out that after I bought the USB cable that it does work with a parallel port , which I happened to already have . I used the USB anyway . # 2 - Like many other reviewers said , Canon paper is a must for photos ! Trust me , it doesn't look any different from other paper , but it is . Pictures I printed on HP paper came out grainy . It was almost as bad as printing on my 600 dpi HP . I followed the same picture up with Canon paper , and as I said earlier , no one knew it wasn't a photo . The paper is reasonable , only $ 7.00 for 50 sheets ( This is a sale , so it might go up ) . If it wasn't for those 2 things , this would be a 5-star . I almost rated it 5 anyway . If you buy this printer , you will not be disappointed .  
1	  Followed the instructions ( extremely small print-had to use a magnifying glass to read ) . All indications are that it has a full charge , but won't run the laptop for more than a few minutes .  
2	  I use this device to split the cable signal between my TV tuner , and a Comcast digital-to-analog converter . It has been working as intended for the past few months .  
2	  The phillips shoqbox is awesome .. the great thing about it is .. you have a built in mp3 player / Fm radio / and auxillary in .. the FM radio and the auxillary in are excellent features because the sound quality and battery life of the the shoqbox are " FANTASTIC " .. 12 hours of battery life when i used it play music from my creative zen .. what 's more .. the FM radio reception is also fantastic .. you need the jukebox software to transfer music files but ' that 's just a minor glitch in what is a fantastic product .  
1	  Upon receiving the palmone , I noticed there was no recharger . Since then I have been trying to purchase one in my country , but was told that this is an old model and they don't sell such rechargers . ( I had to pay a more for the delivery than for the palmone , so I didn't want to order one through amazon ) . So , I can't even turn on the palmone ..  
1	  Now , the print out cannot even read , and the total print page nowis only 944 ( But it faded after 200 pages ) - buy another one if you really want a workable printer .  
1	  I bougth this pad because my laptop gets some hot , and i try to keep it cool , but the fans does not provide enough air to the laptop . so is better put the laptop on other type of thing , try some like xbrand . do not buy this .  
2	  I bought this camera to replace my sisters old one which was the older model and she loved it . It has so many features and it takes great pictures . It has a big lcd screen which was one of it 's selling points for her . Canon makes great camera 's and we definitely don't regret buying this one .  
1	  worse than originals by a lot . got them to replace lost earbuds that came with ipod . lower volume , but most importantly , terrible sound , and none of the three sizes stayed in my ear . very tinny , no bass ( I can't understand what people who call them bass-y are talking about ) . Maybe I just got a bum pair , but a total waste of money and time . found an old pair of regular buds lying around the house and the improvement in sound was astounding .  
1	  I 've had nothing but problems with BOTH of the Tungsten E 's that I purchased . The first one lost all of my data about once a month , would turn on by itself , and have to be reset regularly . The cost to have it repaired was over 50 % of the purchase price . I like the software and ease of use of the product and hoped the problem was only a bad battery . So I bought a second Tungsten E. I could never even get it to turn on . I would recommend looking at other manufacturers .  
2	  We use this as a home copier / printerGood points : Instant on - it 's great not to have to waitHigh quality printingReasonably fast print speed2-in-1 button copies two 8x11 pages , reduced , onto one sheetBad points : Can't be connected to wireless network with Windows Vista or 7 - main reason we 're replacing itPaper jams are inconvenient to fix - no matter how simple the jam , you have to nearly take the machine apartLED screen is often hard to see in poor light conditionsNo count of prints in progress - this is surprisingly annoyingNo easy interrupt - there 's a two-or-three - step process involving that dim LED screenNo two-sided printingNo auto-sense for manual paper feed , so half the time I forget and it copies from the main tray  
1	  I bought this product for use with myB + W 77mm Kaesemann Circular Polarizer with Multi-Resistant Coating . I simply bought the largest filter size I needed for my lens kit ( 77mm ) and counted on using step down rings for my other lenses ( 67mm in this case for my Canon 70-200mm f / 4L IS ) . Every other filter in my camera bag is a B + W and every other filter in my bag has been well worth the high price paid . The product is priced not terribly far ( at least by B + W standards ) from cheaper step down rings . It turns out that this is simply because it 's of similar quality to the cheap products ! The step down ring itself is extremely light and is probably made of Aluminum . I find this completely unacceptable based on the fact that B + W touts ( and somewhat justifies the high price of ) their other filters based on the high quality brass ring . My issue with the Aluminum vs . Brass ring isn't based on vanity or snob appeal , but simply the fact that this ring binds nearly 100 % of the time to any other B + W filter ( the only kind I own ) to which it is attached . For a company with a reputation of making ( probably ) the finest camera filter products in the world , this is completely absurd . I 've even gone so far as to attach this ring to my 67mm lenses first , then gently attach my 77mm polarizer to the front of the step down ring . When doing this , I don't even screw the polarizer 's threads to the end of their travel within the step down ring . I choose to gently rotate the front element of the polarizer in the " tightening " direction without touching either the back ring of the polarizer filter or the 67mm-77mm step down ring . By doing this , the polarizer serves as a " clutch " that ensures barely any torque is applied to the polarizer / step down ring interface . NEVERTHELESS , it still sticks ! I 'm an aerospace engineer with a pretty decent technical grasp , so one of the first precautions I took when realizing that this filter was not brass was to be careful not to foul the threads . I can't express how irritating this binding problem is in the field . Based on seeing other reviews for this product , it looks like I 'm not the only one with this sticking problem . Some of the other reviewers gave 5 stars to the product despite the sticking / binding ( are you kidding me ? ) . Another review mentions that small metal shavings are present in the threads of their step down ring after use ( again illustrating why Aluminum is unacceptable for this application ) . B + W , as a professional outfitter , should be absolutely ashamed for having released this product . If this amateur user is annoyed at missed photo opportunities because of this binding issue , I can't imagine how furious a pro would be . I 've never given a 1 star review on Amazon in my life . This is the first and I 'd happily give zero if possible . There is absolutely no excuse for a company like B + W ( with utmost reputation for quality ) to put out this kind of garbage . As of now , my nearly $ 200 B + W polarizer remains bound to this step down ring !  
2	  I 've had this thing for one night and I 'm in love . Instant replay of what I want , no more missing Seinfeld when Jeopardy is on , all the shows I want to see waiting for me when I get home from work . This is the system to have . Set up was so easy and quick ! Get one now !  
2	  We purchase this Viewer to monitor who was in the front yard and aroung our Auto 's . It works good . It sends out a signal from the car port to the house which is about 60 feet .  
2	  This is one great lens . I had used the 18-55 lens before , and wanted a little extra lens . This lens provided everything I wanted . The extra length was a great enhancement , and the IS is totally incredible . This is one versatile lens , and may be the last lens you ever buy , unless you need a true telephoto ! After buying a Canon 30D ( without lens ) I debated on the standard zoom lens , but am more than thrilled that I went with this one . Extra length and the IS give you the best of both worlds . Great lens !  
2	  Pretty nice frames all-around . I wasn't able to find any 4x12 " frames locally at Michael 's . The frames look pretty nice . I ordered 10 and got free shipping . They can sit on a desk or hang from a wall . Solid product .  
2	  I needed a polarizer for my 18-35 mm lens , looked over what was available and bought the Tiffen . Works great easy on and of the lens , full coverage with no vignetting  
1	  I have found that they are almost impossible to remove without damaging the port . The release mechanism doesn't work . I have tried every which way to get them out without damage and it is next to impossible . I damaged my Router trying to get this junk out !  
2	  My only gripe is that 256M is not really enough RAM , 512M is the sweet spot . This is the first new Apple I have ever owned , and the first completely new computer I have had since 1992 .. I 've always upgraded a bit at a time . I had been using a heavily upgraded G3 desktop as my main computer , with my old 1992 PC for the rare occasions I needed Windows ( PC emulation on that old Mac was out of the question ) . Short review : wow . Small , quiet , cool , and powerful . The OpenGL-accelerated user interface makes the fancy graphical transitions and effects smooth and responsive , and the solid design of the OS made the transfer from my old Mac almost seamless .. since all the applications are standalone self-sufficient entities , I could just drag over my Applications and Library directories and " Bob 's your Uncle " - everything just worked . Compare that to a Windows switch , where you have to go back and reinstall everything you HAD been using . In 1984 Apple produced " a computer for the rest of us " . In 2005 Apple 's finally produced " an Apple for the rest of us " . It 's not a " toy " version of the Mac , like the old " LC " boxes seemed to be , it 's a full blown computer in a tiny case , with a moderate price .  
1	  I purchased my HP Media Center system with the HPf2105 monitor in Feb of 2006 . On August 23 , 2006 my power button broke and unlike others it dropped on to my desktop ! Since it was within the 1 year warranty period , HP promplty sent me a replacement . Here I am 7 months later ( just over 30 days outside of my original warranty ) and this power button is broken as well . Over an hour on the phone and still waiting to hear what will be done . I 'd pass on another HP monitor since they obviously can't last more then 6 months of moderate use .  
1	  It is not a Quick-release head tripod ! and it is a bit too short .  
1	  I had hoped to buy this wireless ethernet bridge so that I could place my Canon printer / copier in the garage , without having to use a long ethernet cable . My hopes were dashed , when the product arrived and I set it up . The printer would not be visible on my home network unless I rebooted the ethernet bridge and printer . It would stay visible for a minute or so . After that the ethernet bridge and printer required re-booting ! Overall , it was a bad experience .  
2	  It pleases my heart to see toys like the Fur Real Friends appear on the market . As an avid animal lover , I operate my own kitty rescue shelter in northwest Ohio . I have always recognized the importance of children learning gentleness and kindness with animals . I believe that toys like Fur Real Friends can help teach children the precious human virtue of kindness toward all living things . At this time I can only fairly rate this toy on its educational merit , because I do not own one , yet . However , I do hope they will be available for purchase soon !  
2	  As all of you " L " users know , the optics on these lenses are just amazing . For those of you looking to buy one of these lenses , this is definitly a good start . This lens is constructed from tank material I 'm sure . It not only has superb optics , it also is very fast in low light . The IS is one of the best features , giving you the ability to hand hold the lens in almost any low light situations ! Another beautifully crafted lens from Canon . Highly recommend ! View some of my work at ( .. )  
2	  Not a single one were defective . All burned at 8X with a NEC 3500 drive . And judging by what others say on the Internet about this media , I think this the one to buy .  
1	  Worked for about two weeks then nothing . Checked both ends for good connection but still no power through it . Put my old one back on that I use on my motorcycle and device works fine . So I put the new back in and wiggled the plug end of the wire and was able to get power if I held the wire to one side . Junk !  
1	  This print server shows great promise but delivers nothing but frustration . After following the provided instructions for Mac OS X , System Preferences was apparently able to recognize and set up the printer , but I still couldn't print to it . When I clicked " Print " , I just got a message saying the computer was trying to connect - for many minutes - with no response from the printer . So I went back to the printer 's web configuration page , which seems very nice in theory , but is completely unhelpful . The manual says the print server only works in " Ad Hoc " mode , but the configuration page has options to connect in " Infrastructure " mode . I have a vague sense of what the difference is between these two modes , and I know how to switch between these kinds of networks , but my vague sense and basic networking skills did me no good because it doesn't matter WHAT mode the printer is in - it never prints . Wait - that is not exactly true . It prints one thing : the test page . Yep . When you 're in the configuration web pages , you can click " Print Test Page , " and it actually will . Fantastic ! But that 's where the success stops . It prints NOTHING other than the test page . Unfortunately , D-Link tech support politely informed me that if the test page prints , the print server works fine and I just don't know how to set up the printer . I should contact Apple to find out how to set up a printer , they said . Excuse me ? If ONLY the test page prints , the print server does not work fine . I attempted to sway them with my logic , but I was unsuccessful . " Thank you for calling D-Link , " they said . I hung up . The most irritating part of the whole ordeal was the e-mail I received from DLink the next day . It was a summary of my call : " - Logged into the DP-311P " - Printed test page ( successful ) " Matthew has successfully printed a test page . Resolved . " I responded : " I want to make sure you know that my technical support phone call was incredibly unhelpful . I had managed to get the test page printing from the configuration web site on my own , but the print server was totally unresponsive when I created an IP printer in Mac OS X. I waited thirty minutes to speak to David , who then informed me that he couldn't do anything for me because D-Link can't help past getting the test page to print in configuration mode . " Well then what 's the point of technical support ? Simply getting the test page to print is NOT what most users want to do with their print server . I have years of experience working on Macs and I know how to set up a printer ; that is not the issue . The issue is getting the D-Link to communicate with the printer under normal circumstances . Unless I can get this fixed , I will be forced to return the print server . " I received no response to my e-mail . After 2 + weeks of tinkering around with various computers , various networks , various settings , and various routers ( including a D-Link router ) , I have Officially given up . I am returning this print server to the store , and I shall do everything possible to avoid buying DLink again . I recommend all reasonable users do the same .  
1	  This system has no digital inputs , so if you want to use it with an Xbox or a PlayStation 2 for Dolby / DTS playback , you 're out of luck . Consider yourself warned .  
2	  This is exactly what my daughter asked for Christmas - the value of this refurbished item was unbeatable and has the same warranty as a brand new one !  
2	  first off . i love these headphones . and i also love amazon especially since i am an amazon prime and amazon visa user . but for a product like this , i would recommend buying it at a bestbuy and buying the extended warranty there . so you can just walk in and get replacements . i run quite often and these headphones can only take so much . best running headphones IMO . the nike ( made by philips ) version of these types of headphones is quite similiar . but from personal experience ( and other people 's experiences ) , i 've had the actual headphones ( attached to my iphone ) shock me while i 'm running . so i would recommend these over the nike ones . 4 stars only because they are so fragile  
1	  Lots of problems here : 1 . The support pads on the bottom of the mouse are too big and too soft . This causes the mouse to stick to the desk surface as you use it . The mouse pointer jumps due to the stiction . The pads need to be smaller and harder material . 2 . The mouse wheel is sloppy . The mouse button doesn't work well . The click happens at too deep a level and is not consistent . No detent on mouse wheel . 3 . The MS Mouse software caused my synaptics touch pad to stop working . I had to uninstall it to get my touch pad back . All I can say is - Microsoft , What were you thinking ? This product really makes me rethink getting other Microsoft hardware in the future .  
1	  If you have a Canon A630 as I do , it not a desirable case . It like a woman who like to wear tight blue jeans . You can just barely button it up . Forget about carrying extra batteries or extra SD memory cards .  
2	  what can I say , it works like a charm . No Problems , with the product but it did take a little longer to get the item in the mail .. I think it was a UPS thing and not the company .  
1	  Unless they have fixed it this is junk do not buy it . After sending the first one back for a refund we received a second one with no refund . It worked .. for about ten mins . the batery clip fell out . I gave it 1 star because there are no negative numbers . This is a complete piece of junk  
2	  ( Updated Aug . 07 ) The seller has corrected the photo so it shows only the cartridge - when I wrote this review , they showed a whole set . But to keep them honest , and for the record , here is my original review : THIS PRODUCT PHOTO FALSELY IMPLIES THAT YOU WILL GET A FULL SET OF HP 02 INK CARTRIDGES . THE DESCRIPTION IS FOR ONE ONLY . THE PHOTO IS MISLEADING IF NOT DOWNRIGHT DECEPTIVE . DO NOT BE FOOLED ! Now that 's out of the way , I highly recommend the HP 02 color ( and black ) series inkjet cartridges . Unlike competitors designs , the print-head is built-in , so you get a new one every time you change the cartridge . Also , although the cartridges hold less than half the 13ml of ink you get with the new Canon " 8 " series , the ink used to clean is actually recycled back into the cartridge , so there is less waste .  
2	  I really love this Machine , looks great ! But not sure whether it support Chinese display . In the manu it just says with multi-languagu support . Anyone can help ?  
2	  Great product . I ordered two , but only got one and charged for one . Seems to me , I should be sent another one .  
1	  I just got this thing an hour ago and leaving aside the " english " in the manual I just want to know how long do I have to charge it , the charger 's got 2 lights , I plug it in and it shows one red and one green but after 1 minute the green one disapears and it just shows the red one .. do I have to leave it charge for hours ?  
2	  Working perfectly in my Dell Latitude D520 running Vista Home Basic . Huge performance increase from 512 MB of RAM . No more thrashing the hard disk swap area . The system is much more responsive .  
1	  Why would Amazon even sell garbage like this . Anyone who bought this should contact Amazon for a refund . Stop payment on your credit card if you didn't get your written contract in the mail .  
1	  When the speakers came , they were wonderful . For a little price I got a good quality sound . But after a week it is annoying . I 'm very dissapointed .. I didn't expect a miracle , but now the speakers cannot be used at all . Another thing : they didn't arrive with a USB cord as other people said ( not a seller 's problem since after buying them , I realized the USB was not included ) .  
1	  I bought mine 2 months ago , and for no reason at all , while i was taking some vids through my camera , it stopped functioning . I was unable to read the device and now its waiting to end up in the bin . The travelite works fine so far .  
1	  After just under 3 months of use , it is not working . Although I liked the fact that I could plug in an extra device , I was afraid of using it . Yesterday I used it for the first time to charge my iPod at the same time I was listening to it . This morning when I went to use it again , it just did not work at all . I guess my gut feeling was right . To be fair , the quality of the sound was very good , and up until this morning I was very happy with it . If you still want to buy this product , just make sure you don't plug any additional device to it .  
2	  Small , light , easy to use right out of the package . Excellent quality video and very good sound . It doesn't tell you that you need Microsoft XP in order to upload it to your computer . I don't have XP , and that was a big disappointment . I have to use someone else 's computer to edit . My next computer will be an Apple ! Have captured wonderful video , and can make a DVD at CVS . Simple buttons , and over all , a very good product . Would definitely reccommend !  
1	  My order was incomplete . I received no remote control with the order . Audiovox would not sent me the missing remote control because it was 40 days and not 30 days since I purchased the portable DVD player . They will make no adjustments after 30 days even if they do not sent the whole product . They would sell me a remote control for $ 21.75 . I consider this the worst in customer service . Also if you call them you will wait on hold for 30 minutes .  
1	  HDMI cables should not cost as much as monster cables - the gold tipped ends do nothing for digital signals . No need to go for high end , just get inexpensive ones . However , I see why this particular batch was lowered all the way down to less than $ 2 . It worked for a couple of weeks , but now it either flickers or has digital artifacts on the screen . At less than $ 2 , though , it 's not even worth trying to return .  
2	  Hi-These headphones have great response to sounds - AKA they sound clear . However , this is not the case with the bass . If you are a DJ , or a bass lover , they are lacking in that department . They can get solid bass really only when turned up very loud or when there are no mids / highs currently playing . But , all in all they have great sound . As far as durability , they currently feel solid .  
1	  Trust me it does not work . I have tried it on all rooms , anddoes not transmit . Waste of money . If you want an item that does work I have found the SBC wireless to be the best and you can buy it at amazon or walmart .  
2	  Item was shipped on a timely matter and when I got it was as advertised new in package well pleased over all .  
1	  As another reviewer mentioned , this unit is not recognized by my computer if I plug it in through a USB extension cord . It is very strange because the unit works fine if plugged directly into the computer . Other 2.0 deviced work fine through the same extension cord this was attempted with . Summary : Short cord , extension cables may not work .. purchase a different brand .  
2	  I got a great deal on this subwoofer . i used this to replace a 10 year old jensen sub in my dodge durango . I was blown away by the difference . The jensen sounded good , untill I put this Rockford in . I just have one , in a sealed box , in the back of a durango , and it still hits hard as a rock . The bass is tight , clear , and zero distortion . For reference , im powering it with a small kenwood amp ( kac5204 ) it rates at the same watts as this sub , and its the perfect combo . If u want a reliable tight sounding sub , this is the one . UPDATE : WOW , i got this sub for 32 dollars , now its 99 ? go to crutchfield its only 79 there .  
1	  I loved the soft glow , three levels of lighting and touch off / on feature of this lamp . But I bought two of them and they both flickered to the highest level of light without me touching them . I was trying to sleep with the low light on and finally had to turn the lamp off . Felt like my bedroom was haunted ! Anybody else have this problem ?  
1	  Found this case to be poorly constructed - I travel w / laptops / training materials frequently and have owned / used several cases over the years ; liked idea of side access ( so one can pull laptop from overhead storage bin with minimal difficulty ) - however , telescoping handle detent pin ( s ) broke on 2nd trip ; causing handle to be stuck in extended position ; had to literally rip bag / handle apart in airport in order to get it collapsed so I could get it back on board . Previous ( several years ago ) versions of this bag are well rated ; but recent reviews would seem to indicate a deterioration in quality . Can't recommend and will not purchase a SOLO product again .  
1	  I bought this transducer for my new Ocean Kayak . I was disappointed to see it comes with 30 feet of cable . Humminbird and Ocean Kayak are owned by the same parent corporation . Ocean Kayak modified the scupper holes of many models specifically for this Humminbird transducer . How hard would it be for Humminbird to measure the distance for the longest possible install distance and provide the right amount of cable ? I thought I was buying a well thought out solution . I got 20 plus feet of clutter .  
1	  Attracted by the low price ( $ 20 ) I bought this set mainly for the wide angle converter . Unfortunately , it provides no benefit with my recently purchased Panasonic VDR-D210 camcorder . The wide-angle converter itself intrudes into the picture beginning in the corners when the camcorder is set at the widest setting . By the time I get rid of the darkened corners , I have zoomed in to 2x which leaves me back where I started . With a 32x zoom , the 2x tele converter is not really necessary but does it help ? I found that the sharpness is degraded to the point that the camcorder occasionally has trouble focusing . I tried both automatic and manual focus in one test of zooming in on fine print . The loss of clarity made fine print hard to read . It was more readable without the tele-converter and using the digital zoom instead to get to the same 64x zoom level . Maybe these would provide $ 20 of value with some other camcorder but I wish I hadn't spent the money . I don't know what price point below $ 200 would give satisfactory results . I would want to try anything else before I spent any more money on this type of product .  
1	  HP ScanJet 5590 Digital FlatBed ScannerQuality-wise , this scanner is fine for my needs ; I am scanning old photos for archiving and the software that comes with it is easy-to-use and I was impressed with how easy it was to fix up photos , albeit I was looking for something quick . That being said , I would not recommend this scanner for the following reasons : 1 ) It locks up in the middle of scanning , so you have to periodically save your images . This seems random and on two occasions I 've had to re-scan a number of photos . The scanner just gets stuck and stops responding until I do a cold re-start , which means pulling the plug . 2 ) The ADF is useless . I couldn't get it to take anything in without jamming , if it even took the paper in . It 's the reason I got the scanner and a big reason why I am returning it .. 3 ) The price is ridiculous for this thing ; it 's bulky and the ADF is useless . I don't really see how it 's any better than a cheaper scanner , as the the price is inflated by the useless ADF scanner . Don't waste your money with this piece of garbage ; I 'm taking it back .  
2	  With Mac OS 10.6 , Apple stopped supporting their own Appletalk protocol for printers . As a result , older perfectly good printers could not be used . This device enables older HP printers that also have a parallel port to be used on an ethernet network , which OS 10.6 can see . It works seamlessly once installed .  
1	  I know from some of the other reviews that this mouse COULD be kinda ' exciting ' compared to an ancient ' ball mouse ' .. ( Does anyone even have one of those anymore ? ) But when it comes to our modern ' sensor-mice ' of today ? This thing is actually pretty so-so . ( though for a quick $ 19 buck fix .. propably ok . ) Like some others have stated , I 've noticed that the wheel and buttons are none-too precise . TOO ' sensitive ' when you wouldn't like them to be .. and alternatively not quite so responsive at other times . The buttons and wheel do routinely ' click / move ' themselves which can be a minor annoyance . On top of that .. the whole thing has a bit of a ' cheap flimsy ' feel to it .. and the wheel likewise has a very cheap clunky feel to it ( I kid not - It 's like a wheel on a cereal-box toy ) and broke down on mine after a few months . And as someone else mentioned ? The BIG RED light on the back ( the things ' snazziest feature ' ) is actually pretty annoying come movie time or likewise . ( I have to turn it around as well ) After having tried out this one Microsoft mouse ? .. I 'm actually perplexed why so many people think they 're so great . Seriously , the mouse that came with my old HP ( which I wouldn't have even thought much of at the time ) - spun wheels around this piece of junk .. and lasted a HELL OF A LOT longer ! Sorry , put the only impression I got from trying this one Microsoft mouse - was never to bother buying another one from them again . 2 stars for an barely-average sensor mouse at a minimal $ 20 bucks . That 's it .  
1	  These batteries don't fit Canon Powershot S100 as stated on Amazon page . I just received two , will have to return .  
1	  The Speakers worked for about 2 weeks , I thought it was something I did to cause them to go out on me . Because I still had the box for these speakers , I boxed it up and it has been sitting in my garage for 5 years . I just recently pulled it out to see if I could fix the problem . Everything works as far as speakers and subwoofers . What failed was the Circuit board on the Subwoofer . Now I am looking at trying to purchase the Circuit board . But after reading these reviews I will probably just buy a different subwoofer that has quality reviews and recycle the speakers into a whole new system .  
2	  I have a 15 " 1ghz powerbook and I used to connect . Basically I did not even read the directions . I plugged it in and somehow I played with the airport settings .. I think all I did was plug it in .. and it turned on and started the network ! I love it . I get an 80 % signal though .. but then again that maybe due to my powerbook as they are not good with their signal since the antenna is internal .  
1	  I needed a replacement for a stock 5.25 inch mid-bass speaker for the front kick panel enclosure , nothing fancy . I am using my stock head unit , pushing no more than 30watts . This Pyramid speaker was absolutely horrible ! The specs for the frequency response ( down to 60Hz ) and sensitivity ( 92db ) were a joke . The volume from this speaker was non-existant until I cranked it up to about 1/2 way , at which time I could barely hear muddy bass and hollow mid-range . Crank it up to about 3/4 just to get it moderately loud , and everything was completely distorted .. The other stock speakers sounded loud and undistorted , but this Pyramid was so distorted and distracting that it made my 16yr old stock speakers sound like champs ! Just out of curiosity , I then hooked this speaker up to an old bookshelf system I have lying around and I ran some frequency tests on it using a DVD audio input . Sure enough , anything below 120Hz sounded like I was murdering it . The 1KHz-5KHz range seemed relatively clean , just needed to be louder . Bottom line - cheap speaker made in China with fudged specifications . It has good apparent external quality , and nice heft to the magnet , but that 's about it . May be a adequate replacement for a dedicated mid-range as long as you use cross-overs to keep out the frequencies it has no business even attempting ..  
2	  I have a down firing sub woofer on thick carpet that underperforms . My solution was to affix these big spikes to the underside of a heavy patio block on which sits the sub . The spikes transfer the unmuffled sound right to the subfloor . No more mushy bass . Good quality components in this spike kit .  
2	  I love this product ! It has a very clear picture . It is very easy to down load and run !  
2	  Been using mine for over a year every day print lots of checks and letterhead documents for several companies and the only time I had a problem with paper was when our A / C was out and it was really humid . Other than that this is an awesome printer for a small office . I use it all of the time for really large reports ( 200-250 pages ) and it works like a champ on those as well . I would highly recommend this printer over a Brother any day !  
1	  Bought this keyboard because my wife needed a numerical pad and I wanted wireless . Keyboard for no reason , frequently becomes undiscoverable . Their website is useless . Currently have fresh batteries , cannot sync it - AGAIN . If had to do over , would never have bought this keyboard .  
2	  So far , I have not had any power surge to test its effectiveness , but it is nicely built mechanically . No complains  
2	  For the price - you can't beat it - when you don't want to turn on a hot oven during the hot summer days , this will save that and cook your delicious meals in a fraction of the time - very well built with no problems whatsoever  
1	  In general , I really like Sony products , and I started out really liking these a few years ago . I have three pairs now , and the two newest pairs have started the wire-shredding thing you 've probably read about . The oldest and most-used pair has a more " plasticy " feel to the wires , whereas the newer ones are rubbery and stretchy , and will continue to deteriorate over time . This is a well-known issue with these lately , so if you can get ones with the plasticy wires , you should be in great shape . BUT , once you 've tried high-end in-ear-monitors ( IEMs ) like Ultimate Ears or Shure , you 'll do what I did and give these away or sell ' em outright . Would have been 4 stars without the recent quality issue . Pros : Decent sound . Although you can do better in this price range with Sennheiser , Panasonic , or Creative , these are by no means " horrible " . A definite HUGE step up from whatever lousy free ' buds you may have gotten with your player . STRONG bass , lots of treble . Cute carrying case , nice to have different size tips to use to get the fit right . They don't protrude from your ears , so you can probably sleep in them if you want to . If you buy them , buy ' em here . Cons : Durabilty , durability , and durability . I 'm personally going to avoid these for a while until Sony gets the wire issue sorted out . Bass , while strong , is not detailed or controlled . Treble , while definitely there , is subject to painful sibilance at higher levels . Cute little case will fall apart quickly . Bottom line : Formerly a good product for the price , but you should try to find something else if you haven't already been stuck with these .  
2	  I had these headphones sent to my mother , who loves all things pink after having seen Legally Blonde , but hates the in-ear buds that came with her pink ipod shuffle . I wanted to get her something that is easy to wear while walking , and remembered having seen a set of these in black , so I found pink here , on Amazon . She was a little skeptical , because she thought that they would be like the buds , only with ear clips , but she loves the sound and the way that these buds fit into her ear seems much more natural to her . These are perfect for someone who is looking for some headphones that are comfortable , inexpensive , and have some decent sound .  
1	  In the picture it has a carrying handle / strap . This is rubbish - the one I got had neither . I ordered it for one reason - to make it easier to carry . In the bag it is harder to carry . Out on the bag the screen has a handle , using the bag it has not .  
2	  I too just got it from Target . I 've had it about 3 weeks and everything is great . Good picture , good sound . Couldn't be happier .  
2	  Not much to say - it 's a couple of batteries , and they both work like new . Shipping was fast , and all aspects of the transaction went smoothly .  
2	  This plug strip was a great addition to our travel electronics on a recent European trip . The cord is short and the unit compact so that it took up little room . Combined with the appropriate plug adaptor we we able to charge three item from one wall outlet . With the number of electronic devises we all carry ; phone , iPod , camera , computer , etc , finding a simple charging solution is a challenge . This product is a great solution . Note as stated the cord is short so the unit is compact , this was not a problem .  
2	  I had trouble finding a stylish CD Wallet . I found that CD Wallets in styles that WOMEN like are very scarse ! Fortunately , I found this one . It is very sturdy . The exterior has a very short faux fur which is very soft to touch . The incide is clear and white . I also love the handle . It can almost be worn like a wrist wallet . I just love that I found this item ! I hope companies start making more CD Wallets that women like .  
2	  I was very pleased with my Belkin purchase . I was focused on a few things , 1 . length to go behind my sofa . 2 . plenty of transformer plug ins and it met both .. I am VERY PLEASED !  
2	  This keyboard combo actually works better than most other wireless keyboard / mouse combos I have tried at any price . At the low price I paid , an amazing value . Highly recommended .  
1	  I received a cheap off brand instead ofthr Jensen it 's advertised under . The sound quality was bad and I had to go and buy another one anyway , because it did not utilize both of my car speakers . Waste of $ 8  
2	  This card holds more images than I need and the brand has always proven to be a good purchase .  
2	  Does what it is supposed to do . Only criticism is the volume control knob is a little small .  
1	  A expected better from a brand like Philips . The DVD player plays all DVDs and CDs but there is an annoying ticking sound as you play most DVDs .  
1	  I really enjoyed the Premium Glossy Photo Paper which came with my Epson Stylus CX3810 . Believing that this was the same stuff , I picked it up . To my dismay I learned that every shingle sheet is not 4x6 , but actually larger . This paper is intended to be used with software called LivePix which doesn't even come with every Epson printer ( and apparently not with mine ) . It does have a 4x6 section with perforated edges , but that doesn't help me at all unless I have the software . As a result , I had to tear all the perforation off of every sheet before I could use it with the printing wizard already in Windows XP . This is junk . You are better off buying some other kind which is already 4x6 .  
1	  This was a great mouse for the 4 months that it work correctly . The scroll wheel just went out . So much for the " Revolutionary hyper-fast scroll wheel " We will see how the warranty goes ..  
2	  Very good headphone , for a good price . Had this a for a few weeks now , and I use it every night . The Highs are clear and base is crisp . Very comfortable to wear . The reception needs to be adjusted once in a while , but three million electronic devices in my room may have something to to with that . Only one con : No battery charger in base . I just use a couple of rechargeble batteries . AA . Great h  
2	  This case is great , it survived being run over by bus , although the ipod inside did not , however the case is in excellent shape .  
1	  Initially I liked this product . I 've owned it 1 1/2 years and it died on me . I 'm very disappointed .  
1	  I am not a professional photographer , or anything that resembles one , I am a mom that wants to take photos of everyday memories .. this is a horrible camera for that . Or anything for that matter .. THE FLASH IS WAAYY TOO BRIGHT . There is no way to change it , and I have absolutely never taken a good photo with this camera . It 's awful & I do not recommend this camera for anyone , not even teenagers or children .  
1	  I thought this would eliminate the 5 remotes littering my family room , but only managed to replace one , leaving me with still 5 remotes . The harmony doesn't work with the Sony PS3 because it lacks blue tooth . You can buy a USB IR receiver to stick out of the front of the PS3 , but you 'd still have to get up and power it on . The harmony doesn't work at all with the Nintendo Wii . It claims to work with the original xbox if you have the IR dongle plugged in , but again , you have to get up and turn the unit on . However , it wouldn't work on my xbox running XBMC ( it may have if I had the time and patience to play with it ) . It would sort of work with my dish network HD DVR . It could power it on and change the channel / volume stuff , but had no buttons to control any DVR functions . The only device the harmony played well with was my Pioneer receiver and Sharp Aquos LCD . I could have used my receiver 's remote to control these things . The remotes LCD display turns on whenever you move the remote , which is somewhat annoying at times . The display also is of low quality and doesn't look like it has the ability to make you own icons , only the generic ones , therefore if you have two game systems , they 'd both be called " Play Game " , which isn't very helpful . Very disappointed in this product considering all it 's hype .  
2	  A lot of people seem to spend a lot on their digital music players and then pair them with cheap headphones / earbuds . But , like home stereos , you 're better off spending more on your speakers than on the electronics . I 've paired these with an MP3 player that is less than $ 20 and the result sounds fantastic . These are simply a great set of earbuds . I 'm finally hearing a decent amount of bass from my music and , in a lot of cases , details that I 've never heard from a portable music system . Buy these . You won't regret it . By the way , these are much better than the Super . fi 3 's . After getting the 5 's , I thought I 'd get the 3 's for my wife to use at the gym . The 3 's have noticably less bass capabilities . Stick with the 5 's , if you can .  
1	  I bought this mouse for my bluetooth-equipped MacBook . The first one often refused to turn back on after it would either go into sleep mode , ( I 'm assuming that 's what it did ) or after I physically turned it off . I returned it and brought home a 2nd one . It does the same thing . I tried different batteries , pairing it with the laptop numerous times and I have finally given up . My overall rating ? Don't buy it .  
2	  good quality , nice design , sets up and works flawlessly ( did not have same problem with sleep as prior poster , it does sleep but comes out of sleep mode transparently as soon as you move it ) . i have used this product under FreeBSD 5 , FreeBSD 6 , and occasionally WinXP , on a ThinkPad T43 and now a ThinkPad T60p . i like the bluetooth over the normal USB dongle wireless for two reasons : 1 ) no dongle to lose or break off2 ) no interference from other devices if you have more than one wireless mouse or keyboard in the same area . great product . don't know why i don't see it more often in retail stores , you have to go online to get it .  
1	  I sent a message to the supplier and Amazon asking for information about returning the product . Although the product was listed as in stock in California , and I live in California , it took one week for delivery . I received no reply on my request for a return .  
2	  I Have always been in into the best sound I can get at good prices . and Sony products always comes thru . This system does the job 10 times over . easy to install great sound and you can add on if you like . I recommend it highly and the price you can't beat . I got it new It came the next day Talk about service ! Sony LBT-ZX6 Mini Hi-Fi Component System  
1	  I was unsatisfied with this purchase the co . selling didnot diclose that it din't have an insalation CD that made impossible to install . Never again  
1	  Seeing so many generally positive reviews , I guess I was just unlucky . But , FYI this worked for about 10 seconds for me then quit and never worked again . A piece of junk .  
2	  This is a nice audio cable . It gives the feeling of a quality product . I can't objectively judge or claim it 's quality since i don't have proper tools , but the cable is thick ( still it is flexible ) , looks solid and the connectors are very nicely done ( and gold plated ) . I can't notice any noise that would be attributed to bad cables . The sound is crisp and clear ( this cable runs from CD to receiver ) so i am very pleased with the cable . Isolation has sort of satin-like finish and looks better than " average " cable . Usually one hides these cables so not that important , but it does add to the overall quality feeling . I would buy this cable again .  
1	  I won't ever be purchasing another HP Printer . This printer is SLOW at scanning . SLOW at copying . It takes about 1 minute to make 1 copy . - And im not kidding . The paper tray is a joke . The Software disk provided wouldn't even load on 2 different networked machines . The Downloaded drivers CRASHED both systems . When you strip out all the bloatware to just use the driver - it causes constant instability with the network and the PC 's when booting , constantly giving DLL errors with the driver pack . I sent it back . And Remember .. you only have 30 days to return it , after that , HP has to service it IF .. they deem it has an issue .  
2	  This drive is like the brand name implies , super simple to install . On my XP machine , I just connected the cables to the drive , a power outlet , and my computer and presto I was in business . Nothing more to install , connect or configure . It comes pre-formatted in FAT32 , which is perfect for my needs , as I want to be able to connect it to both XP and Windows 98 machines . The drive is super quiet . Unlike previous models , there is no cooing fan , but the aluminum case can get really warm , particularly on hot summer days . My home has no air conditioning and on hot days , the drive seems warmer than usual , but it could be me too . The drive is very responsive and fast . Transfers of my audio projects in the hundreds of megabytes take seconds . I applaud the makers and designers of this drive for the simplicity , ease of use , and peace of mind it has brought me .  
2	  I have owned this Sima CT-2 for a year now ; It works just fine . Maybe Mr. Galt recieved a defective one , or some other issue . I recommend this item , especially if you can keep the power transformer handy , to unplug it when not in use , ( the only fault i have found ) .  
1	  I bought one of these about two years ago and it was easy enough to install . Had it up and running within minutes . But then , if you can't figure out how this thing works , you really shouldn't be using coax or toslink interconnects . Or anything involving electricity . It seems that about every two or three weeks , I have to fool around with the wiring behind my cabinet . Usually the dog hides something back there and later starts ' digging ' to get it back out . Anyway , that means I end up moving around the wires and converter quite a bit . Within 6 months , the sound started cutting out on the unit . I quickly realized that it was due to the seriously cheap power connection leading into it . I figured out that if I got it into just the right position and duct-taped it that way , it would be fine .. for a while . As much as I loved spending time tweaking a wire and then trying to keep it in position while feeling like Larry the Cable Guy , it just wasn't that fun after the 20th time . I kept screwing around with that stupid method for a year and a half , until today . I figured it was a new year ( I 'm writing this on Jan . 1 ) and I wasn't going to put up with it at all anymore . I looked around online and found out that Radio Shack has a similar device for a few bucks more . Since there is a RS store just a few blocks from my place , I picked one up right away and had it installed within a half hour of my decision to replace the crappy original . Now I 'm not affiliated with Radio Shack in any way , and generally don't shop there because I feel their prices are consistently too high . But their quality is usually pretty good . And MUCH better in this case . The new unit appears to be very durable , occupies less space and actually sounds significantly better . Plus , I got a 3 year ' no questions asked replacement warranty ' for only an extra buck . That 's even cheaper than a roll of duct tape . So , to wrap up my review .. this item is cheaply made and not at all durable . On the other hand , it sounds kinda crappy . But hey , when you factor in the shipping , it 's about the same price as what you can probably get locally .. and you have to wait 3-5 days to get it . Plus , when it goes bad ( and it will eventually ) you get to buy a new one . What a great deal . Just be sure to pick up duct tape , too .  
1	  I wish I had read the reviews first . They are dead on ! The wire is very thin , maybe 18-20 gauge . Also the protective jacket is purple . I had to put my project on hold and re-order larger wire for car stereo install .  
1	  After reading a lot of reviews about this mouse , I was hoping this mouse would do me well , but YEAH RIGHT ! The folks that said the distance range sucked were frank . I only used this mouse once and I 'm about to return it . The mouse had to be at most 1 feet away from the USB receiver otherwise there was a short delay and the further away it was , the worst it got . Eventually you won't see the cursor on the screen . How lame is that ? Its only good if you plan on using it very close to the laptop / desktop . In short , this mouse was utterly USELESS to me ! End of story .  
2	  I 've used quite a few different brands of Ethernet cables , including making my own . Triplite 's are by far the best , both for quality , cost and the top of the cable is very well designed ( where a boot usually goes ) .  
1	  This product sounds aweful on the receiving end . In the car it sounds great through the car speakers but to the caller , it sounds like your in a steel garbage can . I returned the original one ordered because I thought there was a problem with it . The second one I received is just as bad . I stopped using it soon after I received it . I don't know if I can send it back for a full refund . Not worth the money , sorry Satechi .  
1	  This keyboard is the cheapest feeling keyboard I 've ever used . Only after a few days of typing the keys started to stick and requires a little more effort to press some keys . In general it feels more stiff when typing rather than a nice cushy feel . This never happened from the other 5 keyboards I 've used . If you really want to get a Microsoft keyboard then try getting the Elite which I also own . As for the ergonomic layout , I 've noticed that it 's not completely neccesary . If I use a standard keyboard that doesn't try to save money by compacting the keys together then I don't get wrist problems . You have to find a keyboard that provides a good amount of space between each keys . Although you still need to use a wrist pad and the flatter the keyboard the better . But no matter what you do don't waste your money on this keyboard .  
1	  This combo drive is pretty lousy in important places . First off , the DVD drive . It will freeze during movies and click and bounce around inside the player . Sometimes it will stop clicking and start back up after a minute or more , but other times it will have to be totally shut off . And secondly , the VHS player . It plays VHS movies fine except for some annoying problems . About a month after purchase the player started squeeling when fast-forwarding or rewinding . Now this might be only annoying , but it makes me question the quality of the machine considering it started one month after purchase . Overall , the only positive feature is the abilty to watch local channels and VHS tapes . That is pretty sad , because this thing should do a whole lot more .  
1	  As others have mentioned , this keyboard is excellent in all ways but one - the spacebar . The keys themsleves have a great tactile feel and are very quiet - exaclty what I was looking for . However , the spacebar is massive ( and not split in two as it should have been ) , with the actuator right in the middle . Unfortunately , when your hands are in the natural position your thumbs are at the far left and right of the spacebar . Not only do you have to push pretty hard to get it to go down , it also makes a REALLY LOUD clicking noise because you 're actually forcing the actuator down at an angle . If they redesign this with a split spacebar I would LOVE it !  
1	  I have a Dell Insperon Notebook and can not detect the PCMCIA card much less the compact flash in it . This could be an error on my end but after several hours of trouble shooting I can not help but think that this card just doesn't work . I would not recommend this product .  
2	  Nikon has about the best reputation in photography and if they put their name on it , it 's good enough for me . It has proven to be a good product for me and I 'd recommend it .  
1	  Please do not waste money and time on that piece of $ % @ # ! Never got to listen to a song , died instantly . Do NOT go there ..  
1	  This drive has been discontinued ( thankfully ) - and I 'm now patiently waiting for the price to become somewhat competitive on the new ones . Apparently , Lacie continues to believe that they have a lock on the Apple market and can continue charging Apple prices for their inferior products . At any rate , I received two of these drives , both of which were sent back . If you want to trust 500GB worth of data to a drive that constantly makes screeching , grinding metal-on-metal scratching noises , then this is the drive for you . The Seagate drive they stuck inside the case on these drives also has notoriously bad reviews . Stay away .  
1	  This concerns not exactly this Printer-Modell but the HL 1030 and HL 1240 : I own both and have same problems with toner spread over the paper . This turns the hole Paper from white to gray . For concept-quality you can use it but not for office recommendations . Don't buy it ! Take HP !  
2	  Great , awesome player . Great shock protection , does not skip a beat . Cheapest player out there supporting Packet-Written CD-RW , very cool feature !  
2	  This card has worked fine in my notebook running Win98 .. As the reviewer below says , the ' clip ' that holds the RJ45 & coax socket onto the PCMCIA card is a bit flimsy , but mine still works after nearly a year of use .  
2	  looks pretty good , feels solid and makes for a great lens protector . Screws on easily and allows other lens attachments / lens cap to be affixed .  
1	  I purchased this item a month ago and if you only need to listen to audio for 3 hours at a time , it 's OK . I guess my sour attitude is related to the disappointment ; the unit is really well built .. both light and sturdy . The concept is interesting , but is executed poorly . If you take the time to fully charge the internal battery , you might get an hour out of it . Then take a newly charged battery and place it in the battery pack and you might get another two ( this is far shy of the 6.5 and 10 hours promised ) . And if you want the unit to listen to audio books , it will prove frustrating . If you pause for more than a few seconds , it will turn off ; leaving you to start the chapter or the book over . Whatever .. I 'm moving on to something else . You might think twice before wasting your time on this one .  
2	  I bought this at outpost . com a couple of months ago . It is very convenient and works as expected . If your USB ports are very close to each other , this will make adjacent USB ports unusable due to its size . However , it comes with a cable . If you use the cable , there is no issue with the space . My router is D-Link and I have enabled WEP . This works fine with my current setup . Sometimes when I restore my computer from standby or hybernate mode , the network is not recognized right away . Given enough time ( few seconds to a minute ) , I suspect that it will work . I get restless and force the connection ( via a few easy mouse clicks ) . I have absolutely no problem with that - but the expectations of my family members are higher than mine . The distance between the router and this device is considerable in my setup ( router stays upstairs in a room ) . It used to drop connections very often when used with one of my computers . I moved it to another computer now and it works very well . Both these computers are downstairs . Over the time , I have come to like this product very much and it work well .  
2	  I bought it while on sale and could not be happier . good quality tool laid out so that I can and have used as a right or left handed . I used to be a Mechanic and enjoy quality tools that make the job easier . Highly Recomend !  
1	  My first impression of these canals were the STATIC / noise / hiss ! It was faint but noticeable . The interesting thing was that the hiss was constant , no matter if I mute the volume or max it out . In other words the hiss did not get worse or better depending on the volume . I contacted Sennheiser and checked on numerous online forums . Sennheiser said that the sellers on Amazon are on their NON-AUTHORIZED sellers :[ .. ] [ .. ] This is what they told me : " Non-authorized dealers selling " legit " product have no relationship with Sennheiser . They may get their goods from a source that is questionable ; perhaps they are stolen , returned , refurbished ( even though they say they are new ) , new , old , counterfeit .. we have no idea . They may not have been stored in the proper environment ( were they in a truck for an entire winter with no heat ? ) and thus we cannot guarantee the product to perform as it would when going through the appropriate supply chain . " And their 2 year WARRANTY WILL NOT COVER you . The model CX 300 is especially easy to counterfeit judging from the simplicity in design . Even if they are real the quality may have dropped since Sennheiser has not manufactured them for a couple of years now . A friend of mine who is a musician say that there is a clear distortion when the volume is increased . And the number of other pairs of headphones I tested do not create the hissing sound . I bought a pair of CX 280 for double the price from a legit store and the difference in quality ( in terms of build and the hiss ) is stark . What I think is that the ones I bought were probably legit but the quality dropped significantly . Bottom line : Be careful even when buying from Amazon !  
2	  Let me begin by saying that I have been wanting and shopping for a DVD player for about a year and after literally going through and researching about 12 different players I decided on the Toshiba SD2200 . I decided right . The SD2200 provides wonerful sound whether connected to a surround sound system or just connected to a standard two speaker system with it 's simulated 3d surround you are truly immersed into the movie . Image quality is phenominal coming from a VHS watcher and music CD 's are crisp and clear . My reccomendation for anyone who may be looking for a CD player for their home system and also considering a DVD player - the Toshiba SD2200 will do both for you and do it well !  
2	  I use recipes on the internet a lot so I was constantly dragging my 15 " MBP in the kitchen with me . Now that I purchased the iPad 2 and this stand , life is so much easier . There is no room to charge it from the bottom but the great thing about the ipad is the screen oscillates so you can charge it upside down or landscape . Great price and flexibility !  
2	  I 'm fully pleased with the Kingston 2GB SD card . There are no shortcomings that I can perceive . Good price for 2GB .  
2	  This item is the best I 've owned so far . It has a very easy to use remote , so simple a child could operate it . The sound quality is very good , and the price is reasonable considering all the features it has . I use it daily .  
1	  I really want to love this machine but when I hooked it up via component connectors the red color was missing , so everything looked blue . Regular AV connectors did not have this problem but I have a digital TV so I want to use component video connectors only . First I thought the component wires were faulty , so I returned the wires to Radio Shack and bought the Monster brand connectors . It did the same thing - blue pictures no matter which movies I played . So I thought my TV must be defective ( it 's a Syntax Olivia 27 " brand new ) . But since returning a TV was a lot more troublesome , I decided to try a different DVD from a friend instead in case it was the DVD that was bad . I tried a Sony progressive DVD and the blue color was gone ! Now i knew it was the Philip DVD 's fault . I then bought another one of this DVD from my local Target store thinking that the same problem was highly unlikely to exist in both machines and boy was I wrong ! The red color was again missing ! It was so strange that this highly rated DVD could have an obvious color problems and nobody here mentioned it ! I later returned the Philips and bought a new Sony with no problem whatsoever . Perhaps I ignored some essential steps in configuring the machine but I couldn't find out any such info in the manual . If anyone of you think I made a mistake in someway please let me know .  
2	  Plugged it in and hooked up the cables and my Gigabit network came alive ! A definite increase in throughput . I found it to be very quiet , but if it 's the only equipment in your room and no other noise , I guess you can hear the fan . I can't hear it . No issues after several months of steady use .  
1	  The form 2 headphones are the worst hadphones i ever had . they have a amazing design but the rest is crap . i order this headphones and they take 1 month to arrive . on top of this the box was crumpled and damaged . the headphones didint had any protection inside the box . which i thought it was really strange becaue B & o ; is a top brand . i used them in a regular way ( 1-2 houres ) a day . and i treat them in a very nice way . in the 15th day the left speaker stoped working . the next day i take them to a B & O ; store . they told me that they would communicate with denmark . it took 3 weeks for sending the email an yet they didint respond fo the headphones . it trided to communicate with amazon but they told me that the problem had to be fix in B & O ; store . the problem has not been resolved . it has been 5 months and B & o ; havent respond yet for the headphones . Cons and ProsCons3 Year international warranty : this is false . if you buy them in another country they dont have warranty . Sound : I was really dissapointed with the sound of the headphones . it dosent have a good bass and mids . i am actually using a 15 $ sony headphones that have a better sound . Materials : the " metal " part get oxidated in a short period of time . considering this is a $ 100 headphone i was expecting more . Fragile : this product is very fragile . it very easy to brake . woudent recommend it if you ar putting them in a backpack a any type of bag . lack of case : the headphones dosent come with a case and B & o ; dont sell one . considering that the headphones are very fragile the should at least bring a case . ProsDesing : it has a wonderfull desing . many people have ask me were i bouhgt the headphonesWeight : they have an amazing weigth ( just 68g ) In conclsion i woudent recommend this headphones . the price is not right for what you get . they dont have good sound , materials , its realy fragile and the warranty of B & O ; sucks .  
1	  The Power 2000 line of chargers have been woefully awful in my experience . My first one worked for a while , then suddenly the batteries would not hold a charge . This was already a bad sign , since NiMH batteris are supposed to be long-life . Because I liked its compact size for travel , I decided to give this charger one more try . I purchased a current model , the Power 2000 XP-333 . Several hours after inserting the batteries properly and plugging the unit in , I noticed a burning electrical smell . When I traced the odor back to the new charger , I of course unplugged it and nearly burnt myself on the batteries , which were scorchingly hot . I fear they might have burst or started a fire had I left them in the charger any longer . There are too many other dependable charger makers - why take a chance on this unreliable , dangerous product ? This product should be rated zero stars - it 's earned a skull & crossbones warning in my opinion !  
2	  01/20/05 Update - I have used this monitor for several days and very impressed with the quality of the picture . It even looks good in a bright room . Highly recommended for text , photo editing and gaming . I am a computer tech and photographer and very fussy about what I like . I brought the NEC 90GX2 monitor several days ago and very satisfied so far . There are no dead pixels and the screen is bright with very clear text ( I replaced a Dell 19 " CTR which had very blurry text ) . I am into digital photo editing and am an online game player . Photographs look great and Call of Duty 2 looks great with no ghosting or other effects . It does have an OptiClear screen that 's very reflective and I would recommend looking at the display before purchase . In some environments it may have a reflection problem . The reason I only gave it a 4 is due to the poor documentation . It comes with a manual that doesn't clearly explain all the setup controls . You can download NaViSet software that gives on screen adjustment of the display . It 's a free download form NEC . It 's nifty software but NEC doesn't offer any online instructions on how to set the controls and some of the settings have no clear descriptions . I called NEC tech support , very short hold time . The problem was the tech new less then I did about NaViSet software and had to call someone else and still wasn't able to answer all my questions . I would recommend this monitor if you can afford the $ 500 price tag . It comes with a 3-year warranty and has well designed case .  
1	  I ordered a red ibeatle headset Organizer in February 2009 and received a silver iBeatle . I promptly called and told them of the wrong color and was told that the red was out of stock and they would send one free of charge when they were back in stock . It is the end of June 2009 , and my order has not been corrected , nor has there been any communications what the status is .  
1	  The Nanotune is awesome and I loved that I could take it everywhere , but it died after the second week of having it . I have exchanged it once before since it died a week after , now it died again . I wish I can find the manual to get my money back . It won't last if you buy it . Get some thing that holds it in place . The velcro that came with it slipped right off and it kept falling all over my car when I slowly went over a speed bump . Do not buy !  
1	  The longer I own this unit the less I like it . Command response is SLOW . Press a button and wait and wait for something to happen . Timed recording is iffy . Sometimes it records sometimes it doesn't . I am about ready to replace it with something else .  
2	  I am using this charger from last 6-8 months and so far it works like a dream . Have taken more than 500 pics on single charge with my S2 IS . Highly recommended .  
1	  I did a simple modification that increases its transmission range signifficantly . I took the unit appart and located where the antena from the pigtail cable attaches to the board . This is the fourth wire ( black ) Notice that the pigtail carries two coaxial audio wires and one antenna wire . I replaced this with about 2 feet 7 3/4 inches of 18G wire . The length is important for optimum transmission since this is about a fourth of the wavelength . It also required drilling a small hole in the case to get my new " antenna " out . I used a drill bit just thick enough to allow the wire to pass . With this antenna fully extended ( straight ) and provided it is NOT laid flat on a piece of metal ( such as along the floor of a car ) I could OVERPOWER 88.1 around Boston from my kitchen to my living room ( this is about 35 feet ) almost cleanly . Within the livingroom itself , signal was free from interference . That is a great improvement over original range . I suppose you could also use a dipole arrangement with two wires sticking out , one from the unit 's ground and another from the antena , both at the same length . That would further extend the range . Another configuration is a full wavelength antenna , about 10 feet long . But its hard to lay it straight . Many other configurations can extend range , but also diminish practicality , as its pretty hard enough to maintain 31 + inches of wire straight inside a car . I suggest attaching one end to your windshield or dashboard with a suction cup or velcro , etc . and letting the unit dangle from the antenna and audio out ( or somehow attach it to prevent strain . Be careful , as modifying your iRock in any way voids your warranty and it also renders the device illegal to operate . So remember NEVER to use it ;) . Also , use all common sense when locating this unit in your car , so it does not interfere with safe driving .  
2	  In searching for a HDTV , I was limited to a 37 " width constraint by my existing entertainment center . After researching the qualities of LCD , DLP , and plasma , I decided plasma was the way to go and this one at 36 " wide was a good fit . The only problem was with the H configuration of the table top stand . In order to flush mount the display with the front of the entertainment center , the front legs of the stand had to be cut back 5 " to keep them from protruding . We are extremely pleased with the quality of the almost 3-D pictures and I am most pleased at how easy it was for my technically challenged wife to master the remote . I highly recommend it .  
2	  I have been using American Battery Co . ( AB ) products for several years and have been reasonably satisfied with their performance . This time around the batteries in our APC SU1000RMNET UPS needed replacing . So I immediately went to Amazon for another RBC6 package from AB . These batteries are manufactured in China like all of the rest , imported in bulk by AB , packaged by AB , sold to Ingram Micro who has several distribution centers around the U.S. Without pay for shipping , I had my batteries a few days later ( shipped from Carrolton , TX to Houston , TX ) . Thinking that this would be a 20 minute swap out job , I immediately set about to swap out the batteries the afternoon the battery pack arrived . To my astonishment , these new batteries would not go into the UPS case . They were the same length and width as the old batteries , but were 1/8 inch taller . Inside the UPS case there are tabs or rails at the top to hold the battery down . The battery pack was solidly hitting the right tab - it needed another 1/16 inch to clear the newer battery . The left tab was high enough . I spent the next day trying to correspond with American Battery folks . Rosa , my normal contact , was on vacation , but Mike from another company was covering for her . Eventually I received an email back from Mike say that one of the VPs wanted pictures . So I had a dead UPS , they wanted pictures , but no offer to help me out of my problem . Today , Saturday , I decided to take the top off the UPS to get pictures and to see if I could modify the UPS to take the taller batteries . I send them the pictures and decided that if the right tab could be bent up by 20 degrees or so , the new taller batteries would fit . This is what I did to solve my problem . Summary - Old batteries had gray bottom shell and manufactured by BB Batteries , new batteries have cream colored bottom shell are 1/8 inch taller and do not indicate the battery manufacturer . The designation RBC6 is from APC and that company specifies the maximum dimensions for their Replacement Battery Cartridge ( RBC ) . So what is a few fractions of an inch between friends anyway ?  
2	  The 50 foot VGA cable that I ordered was delivered on time and it was exactly what I wanted . It works great . I have no complaints .  
2	  If you dont use much the color display , the battery charge last up to 2 hours  
2	  Astonishing performance for such a small package . If your laptop does not come with a webcam this is the one to get . It works with Skype HQ mode , whereas garden variety 1.3MP cams don't .  
2	  I think these speakers are a good buy . The sound is not the best , but is pretty high quality and I can hear it pretty clearly even when I am on a different floor in the house . The remote works great , adjusts volume and tracks easily , and even works through walls . This system also charges my iPods as it plays ( even my older iPod , which is about 4 years old ) , which is great since I lost my chargers . Overall I would recommend this product as a solid purchase for quality sound and convenience .  
1	  After about 2 years of use , my Panasonic DVD A-120 also started displaying " NO PLAY " on its front window , along with the message , " This Type of Disk Cannot Be Played . Please Insert A Different Disk " on my television . It started out only effecting a few rental movies , but now effects a majority of disks . I am going to buy a newer JVC or Panasonic DVD player to replace it . I have found many DVDs will play if I open and close the DVD tray several times . When this works , the DVDs play without any problems with all DVD functions available . For some disks , it takes an intolerable number of open and close cycles to get lucky . For others , it never works .  
2	  I got the router setup last week because I got a new computer for myself and wanted to have cable internet on it . I read MANY amazon . com reviews .. some bad .. some good .. it was very hard to make a decision . I finally decided to have somebody set it up for me . He set it up and so far it as worked without ANY problems except I think it has reduced my speed and the loading of the files on the other computer are slow . My brother hates it because it is hard to turn on the DMZ host option because you have to enable DNS and I don't know the information to enable it . Port forwarding doesn't work with all programs too . This is only because the firewall works very well . If you are looking for something to secure your network , you should get this product . It is easy to access the setup for the router but of course , DMZ hosting and port forwarding are under advanced so you should be advanced if you want to expose one of your computers to the internet without the firewall . I 've had no problems other than that whatsoever . I don't know what this thing about " hanging " is about . My connection never " hangs . " I 'm only 14 but I know what I 'm talking about - if this product has almost 500 reviews ( with a 4 star average ) why haven't you bought it yet ? It is great !  
1	  Both suction cups ripped within 2 weeks ! Used only a few times . Do not buy this product ! Looking for refund .  
1	  This item is not worth the couple of bucks I paid for it . The sound quality is absolutely horrible . All you can hear is static . I was so excited when I got this , but was thoroughly disappointed . Oh well , I guess I will stick to my FM transmitter .  
2	  I have owned my Zune since April . I waited six months to actually write a review to make sure I didn't eat my words . It has worked beautifully since I bought it . I have not had a single problem with it even the installation went smoothly . It is a bit bulky but it will fit in pockets ( even in girl jeans ) . I hated the headphones and bought some Skullcandy ear buds and the sound it awesome . I don't download music so I didn't have to deal with that . I had all my music in Windows Media Player and all of that moved over to the Zune software just fine . The Zune market place sucks but I have found other places to download music . I bought this player also because I use my computer as a DVR and it syncs beautifully with my Zune . And the large screen is really nice to watch TV on the go . Bottom line is that it is a great start for Microsoft and I am excited to see where they take it from here . I just wish they would have had the red one when I got mine but I still love my swamp brown one .  
1	  I had tried a pair of the Sennheiser 250 's . With those , you could hear a range of sound disapear and reapear as you turned them off and on . With these , you could hear a range of sound become slightly mufled . The noise canceling is extremely poor . Also , they are not very comfortable . The band digs into the top sides of my head . But the real killer is , they actually made you feel as if you have motion sickness . No kidding . Again , I 've tried other pairs of active noise cancelling headphones , and this did not occur  
2	  If you are trying to get a good quality charger , then Sony BCG-34HRMF4 is made for you . Pros : 1 ] Looks Good2 ] Battery Indicator . 3 ] Can charge single battery / cell at a time . 4 ] Auto power cut off5 ] Also works with 240V in Europe . 6 ] Sleek and light wiegth7 ] Refresh button - works really good to get ur battery life / power back . Cons : 1 ] Its fast but not that fast . It also depends on the Batteries you are using . 2 ] If started Refreshing , then will take more time [ still its good ]  
2	  I love them they have good bass sound and they don't hurt my ears like other ear bud earphones do .  
2	  It meets my needs for a scanner and copier . Copies are clear with good color . The only drawback is it doesn't have a handset to enable it to double as a phone , but it does have caller ID . For an inexpensive all-in-one , it serves my purpose just fine .  
1	  I had much difficulty with the card causing my mouse to freeze . When I looked up help on this problem it said to update the driver or bios . The driver was update so I decided to update the bios . Updating the bios destroyed my laptop and now it is totally useless .  
2	  Just bought this monitor and played " Matrix : Reloaded " . The picture quality is quite amazing . I also test drove Warcraft II and Quake 3 and the graphics look great with no apparent " ghosting " . I also see no pixel fusion for this monitor . Since i am an avid gamer , this monitor gets my " 2 Thumbs Up " . However , i use an ATI Radeon 9600 Pro w / 256 MB DDR ( using the DVI adapter ) . Not sure how this monitor would perform with a lower end graphics card .  
2	  The only problem is the viewfinder in hot sunlight , being an elderly it 's hard to see when you try to take a picture in bright sunlight on the outside , living in Florida . An additional Optic View finder would very much appreciated .  
1	  Read the product description carefully . The first half is dedicated to the flexible webcam arm / stand . This is the product I wanted . The second part is a rendevous pack ( condoms , etc . ) . This is NOT what I wanted , but that was what was shipped .  
1	  Holga 's are great cameras , but if you look around on the net or at a photo store you can find these plastic cameras for twenty to twenty five bones . The price for this " Lomographic " Holga Starter Kit is way over priced .. sure the packaging is a little nicer , but come on ! Don't get suckered into this . Look around a little and you 'll save big .  
1	  I bought this SW about a year ago , AWESOME bass ! I was very impressed with its sound quality . I compared it to much more expensive subs and found that the ASW10-120 outperformed them all , BUT .. about 8 months later , it fried . It was on a 100w receiver that barely got turned up beyond 1/4 volume , but yes , occasionally it got cranked . So I took it to and electronics guru friend of mine who looked it over and and stated that the amp was built with inferior circuits , and that to rebuild it with quality circuits would be worth more than the ASW10-120 if it were brand new . My advise : Do not buy it . Just google ASW10-120 problems . If you think you will not be cranking your sound up very loud then you don't need a sub , but if going to crank it up buy something that can handle the power . Like I said this 120w sub was on a 100w receiver . It didn't last .  
1	  Every thing was good except one of them last only 10 months . Very disappointed . I only use themonce a week .  
1	  This is a very well designed light and works very well . You have better control of the light vs . snake neck light types . The quailty of light put out is good and is not so bright as to create glare . There is one major flaw in this light . It has a very short life span . It died after only two months !  
1	  These are one of the worst earphones I 've ever experienced . The earphone is too thick , it doesn't fit my ear properly , keeps slipping and it hurts my ears . I bought them as a replacement for my overused and defunct Apple iPOD earphones and boy ! there 's a heaven and earth difference in the sound quality between the two .. so no no no .. I don't recommend this at all .. only redeeming feature is that you get two pairs .. so that you can prolong your misery in waiting for it to break up so that you can buy new ones .. I hate it !  
2	  I bought this to use on my PC for Skype . Plug and play , simply insert USB and off you go . Like the boom so I can point to where I am ( or others ) . I can recommend .  
1	  The transmitter relies on perfect line of sight and only seems to work when within 1 foot of the Transmitter ! The manual claims it has a range of 100 feet ? Remote IR extender cable has nice velcro attachment , but signal sends out the bottom requiring it to be attached to an * outside * glass door of any entertainment center . After having a great experience with the Leap Frog extender from Terk that truly did have a range of 150 feet - I 'm very disappointed with Jensen . I will be giving them a call tomorrow to give them a chance to at least fix their product or forget it . I 'll report more when I hear what they have to say .  
1	  This product works ok as a charger , but the line-out jack adds tons of static . I thought it was a problem with my car until I tried a Monster charger . The Monster charger adds no distortion and its line-out sounds great .  
1	  This hardware is well-made and I have heard very good things about the non-bluetooth version of the mouse . When it 's connected and working , it does its job very well . Unfortuntately the MX5000 set suffers from some very poorly made software that makes it very difficult to use effectively . At seemingly random intervals , the mouse will start lagging or stop altogether . If this happens during gameplay , you 're in a bad way . The keyboard also suffers from a truly annoying bug . When it comes off of its sleep state , it will double the first key you press . I have also had the keyboard just reset out of the blue . Add in that the SetPoint software for the LCD screen only fully works with two pieces of software ( MusicMatch and Windows Messenger ) , and you have a very disappointing desktop package . The MX1000 is a great mouse on its own , but stay away from this Bluetooth combo . It is unstable and very frustrating to use .  
2	  I love this cable . It 's just the right length and does the job perfectly . It was packaged perfectly and was shipped very quickly . The way my office is configured , I couldn't put the color printer near enough to my computer and every time I wanted to print in color , I had to undock my laptop and move it close enough . This cord was a lifesaver ! Buy it , you won't be sorry !  
2	  This deck has better high frequency response than my old Teac V-66C ( died from a loose belt ) . No Dolby C , but my old tapes sound fine with B. It does clunk when stopping or reversing but that is a nit . I am extremely happy to hear how good my old tapes sound !  
2	  I 've done my homework on these phones , and the one thing I 've heard is that every pair seems to be different . According to some sites , V-Moda has a reputation of changing the freq curve of different models , sometimes on a production to production basis . That said , it 's half the reason I bought these - I like a company that has that much devotion to making a good product . When I first received them , they didn't sound worth the 85 bucks I paid for them . They were pretty good in the bass department but seemed average everywhere else , comparable to a pair of bad Sony EX-71 's . I put them away after a few songs , and when I came back to them they were the worst sounding phones I 've ever heard . The bass was muddy , the mids were muddier , and the highs were unlistenable . It sounded like an AM transmission . However , if you 're looking into buying in-ear canalphones you should be aware that every pair must incur a burn-in period , in which the phones level themselves out and the magnets stretch their muscles . After about 6 hours of burn time ( just put your mp3 player on shuffle for a while ) , the Vibes sound GREAT . The bass thumps , the mids are very cool , but the thing that truly strikes my fancy is the control in the highs . I do like my bass but it seems most of the time companies spend more time working on bass and forgetting about highs . If I listen to a pair of " true " Shure e2c 's or Etymotic er-6i 's , the " honest " highs are too shrill . With the Vibe pair , you 're still getting a noticeable difference between a high and a mid but the high has a very mild , west-coast , laid back feel to it . A shredding solo isn't painful to listen to . Everything on these phones fit my style perfectly . However , if you 're expecting a pair of phones that will TRULY represent every high on every song , don't get these . Some other cool things : - That fruity-looking gold bag was actually black , which is a very nice touch . - The phones feel extremely comfortable in my ear ; more comfy than the unprecedented ex-71 . - The cord is the perfect length . The only setbeck , so far , is the cord itself . The red cord is protected in rubber , but it doesn't feel good against the skin . Also , it isn't very good plastic ; it is comparable to the plastic companies use to protect speaker wire .  
2	  I really love a lot of things about this camera . ThePROS : Image is the usual canon quality . Like the new iso 800 and image stabilization . Cons : My videos are marred by this whirring sound .. I sure hope they fix this , its quite annoying . Maybe I should have gotten the SD630 ?  
2	  The first unit we received was defective but was replaced very promptly . The replacement unit does just what it is supposed to do . The only thing that keeps it from being 5 star is the fact that the first one didn't work so it leaves a nagging reliability question in the back of my mind .  
2	  I bought this charger for use with my digital camera ( Canon Powershot ) . I love it , it charges relatively quickly and shuts off when fully charged so there is no risk of over charging the batteries . I have not noticed the unit becoming hot or even warm during charging as someone else comented on . It is very compact which makes it easy to travel with . As it has dual voltage with the right converter you can use it anywhere . I have used mine in Ireland , England and New Zealand with no problems . The ability to charge either 2 or 4 batteries is also a nice feature . In my camera the batteries have what I find to be a good amount of life before they need to be recharged . I have accidentally popped the cover off when opening but it pops back on just as easily . I am completely satisfied with this charger and batteries for digital camera usage and recommend it .  
1	  This is for a PowerMac G5 , or so the label says . I haven't tried this on older G4 computers so I don't know if this really needs a driver that 's built in a G5 or something . I got this for the heck of checking what it can do for me . Nothing really . 1 . First of you have to know that this adapter connects to the DVI port , not the old ADC port . What this means is that the Aluminum displays for the G5 model use DVI . This being the case , then you have a problem right there to fight over the port . Unless you have the high-end optional nVidia GT card with dual-DVI port , then the stock ATI 9600/9800 cards come with one DVI and one ADC . So I would think people with G5 have or are thinking of upgrading to the Aluminum display then you will be needing an ADC to DVI converter to hold the monitor and TV at the same time . That makes using the two " monitors " with respective adaptors . Why ? ! Unless Apple envisioned phasing out the ADC port soon , it makes no sense . And if they did envision to phase out the ADC then why release cards with the G5 that still have an ADC port if the new monitors use DVI and this adapter also uses DVI . Are they trying to make money selling adapters ? 2 . I haven't seen a perfect computer to TV interface from major video card manufacturers the same way Matrox has perfected it . What Matrox has done for dual monitors with one using a TV is that it automatically routes the video signal to the TV . If it detects your playing a movie file , it just brings it out to the TV as a full screen . No need to drag your windows into that screen and then making it into full screen . This adapter and the software interface doesn't do it . It just makes your TV into another monitor with extremely low resolution , naturally . The point of adding a TV as a monitor is to obviously put make multimedia viewing experience more enjoyable and hassle-free . If you play a QuickTime file or a DVD movie in your computer , you would want it to be played on your TV . Nope , not here . You will have to drag it then make it full screen . But it doesn't stop there . Try opening another application and that full screen on the TV monitors automatically switches back into one within a window . Very stupid and annoying . So I believe they should follow the footsteps of Matrox and create a custom software that will allow to do just that . Put a check box if you want your video automatically output on the TV , on a window , in the first monitor , second monitor , etc . 3 . The above suggestion actually works with Final Cut Pro application . But if you 're a video editor , you really wont even need this . You see once you connect your TV via this adapter then you can route your TV as your monitor which is good to check the actual picture quality on a TV screen . It is a cheap solution . However , if you are editing on Final Cut Pro then it would be natural that you have either a video editing card that can output to a TV / monitor while keeping your dual computer monitor active for editing . Or , you have a camcorder with FireWire output or some other similar solution that you can use to route from the computer to camcorder to TV . Using FireWire is actually a better solution that this adapter because it DOES NOT allocate video card memory to the TV via the adapter . By using the adapter to connect to the TV you are eating up video memory between the computer monitor and the TV . So if you have 128MB memory then 64MB goes to each . This slows down the video information and will be evident if you are using big computer screens . By using FireWire the video card does not interfere and allocates full memory to your computer monitor . 4 . The OS isn't even perfect with interfacing to the adapter . You connect the adapter and you 'll need to constantly restart the computer whenever you connect / disconnect it . Simply putting the computer to sleep and waking it won't work . Your video card still thinks the TV is connected despite having no TV nor adapter ( after waking from sleep ) . Shut down the computer , remove the adapter then start to make sure all video card memory is allocated back to your computer monitor . So unless you have a high end video card that can afford to split the memory and an interface that automatically routes the video signal to your TV , this is pretty useless . It 's just for fun to prove that you can output part of your screen to your TV with hassle and all . Skip until they improve the software .  
1	  Audio CDs do not play in most CD players . This burner is a total piece of junk for making audio CDs . Stay away .  
1	  I have used an Olympus model VN-4100PC voice recorder for several years . It works great ! You can transfer files from the recorder to the computer . The only drawback is that you cannot download from the computer to the recorder . Battery life is good . Storage of files is good . Sound is loud and clear ! Along comes the newly released Olympus WS-710M . It is loaded with features and memory ! You can transfer files from the recorder to the computer ; and from the computer to the recorder . Great ! It has 8GB of memory Plus it has a slot for a microSD card . You can read for yourself all of the wonderful features that it has . You can download your music to it and use it as a MP3 player . And it has a FM radio included . ( Not a really big deal , but it is nice . ) I just received it today ; Thursday , October 7 , 2010 . I played with it all day . I am NOT happy with it ! I am very disappointed ! Why ? The sound . The sound or volume level is only half of what the Olympus model VN-4100PC is . Actually , it is LESS than half ! Both recorders have a volume ' meter ' that goes to 30 . At the highest , 30 , the Olympus WS-710M is barely heard . At the highest , 30 , the Olympus VN-4100PC can be heard ; it is loud and clear . I can listen to the VN-4100PC in the car , I can listen to it in the kitchen , I can listen to it sitting outside , and I can listen to it in my living room . I can take it anywhere and listen to it and hear it . With the headphones and without them ; especially without them ! I listen to it mostly without the headphones . I have to strain to hear the new Olympus WS-710M.That is why I am very disappointed . I have used a voice recorder to record lectures . I like to listen to those lectures . I barely can hear anything out of the Olympus WS-710M.I will try to return the Olympus WS-710M.I will return to using my Olympus VN-4100PC . It truly is good . But I will still be looking for something with the expanded memory ( 8GB ) and the additional features that the WS-710M promised but did not deliver .  
2	  I got this IXUS V3 ( powershot s230 ELPH ) just 2 nights ago and has taken close to 150 shots . This is my first digital camera which i got after months of research . I was skeptical about the small size as it makes the handling of the camera a lot harder but it turned out otherwise . The photo quality was astonishing for both indoor and out door shots . Pictures taken in perfect darkness turned out as if i had taken them during the day while day-shots turned out vividly . I was disappointed by the flash when taking macro objects as the falsh did not trottle down , so , i ended up taking it in manual mode without flash . Having used a manual SLR camera before , I chose to ues the manual mode when taking indoor shots , giving me the freedom of deciding how i would like the photo to turn out ( if you find that indoor shots turn out blur , do increase the ISO speed in manual ) . One thing i felt was missing was the apature mode . Red eye was not really a problem for me ( it has yet to turn up in any of my shots ) . Playing the pictures back on the television is not a problem as long as you have a cd-rw drive . You can burn it as a VCD using the provided video editing software . It performs very well as a point and shoot camera but , I would recommend at least a 128 mb card .  
2	  I use the Pic N Roll every day at work to play music continually throughout the day , and I have to say it works pretty well . My only concern is there is no " screensaver " function so the LCD is continually lit . You could probably get more battery life if it had that option , but again it 's a minor complaint . I will admit the headphones aren't the best but hey they 're free . I bought this for the player , not the headphones .  
2	  Expecting the device to work " of the box " I plugged it in expecting some result . Apparently the installation is relatively tricky and somewhat lengthy , requiring existing internet , before making the router working . I installed in in " wired " mode with my desktop first . That required 2 hours customer support , which I found very helpful and prompt . We almost gave up , then switched cables PC-to-router with router-modem . One of which ( blue ) came in box and another I found in old computer pile . To make it short - after install with desktop it works for about three weeks now without any problem with my wireless laptop .  
2	  This is a good product to buy , specially for the acer aspire one laptops :-)  
1	  I bought the camcorder for my grandson as a Christmas present . He didn't get a chance to use it because the battery wouldn't charge . It was returned in exchange for a gift card .  
2	  This has helped me to get signal where it was difficult to receive . This has helped me to get signal where it was difficult to receive .  
2	  I really can't understand how everyone else hates this thing , but let me give you my 2 cents . I think it 's great ! I received this as a gift from my sister for Christmas , and I am shocked to see that the price is under 40 bucks ! What I like : - sleek , aesthetic black design - nice , easy-to-read green display - two settable alarms - one for the buzzer and one for the radio - easy to set the clock or alarm time ; intuitive , with both forward and back buttons with slow / fast speed ( basically ) - decent reception on the radioI guess my only quibble would be that the single speaker is not exactly Bose-quality , but I have a stereo system for that .. I just want to listen to Howard Stern 's annoying * to wake up in the morning . Good thing the station I listen to isn't owned by ClearChannel .. Oh , and I 'm not sure , but maybe I have accidentally hit the Alarm Cancel button when trying for Snooze before , but I have been known to shut off other alarms in my sleep as well , so I can't crucify the alarm for that . The bottom line is that compared to most others out there you can get at the store , it really is a nice alarm clock . No stupid looking cheap white plastic , no impossible to figure out clock , option to set both the radio and buzzer alarms .. it 's all good stuff . If my house burned down and I was looking for another alarm clock , I would buy this one for sure ! No competition .  
2	  This is a fantastic product . I am a new hobby photographer and had to figure out everything myself , so I hope other newbies find these suggestions helpful . Xsi body + 70-200 f / 4 IS USM.I use this strap like a rifle shoulder tactical on my right armpit ( hope that 's the correct terminology ) ( The way Kyle Reese used his shotgun in Terminator ) How to make : This strap comes with a 2 little silver " keychain " rings and 2 leather loops ( to protect body from metal ) . Loop each leather into ring . Loop the silver rings into the body 's metal strap-holders . Thread strap through the rings ( instead of the body ) and through the leather to hold leather in place ( adjust leather so it faces toward the body ) . The purpose of the metal loops is to change the angle that the strap attaches to the body so the camera can face down , not forward , while being hung . I made my strap as long as it can - so the camera rests at the right waist ( ie R-strap resting location ) . One last step - additionally clip one of the quick-release into the other side ( right next to the other QR ) to make a shoulder / armpit loop out of the strap portion . The strap should snugly hug your right armpit and the camera should dangle to your right waist . The extra vertex in the right armpit adds additional stability , especially while the strap is slack while the body is raised when taking photos . You wouldn't need to worry about the strap falling down your elbows while taking photos . You can use your right hand to lightly hug it to your waist while walking . When I remove camera from messenger bag ( worn from right shoulder to left waist ) , I put the sling on first , then remove the camera . Reverse for putting camera back in . Have fun !  
2	  I decided to purchase this mp3 player after giving heavy consideration to the iRiver and iAudio players . My primary reason for picking this player was that at the time that I bought it , Amazon had it at a special sale price of $ 82.99 . That 's less than how much you have to pay to get a 128 MB iriver or iAudio player . I received this player a couple of days ago and have been playing with it since . I didn't install the software but plugged the player straight into my Computer and uploaded songs . My computer unfortunately doesn't support USB 2.0 so the transfer was slow , so I would recommend that you check if your computer supports USB 2.0 or not . If it doesn't , the MuVo NX is a cheaper alternate option . I uploaded my songs in folders since they are organized in albums . I was able to fit 3 full albums and 10 more miscellaneous songs , mostly ripped at 192kbps . I feel that the LCD screen and the controls are a bit too small , but I was able to get used to them and did like the scroll-wheel feature . The MuVo is feature-packed . It provides standard repeat and shuffle features , has a customizable equalizer , a voice recorder , the ability to skip from folder to folder , and set various screen options . The sound was excellent when I set the equalizer to my liking . I listen to a lot of bass-heavy music , so I cranked up the bass , and even using the included headphones the music sounded great . The included ear-phones did sound decent and sounded better than comparable stock-headphones . I 'm still waiting for my Senn PX100 headphones to arrive . Overall , this is an excellent little player . I was amazed at how small and light it is , and it is extremely convenient to carry it around . I would definately recommend this .  
1	  The speakers have great sound but after 6 months the speakers would quit without warning . I checked Klipsch message board and this seemed to be a common problem .  
2	  Great ! Now I can take my music wherever I go . Just in a small case ( really small ) and a couple of wires I can listen to , my favourite music in any place . If you are not eighteen and don't have thousands of songs that you wanted to listen ( I dont have even a thounsand ) 4 Gb it 's more than enought ( I already have 700 and it 's not full ) .  
2	  I can't believe how easy this was . In about fifteen minutes I had FAST wireless access from my basement to my family room upstairs , where my wireless signal could not reach only minutes earlier . Even though Netgear doesn't list Macs as supported on the box , that 's what I have and it works like a charm with the Airport express in my ibook . I can't imagine an easier solution to extending your wireless signal throughout the house .  
1	  Big blotches on all printed pages .. Not usable for even the lowest printing needs . Nothing more to say about this product  
1	  I learned my lesson the hard way with this software . From now on I will read the reviews before I purchase any software of this nature . I spent $ 50 on 123 Copy DVD old 2010 to create backup for my DVD 's and then spent all day trying to figure the software out . No directions , nothing to help out whatsoever . Tried going to 123 website and that didn't work either . The tutorial wouldn't work , the online tech support would not submit , there is no number to call .. nothing . Save yourself the headache and find something better .  
2	  I bought this for my husband and gave it to him before Christmas . My husband really loves this . One issue is , it needs a better antena . I had an extra wire antena that I put on the radio for better reception . The sound is amazing and for such a little radio it has a high output of volume . ( my husband is hard of hearing , so this was important ) . I would recommend this to anyone who wants to listen to world wide broadcast without having to spend a lot of money for a bigger radio .  
1	  This is a very inexpensive combination , but you get what you pay for . I really bought it for the tripod , so I can't complain too much , and the tripod itself is moderate .. Could be sturdier . The bag , however , is WAY too small , and only has two pockets to place things .  
1	  I have been unable to test the remote as well . I thought my batteries were dead and went out and replaced them . It still doesn't work and now it is past the & # 34 ; deadline & # 34 ; to return the product .  
1	  If you 're a fellow Apple-loather and looking for a viable alternative .. this , sadly , is not it . The software is the first problem . It crashes frequently and sometimes fails to rip the last song on the CD for no discernable reason . It often fails to convert video files to a format it can understand . Every time you attempt to synch it will try to install Microsoft Outlook on your PC . Simply plugging your Zen into the PC will result in the Zen searching folders for any multimedia it finds and adding it to your player . The player itself has a battery life that decreases noticeably with time . Recharging the player is also a pain since Creative requires you to plug a special widget into the device before it will accept a USB cable . Unless you carry the widget around with you , you 're out of luck when you 're out of power . The unit also crashes too frequently for comfort , either by freezing up ( which necessitates finding a paper clip and using the reset hole at the bottom of the unit ) or by simply going black . In either case , the player then " rebuilds " itself which takes perhaps 20-30 minutes . The interface responds erratically to finger input , and I often find myself being asked to rate songs when all I wanted to do was go back to the previous screen . The " random selection " function is also far less random than one would expect . I 'm already out of space on my Zen and will not be buying another one .  
1	  I purchased this product , charged it , downloaded songs onto it , attempted to play it , screen went black and hasn't turned back on since . Waste of money !  
1	  Terrible product , don't waste your money . The photo quality is horrid even at the highest resolution setting and , if the batteries die ( which they did after just four hours ) , all of the photos are erased .  
1	  Nothing else to say really . The device broke right after the warranty expired . Great while it lasted but will never trust Apple again  
1	  In theory this camera should have been the fore front of wireless camera technology because every other product released by linksys is Grade " A " high quality . This camera however does not perform worth a damn . It does nothing it is supposed to do especially if you don't have a degree in Computer Science . The Linksys DDNS service doesn't work right the camera does not e-mail the way it was promised , I am an IT professional and I can't figure out why the damn thing won't work Stay away from this product it will only cost you hours of problems and in the end just get filed in your junk drawer  
1	  Spend your money on something else . The antennas are barely hanging on by a couple of very thin wires that will break eventually and then it 's toast . I ditched cable , so I watch TV programs over the internet by connecting my laptop to the TV in the bedroom and stream it to a TV in the living room . I also used it with my wireless security cameras . The quality could be better , but that was my trade-off over spending more money on a new TV with built-in Wi-Fi , or buying another converter box for my older model TV . I gave it one star , because of the poor antenna design . I only had it a couple of months before the antenna wires on the transmitter broke and no longer works .  
2	  I like all Tiffen filter products and this one ( I have sevral others ) continues to meet all expectations . I recommend it highly .  
1	  After reading all the wonderful reviews of this product it seemed to be perfect to store and use for my small home network instead of the other three computers getting data from my main computer . I had hoped it would be as easy and as lighting fast as I had read . It was not , not even close . Tech support is poor ; performance of this product is extremely poor . It would take my other computers about 20-25 seconds to access the main database I use , now with this Netdisk it is at least 58 second or more . Even accessing the data the performance is sluggish and in no way worth the money spent . Tech support said I had an old driver . I installed the new driver with no change . Do not invest any money in this product if speed is what you want .  
2	  i love this item i use several labels but so far this is my fav and will be reordering it in the future  
2	  Needed this thing for my brand new 47 & # 34 ; HDTV . I think that stands for Hard D * Television ? Well , it does on my TV . Don't buy a cable that is longer than you need due to the price .  
1	  This design didn't pull enough heat away from my Sony VAIO laptop that always ran hot - not sure anything in production now would work perfectly , but I know this one didn't .  
2	  This shower radio is the best one we have ever had ! In the past we have had trouble getting clear reception on the channel my husband likes to listen to , but with this radio it 's clear . I would highly recommend this radio to others .  
2	  This is exactly the answer to my problem of where to put the sensor . It is very snug and I never worry about losing it ! I have done some 5k 's and no issues ..  
1	  I just bought this little device . I have had nothing but problems with it since day one . I have wrote tech . support and they have not been very supportive . They did say they were sorry that their software wasnt working with my computer . It has worked a couple of times but with no sound or color . And yes I have set the conf . every different way possible .  
1	  I can't add much to what is already written in every other review here . This is junk hardware of the worst kind . I am seriously considering dumping DirecTV , after being a subscriber since 1999 ( aside from a 1-year diversion to Dish ) . Their customer service for this lemon of a device absolutely sucks . I can no longer trust them to provide reliable service or stand behind their products . This is a disaster . Do NOT purchase !  
2	  I was a little concerned about buying this after reading some of the negative reviews but I 'm happy to say it works quite well . Were using this at home to scan real estate docs & it handles the mix of letter & legal size pages just fine with no jamming ( thus far anyway ) . Its not nearly as fast as the scanner at the office but that one cost about 5X more $ ! The good thing about going with HP is they have great support & software updates . I 've used it on both the Mac & the PC without any issues to speak of .  
2	  I initially purchased this item through AMAZON . It arrived in a timely manner however the packaging was damaged to some degree . The unit would not turn on . The people at Garmin were helpful but the unit refused to work and we were unable to identify the problem . I used AMAZON 's return procedure ( which is very simple and which simultaneously ordered a replacement even before I returned the defective unit ) and was pleased to receive the new unit in a couple of days . This unit is superb , easy to operate and thus far hasn't gotten me lost . I would recommend the dash mount however as I didn't feel comfortable relying on the suction cup when I hit bumps . In spite of a rocky start , I recommend this unit to anyone , especially the tech challenged .  
1	  The features do not remotely live up to the hype . The base map is close to useless and without the addition to the add on map , will do no more than a $ 150 gps . If I still had the box , I would send it back  
1	  Beware of this product , as the DVD player will stop working whenever you least expect it . Stay away from Magavox for quality products !  
1	  This cable is great for about 5 months . After that the cable started to short out at the ends with sound only coming in for the left side . I would buy a beefier cable if you plan on using it daily like I did .  
1	  Very effective at protecting privacy . Impossible to view the screen from an angle . BUT , way too much glare .. reading the edges of the screen is nearly impossible , even looking straight on .  
1	  For about a decade I always have bought HP printers . The one before this one was a Photsmart 1100 , or something like that and it worked great for 3-5 years so when it dies I decide to get one that is a scanner also and I settle for HP because they are always good , right ? No , the piece of offal jams constantly . I get the " paper try empty " error even after it has grabbed up a bit of paper . I hate hate hate hate hate hate hate this printer . It stops working right only months after buying it and then only using it two or three times . I don't want to clean rollers I want to print but even cleaning rollers doesn't help . I 'm sure the CEO of HP is getting a big bonus for shoving this evil onto the poor hapless user who thinks HP is good quality because CEO 's always get big bonuses especially if they drive the company into the ground and this printer makes me hate HP and never buy them again so stockholder take note : Big big bonus for CEO  
1	  Now you have been warned . The product is truly the worst and the most time consuming electronic device that I have encountered . I spent 10 + hours trying to get it to work - referencing reviews / suggestions here and on other forums , in addition to Linksys technical support . Finally , I was able to get the device to link to the router ( both blue lights ) , but the device did nothing to improve signal coverage in my home . I am very disappointed , but clearly I am not fully without fault , as I was plenty warned by others who have conveyed similar experiences . John Chambers should be ashamed of himself for allowing Cisco to release such a shoddy product .  
2	  Easy to open & close ; easy on the eyes ; not as opaque as other colored clamshells so easy to read label on CD / DVD inside ; the rack is a BIG bonus !  
2	  This is a heavy duty organizer , sits on the desk or hangs on the wall . Plenty of trays for everything I have and a place to label each tray . Thinking of buying another one or a project I am doing .  
2	  Pros : Compact , light weight , lifetime warranty , great sound for size / price . Moving around much ? They have a tight grip on your head . Durable , I once stepped on them causing one of the ear pieces to pop off and I simply clicked it back into place like nothing happened . Short cord for people who don't wander 20 feet away from their audio player ( laptop , mp3 player ) like some other headphones have . Cons : I 've heard people say how comfy they are , but my hat size of 7 1/2 says very different . After a few hours they simply prove to tight and give me a headache . And that 's whether I have sound running through them or not . On occasion a hair might get caught in the metal band but not enough of a problem to warrant not getting them . I use these for my laptop and iPod and they do an excellent job with music and gaming . Base is kinda bad but for the size and cost it does more then enough . Mine have the straight plug which is really annoying as I like the 90 deg ones much better but it works regardless . I 'd recommend these to other people . The only drawback I can find is they can give me a headache of using them for a couple hours . Maybe if you have a smaller head you 'll be ok ? They can seem flimsy , but I 've had them for 2 years and have traveled with them so I couldn't justify and claims of them being " cheap " headphones . And with a lifetime warranty I say go to town . I don't use the case at all either , used to , but I deemed it to much of a hassle and lost it somewhere . No regrets on that . I would give the product 5 stars but the headache thing really detracts from them . I still like and use my pair and if you want some cheap good headphones I 'd go with these again any day of the week . ( Maybe not Tuesday )  
1	  Paid for but never received . Contacted company but they said they were waiting for product to be returned .. so wait .. does that mean I 'm paying for something I didnt receive ? Looks that way ! Been over 2 months now and no credit or reshipment . Very pissed !  
1	  It takes 2 weeks to get it . very slowand there is no adaptor . I wish I can receive the adaptor as soon as possible .  
1	  I 'm very disapointed with this DVD because : 1 . Freezes with my DVD-RAM disks . I know they 're better than normal RW . I send 2 times to the technic service and they recommend me to use better disks ( I don't know where I can find it ! ) . When disconected and connected again , run normally for a while , so the technic service can't find the problem in 2 weeks and they return me . I have to film the problem to explain it , they told me have fixed the problem and now the DVD goes to the technic service for third time . Update : Now I have problems with the RW disks also . 2 . The remote control is UN-natural3 . Fast Forward or rewind is not FAST !  
1	  The remote and the receiver could not communicate . Waste of my return shipping cost .  
1	  I 'm trying to back up movies that I took on vacation ( JVC Camcorder ) and loaded in the Everio Media Browser software by Pixela . I can't make these disks work . I suspect the slow speed ( 8X ) is a hang up , but Pixela can't help . Their program doesn't offer a speed setting , so nothing to do but watch the error message come up . I 'm not a computer expert , but just a user , however , some hint that this could be a problem would have been nice .  
1	  Tried to set up but wouldn't let me go past step three , ( it would not let me set up any channels ) called eleven differnt phone numbers for RCA with no one willing to help . Got frustrated and just sending the item back . If RCA is going to build and sell an item they should have someone within one to two calls who will help you set the unit up .  
1	  I bought this battery and it only powered my laptop for just a little over one hour so I returned it and got my money back and bought a Novuscell brand external laptop battery from The Battery Geeks website which powers my laptop for over 7 hours per charge and also charges my iPad and iPhone .  
1	  This is pretty much the worst DVD player ever created . I have noticed that the price on this piece of $ # ! % has been going down steadily for weeks . The problem with mine was that the audio and the visual did not seem to want to be on the same page , and yeah , that 's kind of not good . I used it with two different TVs and had the same problem ; you get through about 50 minutes or so of a disc and you can clearly see that the mouths are moving but they aren't saying the things coming out of the speakers . Save your money and buy a better DVD player or wait until the high def war has come to an end because progressive scan doesn't mean $ # % ! anyway .  
2	  I have a 30 gb ipod , and have had several mp3 players before . This 2 gb device was purchased for my jogs . It performs wonderfully . There is a short learning curve to organizing songs into folders , but I love the sound and the tiny featherweight package is easy to carry about . The radio is not as good as the one on my old iaudio , but still it picks up the local stations well enough . If the radio were a bit stronger , it would get 5 stars . Highly recommended for joggers .  
1	  I bought this mic about a year ago for a sony SR7 , and when I mounted it on the camera I could barely tell the difference between it and the onboard mic . I recommend getting the RODE video mic that has significantly better sound quality . Also , the mic broke not long after I bought it . I really wasn't too disappointed though .  
1	  I received the Sony DCC-E345 DC adapor and put it to use to power a CD player in the car . Product initally worked for a short time then started to work intermittently after a couple of uses . After a couple of days teh product stopped working altogether . I would not purchase another DC adaptor from Sony . Sony DCC-E345 Car DC Adaptor with Selectable Voltage Switch  
1	  After a couple of days the cartridge stopped working . I 'm going to order an official one from Samsung . This is the second time that a " compatible " toner cartridge failed . Thank goodness for Amazon 's great return policy .  
2	  This is the best mp3 player on the the market . The sound is wonderful , its small and compact . it has a nice metal frame giving it a sturdy feel . A wonderful lcd . But again if people said the sound is bad they most be deaf because its perfect for me . Not to mention its a voice recorder too . its really a 4 in one deal . Voice and radio recorder , mp3 player , and a big floppy disk . the only problem might be is that there is no problems . i have had mine for 5 months and the quality hasnt faded a bit . Its a beautiful working gadget with great software to boot . If your looking for a powerful mp3 player that can be upgrade with sd cards :) this the one for you . Its easy and simple to use . Go for it .  
1	  If you want to listen to music and never want to expose it to the weather or the gym its probably fine . But it took only three trips to the gym and it died . I did have it in a protective cover but just the little sweat on my hands after the workout when I turned it off was too much . My Nano has being going strong for months .  
1	  I cannot believe all the good reviews on this lamp . I had mine all of 3 weeks when it died . It was not from the bulb burning out ( I replaced the bulb because I thought that was what was wrong ) . It just died . My nephew ( a stage lighting tech ) finally took it apart for me to check the wiring and connections and the thing looked intact : it just didn't work . I cannot recommend this product at all . Maybe I got the only lemon in the pack but that 's enough to keep me away from investing in another one . I 'm giving it one star just for the idea . It is a good idea yielding poor results in my reality .  
1	  I bought this product thinking that it would be a good addition to my laptop . Wow .. I was wrong . To start off , I was surprised by the size of the product - It is bulky , requires an external power supply AND an external firewire converter that plugs onto the unit . Next after looking over the case , I could tell it was super cheap quality . The plastic and lid begged to be broken or cracked in a laptop bag . Finally I decided to try to burn some CD 's . After making 12 CD coasters , I packed it up and sent it back . The only successful burn I did was using the CDR that came in the box at a 2X burn speed . All my other tests failed . In addition , the Adaptec add-on that comes with Media Player didn't recognize the drive . I think Iomega needs to redo their drivers and fix a few things . This product is half-baked and needs to go back for reengineering .  
1	  Well , one good thing is the sound quality has improved from the last one ( 4G , color iPod , no video ) but the fact that the EQ still is mind-blowingly-horrible is not very good . I also don't like the fact that FM doesn't come with it ( i have to buy a $ 50 dollar remote ? HELLO RIPOFF ) . The screen is also very very nice , but they still have the problem with 1/5th the colors of all other screens out their ( have you seen the creative Vision : M compared to the iPod ? It has 5 times the colors ) . Also the battery life . 2 Hours for video ? I can't even watch a full movie without it dying . That sucks for travel . Then their comes the iTunes part . Eh . I 'd rather have control of my music thank you , and too bad theres no Drag and Drop . Also the fact that it doesn't work with any Music Subscription Service ( except the iTunes , of course ) . No other recording features either . I 'm returning this . Apple can do better then this . They should figure out how to stick a FM tuner as well as get recording features without me having to pay an extra 50 bucks a piece for each of those features .  
1	  Ok , in terms of the mouse itself , it feels nice and all buttons feel and look good . The BIG problem is that the Logitech software that you need to install to be able to program the buttons and scroll wheel causes the Mac to freeze up and crash . As soon as you uninstall the software then the Mac is fine . For reference , I am running a Macbook 2.0 Core Duo with 2 GB Ram and 80GB Harddrive , 13.3inch ( black one ) . So for Mac owners beware . I am returning this mouse back to Amazon . The mouse works but you can't use any of the programmable buttons which kills the whole point of buying a mouse like this .  
2	  Update ! ( June 2009 ) After the digital conversion , this booster was boosting the signal too much . I removed it and now it all works well . I find this hard to believe since I am splitting my little antenna 8 ways and then two of the 8-way splits are split in half once more . Everything still works w / o this amp . now . Crazy ! Original posting ) I purchase this to use with my DTV antenna that I am installing on my roof . I have to split the signal 8-ways , so a signal booster is called for . This booster seemed like a good one since it did not have any gimmicky splitters built in like others I have seen . My house has a big central wiring panel and I have a very good splitter in the panel . I know that putting the booster when there is only one cable / TV unit in the line and the signal is already good is not going to help ; it actually can deteriorate the signal . This did exactly that . But , once I hooked up this amplifier to the exterior antenna and then to the house splitter ( I only have 3 TVs hooked up , but since the splitter is an 8-way splitter it is still dropping the signal ) everything worked much better than I expected ! I have no signal loss at my DTV receivers . I find this hard to believe , but that is what the meters say on the receivers . There is no difference between having the antenna cable hooked up directly to 1 TV and having the booster , the splitter and the three TVs / receivers . I should remove the booster and see what happens , but since everything is working so well I don't want to mess with it . I guess I lucked out .  
1	  I bought this product a couple weeks ago and at first it seemed fine , but then I noticed that when it was turned on , the control wheel becomes uni-directional . What I mean by this is no matter which way you turn the wheel , the control only scrolls in one direction . This is OK , but frustrating , for some things like ISO and white balance , but it makes the exposure compensation wheel useless . It only moves in the negative direction and once it reaches -2 , it is stuck there and will not come back up . This is true whether using the control wheel on the camera or the one on the grip . I am hoping I can return it and if so , will spend the extra $ to get a Canon grip .  
2	  As a novice , I splurged on this camera and have no regrets . It is easy to use and I have gotten some beautiful shots . The portraits I have taken of my children are amazing . They look like they were taken by a professional , which I am definitely not . This camera is worth the price .  
1	  .. the X / R-axis potentiometers wear out ( after 1-3 weeks ) . I 'm done w / Logitech until they change back to non-mechanical pickups for the X / Y / R axis ( like the Interceptor . ) I 'd recommend the Logitech WingMan Extreme Digital 3D or ( if you can get your hands on one .. ) the Microsoft Force Feedback 2 ( red skin edition ) . Stay away from the Logitech Freedom 2.4 Joystick - same problem w / the pots ! ( .. )  
2	  I have had my XTI for over a year and still love the camera . The pictures are sharp and the color is great . Well worth the investment . I would have prefered a wide angle lens to the 18-55mm , but it is a good starter lens .  
1	  Well , my printer worked beautifully until I installed one of these cartridges . I had used the same ones before without any problems , but this time every print is defective , with a dash-dot pattern and smeared ink . there 's . Should have just ordered the cheap knock-off cartridges afterall .  
1	  The idea behind this product is great : create four USB ports in the place of a single port and make the package small enough to be inconspicuous and eminently portable . IOGEAR did a fine job with the latter ; this hub certainly is small and easy to carry about . Unfortunately , where the product falls short - way short , I 'm afraid - is in its dependability . It so happens I have four USB devices I 've tried to use with the Microhub : an external hard drive , a printer , a wireless mouse ( the receiver plugs into a USB port ) and an iPod . For each of these devices , the Microhub either caused the device to work improperly or flat out failed to recognize it . Using the mouse was an exercise in futility . The mouse tracked poorly and the Microhub would execute phantom click actions without me even touching a mouse button . That 's pretty frustrating when you 're trying to close a window and instead the document starts scolling down . As for the iPod , external hard drive and printer , they were as good as gone . Microhub didn't recognize a single one of these devices , causing me to ask " What 's the point ? " I 've got four devices and four USB hubs , and only one of them works ( and erratically at that ) . I 'm actually better off * without * the hub . At least that way I can use my mouse without wondering when it will decide on its own to open a context menu , slide down to the bottom of the screen or simply freeze in place . To add insult to injury , this so-called convenient piece of hardware heats up like an iron . When I 'm off to take my laptop with me somewhere , am I going to put this lava chip in my pocket ? Try again . The only reason I haven't thrown it out yet is because I 'm soaking it in a tub of ice water so it doesn't smolder in my trash basket . My suggestion is for you to save your pennies for something more useful like , say , a pair of sole-less shoes .  
2	  Good price and quick delivery . I have had no problems with this battery . It may not last as long as the Dell OEM but it certainly is close at less than half the price . I 'm satisfied .  
2	  This is my 3rd Domke Bag . Although I did not need this new F2 , I simple wanted it for the limitted color choice of grey . This bag is awesome ! Color is a combo of old skool n new skool . I can carry my 7d with 10-22 attached , 17-55f2.8 , 70-200L is ii F2.8 , 580ex ii , and lots of little gadgets . Very easy to get in-n-out of for quick working . I would not consider any other bag .  
1	  This keyboard came without a plastic plug . So , if you don't know how to reuse the old plug , you are out of luck ! Thankfully , with a little bit of tinkering , and a background in electronics , I could reuse the old plug .. but my wife surely couldn't do it . BEWARE !  
1	  I am underwhelmed . There is bass to this , yes . But that is not nearly all that is required for high quality sound . These are comparable to any other $ 19 set found at the local discount store . I can't explain all the raves - " the emperor has no clothes " maybe ? The marketing of these is very appealing , so maybe people are hearing what they expect to hear , rather than what they actually hear . If you are after a $ 20 set , that is what you will get with these . And I 'm not complaining-it would be crazy to complain that a set of headphones that cost $ 20 is only worth $ 20 . But I am not raving either .  
1	  Why would you buy this item in the store if it already comes in the value pack ? That does not make common sense . This card holds up to 8 songs and 4 games . That 's it ? The 512mb will go down to $ 70 by Christmas and the 1gb will go down to $ 100 . If you have a PSP and are a music , game , video , and photo lover , put a memory stick on your list to santa .  
2	  I like this camera . Relatively easy to operate and simple controls . Also extremely compact . One flaw-a very small memory card . Other than that I am very happy .  
2	  I bought this with the length adapter to use with my Korg metronome when playing drums . I needed something wider than a typical mp3 holder and this fits beautifully . Go ahead and order the lengthening strap if your concerned about the fit . I didn't even need mine so I 'll be using it as a cable tie ( one of many uses for it ) . I 've used it for two full practices and so far no constriction OR slipping issues . Awesome !  
2	  I bought it a week ago . Tried some shooting and transfered from HC36 tape to PC smoothly with firewire connection ( not USB ) and Windows Movie Maker / Sony Vegas 6.0 . The picture quality is good for resolution up to 720x480 ( high quality ) . Don't expect too much from this handycam , only the basic video shooting will do . If you want to make ' Hollywood-like ' movie , this is not the right choice . You need to have spare battery , the standard is about 80 minutes . One of the reason I chose Sony HC series is you can have an optional battery ( NPFP90 ) up to around 500 minutes . For me it is important as I don't want to carry a lot of spare batteries and keep changing batteries while travelling in remote area . For me it 's a good product for what I paid .  
1	  I just purchased one of this and realised that when it comes to photographs this printer does not live up to the job . You can see the white lines on the paper very clearly . I still prefer my HP .. For ordinery job .. this machone is okay .. but when comes to pictures .. it is a no no ..  
1	  Have had zero luck with two of these cables . If you try and remove them from a tight fitting connection , they will separate and the gold plug portion remains in the output , leaving you looking at multiple individual wires and a $ 70 cable that is now worthless .  
1	  This is a really poor design . I have to say that I reviewed the seller of this product and gave them a bad review for selling something that didn't work as advertised . They did call me and make some suggestions for how to make it work better , so my hat 's off for that extra effort . However , after spending 30 minutes with this thing , I 'd already thrown it in the trash as an unusable design . The suggestions the seller had may ( or may not ) have worked , but getting a battery charged shouldn't be rocket science .. First , it doesn't appear that the battery fits properly into the charger . I have an Olympus Stylus 720SW , LI-40b / LI-42b . I see this is a complaint of another user as well . Second , the design is absolutely crazy . The charger plugs directly into the wall , and the battery just rests in the cradle . On the wall , the cradle is upright , so the battery just falls out . Bad design , apparently not made for the battery I charge , went right into the trash . It 's cheap , but so what if it doesn't do the job I bought it to do ?  
2	  I love this bag , it is the perfect for the Nikon D40 with either the 18-55 or the 55-200mm lens . You can't fit both lens in it of course , that 's not what it 's for . I also have the Nikon strap attached do my D40 and it easily fits inside this topload zoom mini bag . I don't know what other people mean by this bag is too small , it 's the perfect size .  
1	  I bought this keyboard for my Tungsten T2 that I had at the time and no matter what I did , it never worked . I have never had this problem with a keyboard before and I was rather disappointed .  
1	  Mine did the same as all of the others , blue screen the works , less then a year after purchase . Under warranty the entire contents of the light engine have to be replaced . Now a year and a half later the exact same issue . I did purchase extended warranty so I didn't have to pay for the repair . So , here is the deal guys . If you buy this TV which by the way when working properly does have a nice picture better buy it form some place that offers an extended warranty like for 4 yrs and that includes a lemon policy . That way you end up with a new TV after they have fixed it 3 times .. BECAUSE they will . I want a different too what a piece of junk . The thing is it was just released before the technology was ready . So lets admit it and make it right ! I 'll at least respect you that way .  
1	  I know that everyone else seems to love this , so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general . My Ipod Mini ( pink ) is a lemon . The battery has never worked properly . It takes longer to charge than to discharge , and my current playing time per charge ( no changing settings , not backlighting , nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies ) is about 2 hours . Apple will gladly sell me a new ( $ 70 ) battery , but other than that tough . It is apparently my fault thet they 're selling shoddy products . I 'm not saying don't buy it . There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod , but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you . As for me , I think I 'm going to dig out my old discman .  
1	  I bought two of these fans from a major electronics / appliance retailer . I liked the look and I liked the features of this model . For months I was very pleased with these fans . Then after six months of faultless operation they both died within two weeks of each other . It was like they had a " death chip " in their controller or something . After reading the reports of similar sudden fan extinction from other owners of this fan I can say that I will never trust this manufacturer with my hard earned cash again .  
2	  It does what it 's supposed to do , store usb drives . Works as advertised . Great price for the item and it helped me corral in all those loose usb jump drives .  
2	  This is one of the best detectors on the market , and has saved me from many huge tickets ! I never go on long trips without it , and plan on using Bel for any future purchaces of radar detectors .  
1	  Don't order from 1800EMART . They will not send you what you order . They will send you a cheap generic charger that doesn't even look close to this one . When you contact them they just tell you to use it and let them know if it works . Well I better get paid to be a tester , not have to buy their product and risk my own to test it . The one star is for 1800EMART not the described product .  
2	  Perfect fit for the Canon G7 digital camera .. but then again .. it was created for it .. You should get one !  
2	  Cheap . Sounds good . Looks goog . Some rust showing after 1 year . No bigge . Be detailed and specific . What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product ? Not too short and not too long . Aim for between 75 and 300 words .  
2	  Unfortunately , the compant initially sent me the wrong product . I had to get ahold of them via email to let them know this . In respect to the company though , I must say that they took immediate action to send me the one that I really ordered , and they paid the shipping for it . I would have rather done business over the phone , but the company does not provide you with a customer service number nor a mailing address . This makes me wonder about the company itself . What are they hiding comes to mind immediately . No website either . Now , is it truly a universal mount ? No . If your Flat Panel TV does not have the VESA mounting patterns this mount will not work on it . Such is the case with my Toshiba Flat Panel . So this mount in its original form would not work either . But since I can weld , I made a mounting bracket ( Aluminium ) with a VESA pattern drilled into it that would fit the back of my TV . Then I mounted the universal moiunt to that . Added about an inch to the distance from the wall by doing this . But since I bought it to articulate the tv into a corner of the room , no big deal . The mount itself is well made and easy to install .  
2	  This is a great case for the S550 . Fits like a glove nice and snug so it doesn't flop around in there . The flap is magnetic which is really nice , many cases I have had in the past were snaps and they would eventually tear . The magnet is strong enough to keep it secure , but easy to open for quick access . The Nikon COOLPIX embossed metal name tag is a nice touch to the front . I purchased this for $ 3.49 with free shipping from Amazon seller , Photoworld ! They are great !  
1	  I actually " won " a similar version of this remote a couple of years ago at a Monster Training / Brainwashing . The Trainer claimed that the design was based on focus group testing , and they used Logitech 's Harmony software because Monster knew it was the best and they could not compete with it .. Seriously , he told us that . Physical Design Flaws : volume and channel buttons are horizontal , monsters claims this is because the on screen volume bar on most TV 's moves left to right . However , when someone wants the volume increased they would say " turn it up " not " move it to the right " . a knob would have made more sense . Another issue is the numeric buttons are all mashed together , I have slender fingers and still had a hard time pressing just one button at a time . One more thing is the square joystick in the center , which makes navigating menus a chore . Software Issues : I had a problem after about 2 months of use where the remote would say " usb connected " when it was not actually connected . When it is in this state you cannot use it at all . Then when I would try to connect it usb to my PC , the remote thought it was not connected and appeared to go back to it 's normal state . Then when I disconnected it from the usb cable it would say " usb connected " . It was basically an ugly paperweight at this point . I ended up throwing this remote away because I could not get a response back from Monster on the usb issue . IMO , Monster is a terrible company making over-priced products and taking advantage of consumers , and provudes terrible customer service ( if any ) . I am currently using the Harmony ONE remote and highly recommend it .  
2	  I purchased the Microsoft wireless 7000 keyboard and mouse and needed a switch that would support a wireless keyboard and mouse since my old switch did not . This switch worked perfect .  
2	  This apex is the most advanced DVD player around . If you want the most out of your money this is it . Be warned though it will take you more than a few day 's to set this player up becouse it is detailed down to the last sound decimal . I haven't figured it out totally yet , but the sound and picture just get better and better each time I figure something new out . This player can be completely reprogramed if your an expert at that . If you want to have total control of your sound and picture this one is the one to get , but if you just want to pop your dvd or cd in and play it this is not for you .  
2	  I bought this TV a little over a week ago and it was been great so far . The standard cable looks surprisingly well , as well as regular DVD 's which look amazing . I mainly purchased this for use with my Playstation 3 and it truly is a thing of beauty on this TV ! 1080p just blows me away , especially since I am pretty new to the whole HDTV scene . This is one of the best deals you will find out there for a 1080p television at this size and Sharp is one of the best LCD manufacturer 's out there ! Don't be afraid to pick this baby up . One issue I have been having is with the sound . The normal sound on the TV is pretty good , but I have not found a way to switch between Mono & Stereo sound . The TV seems to be default set at Mono , and while watching some cable shows , I see in the corner where it says what channel you are on , that it is switching between stereo and mono which is very annoying and there doesn't seem to be a way to change it . I tried all the settings and nothing worked so I dunno what the deal is . Anyway , if anyone knows a solution to this please let me know !  
2	  I got this tv just before christmas 2006 . I got it from circuit city for $ 1299 + tax ( after asking them to do a price match with fry 's ) . I also had a $ 100 cupon of circuit city so i ended up paying $ 1199 + tax = $ 1330 for this brand new TV . It is fantastic . Setup is very simple . Colors are very bright but one problem that i face is with dark scenes . Dark scenes look very dark on this tv . but besides that the tv is excellent . I had to get monster cable to make DVD signal look richer on the television . Two thumbs up for this tv .  
2	  Very sosphisticated audio system . This is beautiful visually and the sound is very bold . It sounds as if I bought a more expensive sound system . Wether rock , r & b , and jazz it has own flavor . I made the right choice .  
1	  Mine jams every once in while . Have reset it by powering it down ( unplugging everything ) . Pain .  
2	  I have nicer stands , but for lightweight portability and simplicity , this stand is worth its price . There are many options in this form factor , and I 've tried a few others . In a nutshell , this does what it 's supposed to , folds up small , is lightweight , and quite adaptable . It does have some shortcomings in the leg design by having only one pair of notches . iPads work great , but iPods , not so much . Yea , I know it was not designed for the ' pods , but still .. A word of warning . It is not the most stable thing in the world so don't trust your iPad to it on the edge of a table , or during mild turbulence during your flight . But for $ 12 you cannot go wrong .  
2	  I got these headphones at the advice of my mother , they 've got great sound but can tend to leak a little if you pump the volume way up . They 've got that nifty cord protector which is a great feature that not many headphones have . The only else I can say is that while they are pretty comfortable .. if your head / ears are not exactly the right size they can get tiresome and sore to wear for long periods . Great buy for the money !  
1	  I 've had this keyboard for about 2 years now . The first year of using this product was nice . Having an illuminated keyboard helps when programming or using the keyboard in a dimly lit room . Being able to change the color scheme is a nice bonus as well . During the first year of usage , I 'd have given this keyboard 5 stars ; however , after about a year , I noticed the " A " , " M " and Shift keys start to get a bit worn . Another few months , and the " A " has almost completely rubbed off , and now I just have a circle where the A used to be . After two years , the paint on the other keys are starting to rub off , including the " C " , " V " , " D " , " N " , and " M " keys . This is absolutely unacceptable for a $ 100 keyboard . I 'm not even a gamer . I 've had cheap $ 5 keyboards , where the lettering has lasted longer than this . Mechanically , the keyboard continues to work fine ; however , seeing the letters get rubbed off is an eyesore . For that reason , I have to subtract 3 stars .  
1	  Does not work at all for Window 7 , just like an earlier review stated ( currently using an Alienware M11x laptop ) I had an older laptop ( Lenovo Thinkpad ) running Windows XP , and for this computer , it would read CD 's about 20-30 % of the time . The rest of the CD 's , the Targus would make some initial noise , then stop . Tried unplugging and replugging the Targus with the same results . Often times , I 'd have to go to a computer at work to extract files off a CD , then load them onto a flash drive and use the flash drive to download files onto my computer , thanks to the Targus ' failure to read CD 's . If I was trying to download a program , then I 'd be out of luck . I can't think of any other piece of hardware that has been so agonizingly frustrating as this one .  
2	  I bought this drive to use as additional AV Storage . It has been working great as offline storage for my ReplayTV unit and also is fast enough to serve up videos directly to ReplayTV . In addition I use it for digital photos and music and have not had any problems with it . I did reformat the drive to NTFS prior to transfering the data and I am using the USB2 connection instead of the firewire but I like the fact that is has both connections available . Overall a great product for an external drive . But like all external drives data transfer speed is limited by the USB2 or firewire interface speed .  
1	  I have been trying to get ATI and Levono to fix a problem with the Thinkpad BIOS for 2 months . ATI has determined that the Thinkpad BIOS does not have enough " extra space " . DO NOT BUY this if you have a Thinkpad T60p ! From the ATI support : After further testing , it was determined that this issue is a result of a lock of option ROM apace that is reserved by the BIOS of the notebook and not a result of a problem in the video cards BIOS . The last conversation I had with IBM indicated that Levono needed to fix this ( SOMEDAY ) . I have spent about $ 4000 to get a system that will support 4 video units , and have yet to be able to achieve that goal .  
2	  Got this to work with a new interface to record at 24bit / 192KHZ . This is thick , well built , and bgrings crystal clear signal . Very good service from the seller . Highly Rated !  
2	  Being much less expensive than the Casio brand batteries , this is a useful backup ( the Casio battery lasts so long that one should rarely need a second ) . However , this battery is ever so slightly too large for the EX-Z750 ( I haven't handled the other models with which it is supposed to compatible ) , making it hard to remove without using the edge of a credit card to gain some grip on it . Even then it wasn't easy . ( The Casio battery just slides right out ; this one moves maybe a millimeter out of its housing ) . I returned my EX-Z750 due to defects ( see my review on the product page if you are considering this camera ) , so I cannot comment on the longevity of this battery . A brief outing with it ( one that did not remotely tax its capabilities ) revealed no problems .  
2	  I love this docking station . Would recommend it to anyone . It is easy to take with anywhere .  
2	  I purchased this item for my son ( in the US Navy ) as a Christmas gift . The service was super fast . He said the product was easy to connect to his TV and plays DVDs without any interruption . Thank you for having products that are of such high quality !  
2	  First of all , this bag is very easy to carry in any configuration - backpack , messenger , or top handle ( just across the office ) . I am about 6'3 " and a lot of bags are just not built for tall people . Everything about this bag is adjustable and would be comfortable for almost anyone . I love all the pockets , clasps , and storage options . Perhaps most important to me , the exterior zipper access for the laptop does two things - makes it much easier at the airport , and also centers the weight of the bag so that when you grasp by the top carry handle the bag is balanced and easy to carry . Great product for work or for school .  
2	  This was my first purchase from amazon . I could not be more pleased with the prompt shipment of my camera . This camera is amazing ! . It is definitely a great camera to capture action shots . I have never had a camera that could take clear pictures of moving objects . I LOVE this camera !  
1	  I have had this thing for a little over a year it has been subject to paper jams consistently during that time . I think the print quality is generally good , but having to open the thing up and pull the paper that has been pulled about an inch in after every page is frustrating in the extreme . Find an alternative  
2	  We have 8 tvs in the house , 6 without a cable box . Those 6 TVs showed a fuzzy picture . After installing this booster , which is very easy , the pictures have definitely improved . However , they are still a little pixely / broken up . 80 % better , but not as crisp and sharp as the 2 TVs with a cable box . No regrets though . It 's definitely an improvement and costs far less than paying for more cable boxes .  
1	  This was purchased by an elderly man who failed to check and see what operating system it would work with . Of course , he had just purchased a WINDOWS 7 . This will not work ! Further , I decided , in trying to help him , to call the tech support 800 number on the package to see if there was any way the product could be formated on WINDOWS 7 . The recorded message said , " I AM SORRY . TECH SUPPORT FOR THIS PRODUCT HAS STOPPED OPERATING " . My suggestion : Buy at your own risk . Luckily , it did not cost very much money .  
1	  Mine 's not even COLORED " gold " but at least it works and was cheaper than the 25 bucks everywhere else . Still , false advertising is a serious moral problem and i would NEVER order anything from this company again ! they know the product description is wrong , Amazon has been contacted , yet the ad remains the same . Pathetic !  
2	  I bought this camera two weeks ago , have taken about 100 pics , and my battery is still nearly fully charged . I thought I 'd have to buy another battery when I decided to buy this camera , but I 'm glad I held off , because it 's not necessary ( unless you 're going on a two-week excursion in the bush with no access to electricity .. ) No problems with red-eye , no blurry pictures when taken inside with low light , and outstanding battery life . I am getting more than I expected when I purchased this camera . I would recommend it ( and show it off ! ) to anyone .  
1	  I got this mp3 player as a birthday present and i was really excited because i had wanted one . The software had a lot of problems resulting in a lot of changes to my computer system . Some of the songs i had wouldn't load on to the mp3 player even though they were in mp3 format and the songs i could get to load would skip and were very bad quality . The power switch which controls on / off / hold functions fell out almost every time i used it , and if you have seen this mp3 player you know that the switch is pretty small . So after i took off the backpack and opened up the mp3 player i had to get out my tweezers and carefully place the switch plate back on to the actual switch that is about the size of a pinhead . Not Very fun since music is my life and i bring my mp3 or Cd player every where i go . So , if you are considering this mp3 player , DON'T BUY IT !  
2	  I was a bit skeptical about this product due to some early reviews that were negative , but I 've had a great experience . It offers a very rich set of functions , and has definitely reduced " suspicious activity " I had been experiencing with my prior router ( an old Linksys Etherfast DSL Router ) . I 've had to reset it only once in the three months I 've had it . I have not tried its VPN support . I 'm very pleased with this product .  
1	  i bought these speakers thinking they would be good .. no they were soo crapy i through them away . the speakers make a loud sound that ulmost makes you think they are blown .. but they just came out of the box .. dont waste your money  
2	  This product is perfect , exactly what I was looking for ! Yes , it 's a lot like a shoebox as a previous reviewer pointed out , but last I checked most shoeboxes aren't as aesthetically pleasing as these storage boxes , and they certainly don't match my home decor the way this does . Basically I was looking for an inexpensive yet durable product to store my DVD 's in that matched with the rest of the decor in my bedroom and that 's exactly what I got . Very pleased with this product ! And as for those who couldn't get there 's to snap together properly , I don't understand what the problem is , it was so easy to put together a toddler could have done it .  
2	  Can notice the differance going from Cat 5 to Cat 6 . Plugs in easy , no problems . Even works with wireless routers under them .  
2	  The booklet could provide more information re the various kinds of radar signals . But the bigger problem is that the radar detector won't stay on the suction cup hook attached to the windshield . It was constantly FLYING off .  
1	  I purchased 2 of these to put in two different Chevrolet trucks and it did not fit either one as stated it would . The antenna plug is different and will not work . Do a thorough check before ordering this product .  
2	  Update : just tried the Antec with my hot-running PS3 , and it helps it run cooler ! So now I own 2 of them .. + I took a long time investigating laptop cooler options , and the Antec works perfectly with my Dell Inspiron E1705 . Most coolers are made cheaply and don't fit a 17 " widescreen laptop very well . This one is well-constructed , runs quietly ( in low-speed mode ) and looks great under the laptop , on top of my desk . I imagine what others have stated is true : this unit works best with rear-facing internal laptop fan systems like the Inspiron 's . I know my system is running cooler because it was over-heating while running certain CPU-intensive software before , and now it isn't .  
1	  We opened this and went to use it and it would not work . We called Brother to troubleshoot and they said it was the Daisywheel and we needed to buy a new wheel and that it was not a part covered under the warranty even though the machine was brand new and this was first time use . I will be returning this and not buying anohter Brother product if this is the kind of support they offer on thier products . Horrible customer service when we called in the problem .  
1	  I purchased the keychain as a gift for my son-in-law . It was easy to set up and he was thrilled with it . It worked for one day ! It just stopped working - went dead . I tried charging it - but nothing . I returned it to Amazon ( no problems there ) . They quickly sent me another . I downloaded all my pics , tired turning it on - nothing . I charged it for an hour ( they say you need 1/2 hour ) . Still nothing . Returned it again . Amazon said the problem was too wide stread - they wouldn't send another . Just as well , I guess . Great idea , nice looking product . I really hope they fix the problem !  
2	  This is the best cd organizing system out there . It keeps my cds clean and being able to move them from my home rack to a portable case for the road makes them unbeatable . Now if i could only find some replacement sleeves ..  
1	  This is for one pair , although the in the product description it looks like it is for 50 pair . The spade connection is way too big to attach to home stereo equipment ( Dynaco ST70 in this case , which has pretty standard size speaker wire screw attachments ) . I 'd leave this one for the car audio folks .  
1	  The Item received in good working condition . But after 1 week the ink is printing a dark black streak every inch on each paper . I have to place another order now . Buy from a different vendor hopefully get a good product this time . what a waste of money .  
1	  The video as stated in other reviews is great . The best I have seen in KVMs . The fact that it is all USB is fantastic as well . The delay in detecting the keyboard is tolerable . The reason for the low rating for me is that there is no quick key combination that allows the user to change from one computer to another via a keyboard key stroke . What was Startech thinking making a KVM that doesn't allow the user to hit a key combination to change from one computer to another . I have never heard of that from any other KVM . That is so worthless to me . I have to add one more large object to my desktop so that I can switch between computers or I have to get up from my workstation and press the button to go from one machine to the next . That is the worst mistake I could ever imagine . Startech is lucky I work on a government site that took 3 months just to get all the red tape to order , ship , and recieve the switches I wanted or else I would send them back ! That is the lamest thing I have ever seen . If you don't mind button pushing then go ahead and buy this switch , otherwise you 'll be highly disappointed .  
1	  My biggest qualm is that since I upgraded the firmware to my DI-524 at the D-Link website , I have experienced random restarts from this router . Additionally , it requires a reset everytime you make a change to its configuration . This is extremely annoying , especially having had a router that never had to do that ( LinkSys WRT54G . ) I normally used this DI-524 in case I needed wireless from the LAN in a hotel . I had to pull this router out since I hosed my LinkSys from being too inquisitive with third party firmwares . D-Link has truly shown me how much I 'm missing from my LinkSys WRT54G and so with that , I 'm going to grab another LinkSys router . Some of you may not even care about the firmware factor , but if you do like to keep your routers up to date , and you 're an advanced user , please don't buy this . Save your money and get a LinkSys .  
1	  First , the good news : the Rio Cali has some excellent advantages over the other mp3 players I looked at . First , it 's the only one rugged enough for sports ( I take mine snowboarding and jogging ) , the yellow and black design intentionally recalling the old Sony Sportsman , I think . The arm band and belt clip give you a number of options for carrying it , and both work fine . Also , it 's tiny and light and slips easily into your pocket . The player is extremely easy to use with loads of great features . The simple joy stick ; the language options ; a fully adjustable graphic equalizer ( a must for me ) ; date , time , and radio options for Europe , Japan , and the US ( I travel to all 3 a lot ) . The radio is a big selling point , with 8 presets . One surprise feature I love is an " adjustable " key guard lock : you can lock the power button and joystick , but keep the volume free for adjusting . This is just great ! Add to that that the volume up / down buttons are different sizes and shape with a raised " plus " sign on the volume up , so you can feel which is which in your pocket . A lot of good thought went into the design . The screen is big and easy to see with lots of nice information , and there 're plenty of options for timing its illumination , and also a power-save auto-off feature . The biggest selling point is its expandability : you can slip up to a 512K SD memory card in there to make room for a couple hundred more songs . Never mind that the card will cost more than the player . The software it comes with is well organized , intuitive , and easy to use , or you can use Windows Media Player , take your pick . Now the bad news : first , file organization is a little poor . A folder system would be nice . Instead , you get play lists ( which , if you add a whole album to , the songs get alphabetized and thus out of order ) or bookmarks . Bookmarks would be great , except you can't name them . You have to remember what was bookmark 1 , 2 , etc . Perhaps they can fix this with a firmware update ( which is updatable from their website ) . Lastly , and most importantly is the sound : there was a lot of " operational noise " when a song was playing - this had nothing to do with the quality of the sound file , but came from the player . The sound was also a bit flat and tinny - very disappointing . I took it back to the store and exchanged it for a new one , but had the same problem as the first . The other features made it nice enough for me to keep , but especially on quiet songs , I was annoyed . Then I tried some higher quality headphones to check if that was the problem , and indeed it was - with better headphones , the sound was crystal clear , the tones rich , and the equalizer even more effective without any tinniness . SO . For the price it can't be beat , especially if you 're using it for sports as it was intended , or for travel . But to get it up to snuff with the more expensive players out there , you 're going to have to invest in better headphones for sure ( good quality , say 50 bucks minimum ) if you want to appreciate digital clarity in all its glory , and the SD card ( another 150 for 512K ) if you 're lazy about swapping out songs . With the upgrade , I 'm completely satisfied aside from the bookmarks / folder issue , which could conceivably be solved with software in the future . Still a delight to use straight out of the box if the little whine in the background on quiet songs doesn't bother you too much . Recommended . PS It 's been 4 months since I bought it , and I was wrong about the sound with new head phones : that back ground buzz is STILL there . Why has no one else complained about this ? The sound was there on BOTH players I bought . You can really hear it when you play an MP3 with the volume all the way down . The buzzing is LOUD . So , I take it all back . The features are great , but in the end , it 's the sound that counts .  
1	  I have had five i pods to date , 3 of which died ( hard drives ) and another that was given away . So i procured an Apple Care Protection Plan for my latest investment . At any rate it wasn't until about a year ago that i received my new " Classic " which had functioned well until one day when the screen went half black ( not dropped or cracked ) . I called into " Apple Care " and after roughly 10 minutes on hold I spoke to a rep . For the most part the claim notification went smoothly and after 2 days I received a package form FedEx for shipment . After a three day wait I found out that they had " DECLINED " my service / replacement under the pretense that it was " ABUSED OR ACCIDENTALLY DAMAGED " and the item was shipped back . Perhaps i misunderstood the value of the " plan " but after careful analyst i discovered that the plan does NOT cover ; " extreme environment ( temp . and humidity ) , physical / electrical stress , power surges , lightning , static electricity , fire , ACTS OF GOD ( ? ) , or other external causes . Because this is the case i now have a near-useless ipod with totally useless coverage . Its safe to say that i am justifiably aggravated and wish i could never purchase another product of apples ' again , unfortunately this is not the case .  
1	  This product works wonderful . I bought it for my epson printer and I have no problem with it .  
2	  Bought this cartridge to replace an old Shure R25 EDT which was sold by Radio Shack more than 30 + years ago . My old Pioneer PL-100 turntable which also became nonfunctional was replaced by a Pyle PLTT-B1 purchased several weeks ago from Amazon . I always wanted to go back to a cartridge with a more warmer and balanced sound . This Shure cartridge surely brings back memories of the older cartridge it now replaces . The Audio Technica cartridge that came with the Pyle turntable while adequate simply does not recreate music the way it should be heard . If you look at the Shure product line , you came see that they have been in business a really long time and know how to do things right . Actually , it is good to have different brands of cartridges since all vinyl records are not all sonically and structurally alike .  
1	  I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 17 " MACKBOOK PRO i7 MODEL . THE SIDE PORTS DIDN'T EVEN LINE UP , ALSO WHEN I DID GET IT ON , THE TOP HALF SNAPED OFF EACH TIME I CLOSED THE LID . THIS DID NOT FIT MY MACKBOOK PRO 17 " AT ALL.I RETURNED IT FOR A REFUND .  
1	  I left this adapter plugged in and it quit working after 9 months . I wouldn't spend the amount of money necessary for buying the Canon-brand adapter . In fact , I 'll be purchasing an adapter , from a different maker , that will work with my Elura 100 and only costs 30 USD .  
1	  Great GPS for the value . I loved the Navigation .. But the GPS holder broke in the first month .. The air suction does not hold the GPS to the wind shield or nor in the provided circular frame . I 'm trying to get the GPS / holder replaced .  
1	  When I received this unit it was improperly packaged in a cardboard box with no-zero-packaging material . The camcorder and the power module were bouncing around off of each other . Upon inspection and attempt to load a cassette cartridge I found that the switch to open the tape cassette holder was missing from the unit . Therefore the unit does not work . I contacted the shipper and was told by the company that I was a liar and that I was attempting to defraud them and they would not either replkace the unit nor refund my money . As a result of having been ripped off by this Amazon provider I will never again purchase any used items from Amazon .  
2	  Great price , excellent product , fast delivery . I would buy from this dealer again & again !  
2	  I recently purchased a Palm Vx , my first foray into handhelds . It was extremely easy to learn to use , and the software seems very logical .. so far there haven't been any " oh , I wish it would .. " and I have yet to consult the documentation , it 's so straight-forward . Best of all , it 's as though it was made for my Mac , instead of made for a PC and then translated . No more stray pieces of paper and thick datebooks for me . I also have 3 technical books loaded on it that I refer to several times each day at work .  
1	  Canon 250D 58mm Close-up Lens for A700 , A710IS , G1 , G2 , G3 , G5 , G6 & EOS SLR CamerasI was quite pleased to order this pack . Imagine my disappointment when I received it and found I couldn't use it without an accessory adapter . This fitting is not available for shipmwnt to Canada , so I am left with a package that cost me more than $ 140.00 that is useless to me . I feel that the vendor should have noted the delivery address and highlighted this problem . I would really like to be able to use these accessories that I received .  
1	  While there are many mouse designs that are specific to a right handed user , there is no indication in the marketing of this mouse that it was designed only for a right hand . Some websites for this product has the following line : " Recommendation : for all users " Not so , it is only for right handed users . For those that think this is no big deal , try using scissors designed for a left hand and try cutting something as simple as a piece of paper or a bag of potato chips . It is a big deal . Designing the product for a specific hand should be clearly noted ; certainly the photos could have indicated that design structure , yet , by my eye , it looks like it is ' a general two handed ' design . I would not have purchased this mouse if Macally had been more forthcoming in their marketing . Most mouse products that I reviewed stated clearly that is was right handed vs . an ambidextrous ( as most are , in my research ) design . I find the scroll wheel to be slow ( compared to , say , the Apple Mighty Mouse ) even when the setting is on ' one page ' which turned out to be faster that the ' faster ' setting . It is nice that there are two channels for the transmitter / receiver and it is a nice touch that an on / off switch is part of the design . It is nice that the receiver is also a battery charger . It would be nice if I could use it comfortably . My comments in no way reflect on distributors of this product ; they apply only to the manufacture Macally .  
1	  I am not pleased with this purchase . I needed a new battery for my cell phone . I did a search through Amazon and purchased the battery . This was a waste of money , as the battery will not hold a charge .  
1	  For the same reasons detailed by other reviewers here , Logitech 's webservers ( required to setup the remote - remote is completely useless otherwise ) were NOT able to handle the number of people who got this as a Xmas gift and their update site remained inaccessible to most people including myself . What was supposed to be a joyous gift to a loved one has turned into 2 days of frustration for both of us . We have tried almost hourly to setup the remote during normal waking hours ( west coast time ) without luck . Tonight ( early AM December 28th ) was the first time we finally were able to connect , albeit slowly . But the worst thing is that Logitech has produced NO apology to date ; emails to customer support go unanswered ( apparently tech support is on Xmas vacation ) and phonecalls to tech support result in getting passed from one person to the next , only to be told that ' the server is experiencing high volume ' . Frustrated users have had to turn to their website 's forums to express their concerns , with the faint hope that someone from Logitech might actually be listening . Incredulously , Logitech somehow manages to have enough support staff around to delete any negative postings on their webforum . Unhappy customers are notified that complaints are not permitted on their forum and are emailed that " The support nature of these forums makes them inappropriate for discussing Logitech 's policies or procedures ( including Product Exchange procedures ) , for discussing future products , or for filing complaints . " If only Logitech could afford to funnel some of that manpower into customer support - but no , that would make too much sense . This remote earned one star only because it has a potential to be a decent remote if it could work the day you buy it . But don't count on it if your plan is to make this ( or any other Logitech Harmony remote ) a Christmas gift .  
1	  Listen guys , these headphones look great and sound great , but they have a huge problem with durability . Many parts are made of plastic , and crack after about 3 or 4 months . Why then do you see all the big djs with these headphones you ask ? Well I will tell you - A. They can afford to replace them every three or 4 months when they crack , and B. Many of these top djs get their heaphones for free to influence the rest of us to purchase them . If you are going to spend this much money on headphones , I highly recommend the Technics RP DH1200 's . They sound great , look great , and dont crack after three months . I DJ for a living and I have used many different headphones and have seen all of them in action with other djs . If you are playing around at home from time to time djing , then these sony headphones are ok . But if you are a professional dj and play out several times a week , I highly suggest you stay away from these Sony headphones at all costs .  
2	  You can pay a lot more for earphones that don't give the clear sound and comfort that these do . They are much better than the earphones Apple provided with my IPod , and they are much better than the $ 250 noise cancelling earphones I bought . I liked them so much that when a puppy chewed them up , I bought a second set .  
1	  All you have to do is pay in full with a credit card that offer Purchase Protection which most Gold & Platinum cards doI was able to return a laptop with cracked case to AMEX about 13 months after I bought it and they gave me the full amount I paid for it  
1	  I ordered a Mini-iPod from Amazon back on April 30 , 2004 . The original ship date was June 1 , 2004 . Amazon has delayed shipping me the product 3 times now , and my latest scheduled ship date is September 2 , 2004 . My recommendation to you is go somewhere else to get the product !  
1	  This is a horrid battery . I charged it full , then put it in my D80 . It worked for about 20 shots , then it showed empty . I recharged it just to make sure it was actually full . I put it in the camera again and it again showed empty ! I would give it 0 stars if I could .  
2	  My Husband and I purchased the lens to go to Mexico and it worked wonderful . We ended up taking almost 1000 pictures and look forward to taking pictures of my son playing baseball .  
2	  I was a bit skeptical about this set of 5.1 speakers with so many 5-star reviews . I 've owned 5.1 Logitech speakers before . They were OK . They worked fine and did their job , but were just OK . I was looking at this X-540 system to replace those old 5.1 Logitechs which I accidentally broke . The price on these was good and I figured that they probably couldn't be worse than my previous ones , so I gave them a try . I 'm very impressed . VERY impressed . These are easily two or three times as good as my previous Logitechs . They actually have a slight amount of unmistakable fidelity in there . The woofer has been completely redesigned from the old model and has rather respectable , non-distorted bass . The satellites sound more clearly . The woofer and satellites integrate very well together and the 360 degree envelope is pretty convincing . For the money , I 'm very impressed and satisfied . These are a great deal and perform very well in a PC gaming rig , which is what I bought them for . These are obviously not going to best a real hi-fi system ( i.e. Conrad Johnson or McIntosh gear driving Dynaudio or Quad speakers ) for true musical fidelity . But these speakers really stand apart from the rest of your system and make you take note as they are just such a good performer . Well done , Logitech .  
1	  It 's a very fast drive ! , I bought it after investigating on the Internet about very big and fast drives . I reached to the conclusion that I should buy an IBM or WD ( performance in mind ) , so I went and buy the WD ( despite of what I read in some customer reviews from other places about the reliability of the drive ) ; I was amazed with the performance of it , but after I week of use it died ( and by it i mean that the drive didn't start any more , it just make very ugly noises ) ; all data on it was LOST ! So i sent it to WD and is has been 15 days and I 'm still waiting for the replacement . If I could go back in time I would buy an IBM  
1	  I knew the chance I was taking when I purchased this item . I knew people had experienced some problems with it but the majority of reviews were good . So I decided to give it a try . I should have known better . The first time I tried to take a shot the camera just died like the plug was pulled . I thought .. . " Huh , maybe my batteries were dead . . . " Then I remembered , " Noo . . just charged them ( they were both canon batteries ) . " It took me 5 minutes to get the camera to power back up with the grip on . So a little experimenting led me to discover that the battery compartment does not fit snugly into the holster and if it moves even a little bit the grip looses contact with it and the camera looses all power . Peace of c . .. So now I 'll have to pack back up the batteries it came with and pack back up the grip and somehow convince the company I bought it from to give me a refund . Considering how long it took for them to remember to send the grip out to me to begin with I 'm not expecting this to be a fast process . So for anyone who is considering this . . proceed with caution . And don't be surprised if you are the next review saying " I should have known better " . I 'll stick with Canon from now on . I WAS warned .  
2	  This is the best tiny radio I know of . I 've tried others that are built into headphones ( too heavy ! ) or strap onto the wrist ( sound & reception less good ) or that sell for cheap at the drugstore ( awful reception ) . From the suburbs it pulls in the NPR station just fine ( some small radios don't ) . I like that the tuner is analog , not digital . In my experience , the cheap digital tuners in other small radios cut in and out annoyingly on marginal stations . Sounds great with better headphones ( I use Grado SR80 ) . I lent it to my girlfriend and she kept saying , " It 's so cute ! "  
2	  I purchased the Nikon AS-15 for use with my Canon XSI digital camera . It has performed exactly the way I had expected . It gives you the choice of using your flash wherever you feel you want it to be .  
2	  This is perhap 's the easiest product to endorse highly that I have ever used . The simple reason is to say that few products have ever given me my money 's worth like this one has . I can't remember if it was 5 or six years ago I bought this box but I paid 50 % more than it is listed for here and still think I got a deal . I still use this box today ! Matter of fact I can safely say that I have used this to box to play cd 's and listen to the radio almost everyday during that time . To be honest I can't believe the thing is still going and strong too . When I say almost every day I mean 300 plus days a year too ! Not only that but the volume when playing cd 's is always at 9 or max . That is without the loudness feature on since that distorts at about 5-51/2 volume level . Average each time I turn this thing on is probably 35-40 minutes for radio or cd play . I ad that up and this box has cost me 1/4 of a penny per minute used or . 10 a day averaging 40 minutes a day when used . And it still is going ! No antenna now and a little beat cosmetically but still using it all the time . Still happy with the quality of sound . Mine has always been played indoors or in a vehicle . If it breaks I will buy it again if I can find it .  
1	  I had the 5K ( 5 MP ) model of this camera which was stolen . However , I have added three or four other digital zoom cameras to my collection which were better suited to my use since then , so when I got this I was disappointed . First , there is no external hotshoe for flash , the camera is small compared to the others I own . I simply found that I had outgrown this size camera . It simply pales in comparison with my Canon 5SIS and my Fuji Finepix S9000 , so I returned it immediately . A less advanced amateur might find it perfect for them , though .  
2	  This is a great way to add European Maps to your Nuvi . Simply insert the SD Media Card into the Card Slot on your Garmin and thats it . Does not tie up memory space on your Garmin . A great addition for anyone who will be going to Europe . Great program with fast and relGarmin n & uuml ; vi 260W 4.3-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigatoriable delivery . I would give this 5 Stars *  
1	  After only two months of use , one of the headphone wires pulled loose and now only works from one earphone .  
1	  The sound was tolerable when I first started using these , but it was very muddled . AFter a few days of use they began to make this horrible crackling noise . They only lasted 2 months before the cord gave out . I would recommend the Panasonic RP-HJE200 ( now called RP-HJE240 ) . They are well worth the money because , the treble is unmatched by any headphones i 've owned , and the bass is strong , nearly overwhelming if you have the EQ set right , but it is very precise . My second pick is the JVC Marshmallows , which are still very good but they don't match the Panasonics clarity and I don't think they are as visually appealing ( yeah .. superficial , I know ) . Spend 2-3 times the amount and get a good set that will actually last . In the end the Cobys will cost you more for a lesser product .  
2	  Not much to say , works perfectly . Also works for Pontiac G8 . Since this adds length , it could rattle against door , or hit window , recommend you attach to door with wire ties or Velcro .  
1	  I have had this Polk 505 Subwoofer less than two years . It has been returned twice because the amp . needed replaced . It has been about 6 months since the last repair and it has failed again . I never had the volume very loud or abused the sub . in any way that would have caused failure so many times . I have already spent enough on shipping to have purchased another one so I cannot recommend buying this product .  
1	  Easy , I have not received it yet . It comes via my forwarding agent in Miami , which sometimes take a bit of time .  
2	  It has a great price and killer shipping but the only problem I had was getting a grainy picture I 've check about everything that could be wrong but if you think u know what 's wrong please wright me back thanks  
2	  I 've had these Etymotic earphones for about a year now , and have loved them . But now , they 've suddenly become an incredibly hot commodity because they 're just about the only decent earphone I 've found that works with my iPhone . If you 're having trouble finding an earphone that works with your new iPhone , look no further . Clear , true sound - you won't believe how well you can hear with these if you 've been using a noise cancelling earphone - make sure you get a good seal with the ear tip - you really have to put it fairly deep into the ear , but you will be amazed by the experience .  
2	  For long trips you have to have one of these . Makes good sense to have a GPS with a lot of power all day long . Save on batteries . It wil lpayfor itself in no time at all .  
1	  For some unkown reason this Adata flash drive broke in 2 weeks on me . This thing is garbage , there a plenty of flash drives out there , I suggest you find a more durable one .  
2	  This antenna has given us , finally , static-free reception . Previously the signal ( from about 50 miles away ) was frequently plagued by static ; not with the TERK .  
2	  It 's an HDMI cable , exactly as stated , and it works . In other words , it is what it says it is , and does the job well . I 'm not enough of a techie to be able to report any more than that . I plugged it into my DVR , and the other end into my TV , and it works !  
1	  I 've had this darn thing for less than three months , and the latch broke yesterday . I 'm not hard on it at all ( in fact , it was simply sitting on a shelf for one whole month due to a break in classes ! ) . This is a worthless piece of junk . Don't waste your money .  
1	  The item arrived on time , the seller 's customer service was very nice but the item broken within 8 weeks . I called Panasonic and after four different phone transfers gotten handed up at the end , good thing it was only $ 3.99 . "  
1	  These earbuds had to be modified significantly to fit my Philips HN060 noise canceling ear buds . Modification aside , while the shape and size is similar to my original buds , the materials used are far inferior . These are stiffer and less comfortable , and seems to fit less snugly .  
2	  I 've had a HP 1200 Laser Jet printer for a number of years . I especially liked it because I could put twenty-five or more envelopes in the paper feed tray and print away . After fifty-five thousand printed sheets , I accidently put a clasped envelope in the printer with the clasp on the wrong side . This action caused the printer 's print roller to be damaged and from that point forward it put a unwanted mark on every page printed . In spite of this mistake , I liked the printer so much , I ordered a used printer of the same model from Amazon . com . That printer arrived with thirty thousand copies made . I am now on my way to infinity with the resolve to avoid clasped envelopes in the future .  
2	  As most of the other reviews state , this really is a 5 star keboard . I can find no fault with it other than it may possbily be TOO comfortable ! I purchased this keyboard for use at work as this is where 75 % of my computer usage occurs . It can take a little while to get used to if you 've never used an ergonomic keyboard in the past as the curvature and split key configuration is a bit different . Is just so happens that I 've actually been able to increase my typing and at the same time , keep my wrists and hands in a more natural position . Through dumb luck , I was able to get this keyboard for $ 22 from one of the independant sellers ( they changed the listing the day after I bought ) and I must say I would have paid $ 100 for this luxury .  
2	  It was shipped fast and the battery itself was just as described . I 'd buy from them again .  
2	  What to say about a flash drive ? I think the only think worth to say is that it works fine and I didn't have any issues with it . :)  
2	  I bought this adapter to add Quick Release capability to acheap Cannon monopodwith a built-in ball head that I got on sale a while back . I recently bought aBogen Manfrotto 055XPROB Tripodwith aManfrotto 488RC2 Ball Head . So I obviously wanted RC2 so I could keep the same plate on my camera and use either the tripod or monopod . This plate works really well for those needs . The plate is identical to the one that came with the 488RC2 , and features black rubber with ridges , not cork as is shown in the product image . The metal is also darker than what is shown in the product image . ( See customer images . ) I have attached and detached the plate several times - it secures well and the bottom of my camera shows no sign of scuffing or scratching . It fits on a 3/8 " screw but comes with an adapter for 1/4 " screws , so it screwed right onto the built-in head on my monopod . As is typical for Bogen Manfrotto QR systems , it includes a secondary security lock to prevent you from accidentally releasing the plate ( and camera ) without meaning to . The lock stops the quick release lever from opening fully .  
2	  I 've taken it on several climbing trips and traveled with it .. once you figure out the buttons its fantastic . I haven't had any issues anyone else is talking about ..  
1	  I 've used refractor scopes , spotting scopes , binoculars and camera lenses for many years . I know what optics should do and this scope is an example of everything it shouldn't do . If you are aware of what chromatic abberation , purple fringing is , then you have heard enough to go somewhere else . This scope has purple fringing on Everything ! Any edge will have it , trees , rocks , buildings , animals , birds , even grass ! It has to be the worst scope I have ever tried . Even the cheap $ 50 refractors have less fringing than this one and it 's not just high contrast areas , it happens in Shady areas too ! Absoultely not useable . Also the construction was poor . The two halves of the body are loose and rattle . If you tighten them , the adjustment ring for the focus binds and locks up . The front hood digs into the body when extended and overall fit & finish is less than expected . If you feel this is a good scope , then you must not know what a good scope is . Even the Barska & NcStar junk is a step above this one ! I can't afford a good scope any more , so I tried a cheap one . Now I just want to ship it back and forget the whole thing ..  
2	  I just got this item after reading just some of the confusing reviews and other positive ones . It was inexpensive and worth the buy . Upon getting it I unplugged by Logitech webcam and plugged in the targus . I then plugged in mouse , digi camer and webcam and it worked as smooth as silk . It is most recommended ! Works great !  
2	  I got this to replace my Hitachi 710 42 " projection set . I liked the 710 pretty well , but this 50 " Sony takes up the same space , looks better , has a much larger screen and notably better video with fewer artifacts . I took the bait on a refurbed unit for $ 999 ( $ 46 shipping ! ) through this site . Now that I have the Sony , I 'm very glad I made the switch . The Hitachi has better sound quality . While the 710 is the best sounding tv I 've ever heard , the Sony stills sounds quite good . The 710 also has PIP , which the Sony doesn't , but in all other regards the Sony is better . It is one of the best visually designed sets ; also the picture has deeper blacks , and render colors better , particularly greens , and has better fine detail . HDTV and dvd are fantastic , SD cable is still better than any other set I 've owned . My only complaint is that the audio out jacks are only live when the in-set speakers are turned off , which takes a multi step operation to implement . Not too user friendly and without reason , AFAIK . This sets the standard for a quality HDTV at a reasonable price . For those who 've waited for the price to come down on a great performing big screen HDTV , I 'd say the time is now , and this is the set to beat .  
1	  The keyboard worked fine for about a week and then in the middle of the day it quit working and I haven't been able to make it work since  
1	  My Jornada 547 pooped out in less than a day . It took the replacement over a month to become brainless . What a piece of trash . And returning it ? Forget it , HP and the store owner both wouldn't let me send it back for a refund the second time . However , all the peripheral equipment worked well . Too bad I can't use it .  
1	  Before you buy this delicious looking combo read reviews . Problems with keyboard connection and making connection if you are succesful will take between 30 to 60 min ( ! ) of your time on regular basis . Tried to set up USB bus so it is not disconnected by Windows ( to save energy ) helped nothing in resolving the connection issue . Tried probably everything . Nothing works to fix connectivity issue . Unless you uninstall ane reinstall software every single day . Simply stay away . Don't even bother .  
2	  I love it . I lost the original one I purchased from Best Buy at $ 59.00 . This was a great deal . Thanks Amazon .  
1	  The first one didn't work right out of the box . The 2nd one died after a year .  
2	  I bought this frame for a gift for my dad and had it delivered to me so I could load it up with photos . The power cord didn't work on the first frame I received and I had to send it back for a replacement . My gift was late since I had to return it for a replacement . The next frame I received worked fine . The frame is very nice looking compared to ones I have seen in the stores . The picture is super clear . Once I got a working power cord it was super easy to work with .  
2	  The online code is a fast and secure way to buy MS Points . I bought and after a few minutes i received a e-mail with the code , put it on the xbox . com website and the points are credited to my account .  
1	  as a performance artist interested in being able to create my own multi-media projects i enthusiastically bought this rubbish software . the installation seemed fine , but very soon after it crashed so often that i got to where i was saving my project after every change just so i wouldn't lose my work . the texts and fonts don't work , it jumps around trying to guess your intentions ( almost as badly as microsoft word 's auto-correct ) , it only burns to dvd about 1 time in 10 , and the rendering process can exceed 12 hours for only 25 minutes of material . expect to be on hold from 30-60 minutes for technical support ( not a toll-free number ) , and don't expect the menu options to be saved properly . the one time it created a dvd properly it was absolutely beautiful ; however , i worked much too hard to get so little out of the program . i also had to rebuild my entire system FOUR times after the computer stopped booting ( note : i have a 2.6 ghz processor , 512 meg ram , and 120 gig , with windows xp media edition - don't try to blame these problems on my system ! ) .. i 'm going to try the sony product : it averages about 4 stars from other users and costs the same or less .  
1	  CB does not work as described . Even bought the Cobra antenna ( 27 " ) still did not work . Returned within two weeks . Amazon did do a good job on taking back the product and crediting my credit card .  
1	  I purchased this router for a relative of mine . I recently opened the package to find that I received a USED router . There were scratches on the top of the router and the " install the software first warning sticker " that normally is covering the ports was off and stuck to the inside of the product literature . Someone also had scribbled on the product literature with a black permanent marker . I am not happy about this . I expect more from Amazon and Linksys . I 'm guessing I received a return , refurb , or something along those lines . A new item does not look like this . This is the second time in a few months this has happened to me with a purchase coming directly from Amazon . The first issue was with a computer subwoofer from Logitech that had a large scuff mark on the top of it . My guess is someone was resting their shoes on it . It is very noticeable .  
2	  I 've had this unit for almost 3 years now and it has given me GREAT service !  
2	  I bought this for my Sandisk MP3 and it is terrific . The sound is excellent . I do think I will buy the subwoofer . Music with a lot of bass can sound a bit tinny .  
2	  The Nikon remote shutter release is exactly what it ought to be . It allows me to take a picture without touching the camera - very long tripod exposures . It allows me to get in a group photo It 's fine . It 's a small thing needing to be kept track of and it doesn't actually go with my eyes .. But for this price , and considering there aren't competing brands or anything , I feel my camera kit MUST have this .  
2	  My purchasing decision for the Canon Powershot A85 was most unusual . As a defense contractor ( and ' part time ' professional photog ) and the owner of a Canon Digital Rebel - there are places and circumstances a large digital camera will cause unwanted and undue attention to be paid to one 's self . My solution was a compact backup camera - originally a Canon A75 - purchased for its price and ability to share compact flash memory cards with the Digital Rebel and AA Ni-Mh rechargable batteries with my Canon 420EX speedlight . Things got more complicated when I purchased a Canon underwater housing ( WP-DC30 - see my review ) specifically designed for the A75 while scuba diving in Aruba . Both the A75 and A85 are limited underwater performers - built in flash limits the depth acceptable pictures can be taken . Anything more than 25 ' - plan to spend time in photoshop ! While the A75 is a " good enough " camera at 3.2 MP , I was looking to upgrade to a better backup camera - still at a price point - and distrustful of any underwater housing - a replacement backup camera . Amazon had a great price on the A85 - and the underwater housing for the A75 is an exact match for the A85 . Enough said . The A85 is lighter and has faster shutter response than the A75 . The " feel " of this compact camera is " right " for my ( large ) hands . It takes astoundingly beautiful daylight pictures . Its 3x optical zoom is " good enough " for a majority of my picture taking - the 4 MP resolution allows additional enlargement and magnification with little loss of quality in Photoshop . Since many of my photo 's are e-mailed to my family to prove I 'm still alive when on assignment - large picture quality is less important - as most pictures are reduced in size for computer / internet transmission . Auto focus and auto exposure in low light is still slower than I want it to be . Faster than the A75 - but still has an annoying delay setting up flash and auto exposure in low light . As with the A75 , the movie mode is limited . No ability to zoom - and quality is only ' acceptable ' in this mode . Like to take movies ? .. - buy a camcorder ! Red-eye is still a problem carried over from the A75 . The flash / lens positioning allows only a narrow angle of red-eye free picture taking . You are going to have to purchase 2300ah NiMh rechargable batteries - or even two sets . I share 5 sets and three chargers ( might be overkill for some ) with my Canon 420EX and 580EX speedlights ( used with the Digital Rebel ) , the A75 and A85 cameras . High heat or extreme cold are battery power sappers . Never want to miss a picture opportunity . I also share a variety of 512MB to 1 GB compact flash high speed memory cards with the Digital Rebel . The A75 's plastic case easily scratches around the lens ring . I expect this with the A85 also . Buy a carry pouch that holds the camera firmly - and still has carrying capacity for a spare set of AA batteries . Dirt and dust have not been a problem - yet - although the camera case and lens mechanism need to be either vacuumed or airblown to keep sand and grit from interfering with the zoom mechanism . Sand and grit get into everything in many places I go . Under most circumstances - the A85 performs brilliantly . Under water ( limited by its ' flash ) - or above - anywhere a full sized camera presents a problem - the A85 gets the job done .  
2	  Arrived on time . Seems like the projector bulbs are what I ordered and they are in good condition . Excllant transaction . I won't know for sure until I actually use the bulbs .  
1	  I 'd like to share my Seagate experience with anyone who is remotely considering purchasing a Seagate drive . I purchased a 250GB drive , it failed within 9 months . The first RMA drive I received from Seagate ( $ 20 my cost for shipping ) was Dead on Arrival . The second RMA drive I received from Seagate ( $ 20 my cost for shipping ) was Dead on Arrival . The third RMA drive I received from Seagate ( $ 20 my cost for shipping ) was Dead on Arrival . After complaining all the way up the corporate chain via " Community Relations " I received another refurbished RMA drive of a larger capacity ( 320GB ) . It worked .. for a while . I use the drive to run monthly backups . It 's in a USB enclosure and the drive failed roughly the sixth time I turned it on . I 've begun the complaint process with Seagate yet again , although I doubt it will lead anywhere . I 've also filed a complaint with my states Attorney General . I work in I.T. and Seagate used to mean quality , but no longer is this true . I 've done some research at work and it seems Seagate drives fail at more than twice the frequency of their competitors . RMA drives from Seagate have even worse reliability . If your data is important to you DO NOT place it on a Seagate disk drive .  
1	  I bought one of these for my son and to date it has not worked at all . Keeps freezing up . Battery wont charge . Basically its a waste of money . I sent mine back for a refund and wentto Best Buy and bought a Dynex for 150 bucks , a little more than I wanted to spend but it worked right out of the box which right away was na improvement , plus my son can use it easily . Do not buy this item , it is only a headache  
2	  I didn't use this very long , but not because of it . The Ipod + Nike kit just isn't very accurate . This pouch on the other hand is good . It fits well and attaches to your shoe laces . Make sure to follow the instructions ( yes there are instructions ) on which way to put the pod in . Otherwise it won't calculate correctly , or at least as correctly beause it 's usually pretty far off anyway .  
1	  These filters are very poorly made . Out of the two that I ordered one needed to be re-soldered internally and the other disassembled and reassembled because the case improperly put together . I recommend going with the more expensive filters . Anything around ten bucks is usually pretty good . Dont try to save money by giving yourself this headache . It also did not help whatsoever with the noise on my CB from my trucks fuel pump .  
2	  I am a Professional Video editor with very demanding needs for my drives . After burning through two very dissapointing HP drives ; I decided to go with this one . Works Great . Haven't used the double layer feture . * This is the Worlds First 18x DVDRW Drive * Pros : I have burned around 100 dvd 's , never once had to clean the drive . Very fast burner , great quality and very reliable . Cons : The Software takes too much memory and processing power to run ( even while running in the background ) , for a DVD burner . I recommend to disable the " Boot-Up Start " and only use the software for limited amounts of time to keep your computer running up to speed . Overall , I would recommend this drive to almost anybody looking for a fast and reliable drive .  
2	  The Palm m100 is a great handheald . I would recommend it to anyone looking to buy something that can really help them keep organized . You can use it as an assignment book for school , and it is also great for games . There are thousands of games , free and purchasable , on the internet which you can download and install into the palm . Of course , it would be better if it had a little more memory , because with only 2mb , you cannot have all the programs you want installed at one time .  
1	  Microsoft Notebook Optical Mouse 4000-Dark Gray ( B2P-00006 ) - mouse . This is the worst wireless mouse I have ever used . Very cheaply made , poor design all around . Battery compartment is flimsy and very hard to close / keep closed . In attempting to retrieve the reciever I accidently ejected the entire thing . Magnifier button placing is awkward and too easily triggered with simple use . I immediately asked for a refund .  
2	  It can be used in both travel and car attachment . It is very useful . It has more compartment for storage .  
2	  This is a great looking and sounding unit . The design is simple but very effective . I like the little remote unit , too . I 'd give this system 4 or 4.5 stars . Why not 5 ? I 'm disappointed with the support for the iPod 's alarm and sleep functions . If you want to wake up to your iPod , you need to leave the speaker system ON for the night . It doesn't turn on automatically when the iPod wakes up , neither it turns itself off when the iPod shuts down in the " sleep " mode . When it 's on , the little display glows blue quite brightly , which could be a distraction . This might or might not be a problem for you , but I consider this a design flaw . Other than that , it 's a wonderful little speaker system .  
1	  I am giving this a two out of five because of the difficulty when trying to disconnect them from an audio source . I replaced my car stereo and I almost broke the rca 's on the back of the radio and did break one on the amp in my trunk . I got them off but one of the jacks broke , still usable though . Otherwise its okay product and be warned the cable is really thick ..  
2	  I just received my Nikon S9 a couple of days ago . I am def . not disappointed in it ( as of yet , that is ) . PROS : I like that the lens is NOT retractable ( it 's inside the camera ) . I 've read lots of reviews on all brands of cameras where reviewers complained that the lens gets stuck while sticking half-way out . This is something I don't have to worry about with the S9 . I also like that it 's durable . It 's not made of plastic , it 's very solid . I actually feel like I got what I paid for . Picture quality is good . You need to hold the camera VERY still while shooting , since pictures tend to blur easily . I 've been fooling around with it a lot , and I seem to be improving with my shots ( where blur is concerned ) . I also haven't experienced any red-eye ! Woohoo ! They red-eye reduction flash feature really works ( so far ) ! Pictures could be a little sharper , but the camera comes with a CD that allows you to edit the pictures on your computer , and change the brightness , sharpness , color , etc . , of the pictures , and you can also rotate them . This is a plus for me . The buttons are small , but there are very few of them , which makes it simple to use . CONS : Well , I gave this camera only 4 stars PRIMARILY because I bought it from Amazon for $ 249.99 , and then about a week later the price was down to $ 222.94 . I pre-ordered the camera . So 1 lesson I learned was : WAIT UNTIL THE CAMERA IS IN STOCK ( AND NOT ON PRE-ORDER ) . DON'T BUY A CAMERA WHEN IT IS FIRST RELEASED , WAIT A COUPLE OF WEEKS , CHANCES ARE THE PRICE WILL DROP . I 'M SO ANGRY ABOUT THIS ! Another con : You really need to play around with the camera if you want good pictures - especilly where lighting is concerned . It 's not a point-and-shoot camera - for me , at least . The settings are definitely there for a reason ( like the scenes , such as indoor , beach / snow , sunset , dusk / dawn , and so on . . . and the flash features as well ) . Haven't tried the video or voice recording yet , so I can't really comment on that . That 's about it . In all , I don't regret buying it . Only had it for a few days and I 'm liking it more and more ( I was a bit intimidated and frustrated in the beginning while trying to find settings that would help me take a good picture ) .  
1	  Same your money , this is a real piece of garbage . I 've seen some real junky electronics come out of China , but this is top grade trash . It appears to have cost five cents to manufacture and works like one cent worth of plastic . I can't believe that amazon . com has it listed on their web site .  
2	  My ipod fits nice and snug in the sleeve when I go on jogs . The plastic cover over the wheel and screen are still easy to use and see in this case . I have no complaints for this product .  
2	  I use this bag frequently , though it 's only big enough for one body and a couple of not-enormous lenses . Seems well made and I think it 'll last for many years . I bought its larger brother the 1600 to carry two bodies but that bag , quite unlike this one , is badly designed and I can't carry two bodies in it ( not with any lenses mounted ) . So , definitely buy the 1400 but steer clear of the 1600 , or at any rate be very sure it 's what you want .  
1	  Added to my setup so I could watch HD via my QAM tuner in addition to the cable box and cable modem . Was working fine , but one day , both our internet and OnDemand stopped working . We called support , they had no idea what was going on . We had to have a tech come out , climb the pole to turn our uplink back on , and provide a new splitter . This one was & # 34 ; putting noise back into the line & # 34 ; , and their policy is to have guys drive up and down the street , unhook any connections that are affecting the network , and then let the situation sort itself out . The tech noted that all of my cables were fine , it was just the splitter . I 'm not an expert , but this leads me to believe this is a terrible product . Don't buy for any sort of Cable setup .  
2	  The camera comes with a comprehensive and easy-to-follow instruction manual for people ( like me ) who don't have too much experience with a Canon SLR . It comes with its own battery charger , so there 's no need to buy another one unless you want to keep a spare someplace . The camera was a little heavier than I anticipated since I was used to the weight of the 35mm Rebel . From other reviews , I thought the camera would be quite small , however it 's a pretty good size . I do agree with others that the size is more suited for smaller hands . The shutter noise was also much louder than I expected , so I won't be taking any photos in quiet , public settings ( the reason I gave 4/5 stars ) . However , the quality of the photos you get is excellent . I chose to get the EF-S 17-85mm f / 4.5-5.6 IS USM and theEF 70-300mm f / 4.5-5.6 IS USM lenses . Both are great lenses for beginners without having to sacrifice picture quality . There are many examples of photos taken with those lenses from dpreview .  
1	  I order these for my wife . She wanted a headset for skype and some online courses . Easy to install , sound is loud and clear , excelent for chat and also it is confortable ( at least for 1 or 2 hours sessions ) . The only drawback goes for the drivers configuration . I order the USB version , so it has a sound card in it , which means I had to change between my computer sound card and the headset sound card every time I change from the headset to the speakers . UPDATED August , 13th ) Just to add some comments , its being almost 5 months since I bought it , as mentioned before , my wife is the one who uses it , mainly for online courses . The right earphone just stopped working this weekend . I checked the cable looking for some cut but nothing wrong , just notice that sometimes when pushing mute and another button togheter on the headset make the right side to work . So the piece is already malfunctional and probably will be dead in a few months . I 'm decreasing 2 stars because this phone didn't last a year .  
2	  This is the best remote ever made . It can learn any remote 's functions . All you have to do is make sure you buy the remote before your other other one is lost or broken . I combined 4 remotes into 1 on this and don't think I lost any features . The thing has a million buttons that you can assign to actions by just pressing a couple of buttons on each remote when it is the " learning " stage . Buy it ..  
1	  Hmm .. though the software loaded seamlessly , I can't get the mouse to work .. ! The instructions are simple enough-perhaps , too simple .. there is no trouble-shooting info so I suppose I 'll be sending the thing back-bummer ..  
2	  Never used this product before . Introduced by a relative and very pleased with the result . The sound was awesome .  
1	  We , as America 's consumers , have to stop rewarding unscrupulous megacorporations from creating oligopolies from slick advertising . Yes , the i-pod commercials and advertising are creative , impressive , and impossible to escape . The actual product is overpriced , unreliable , and overrated . I 've had to buy I-pods for nephews and nieces , in order to maintain favorite uncle status , but there are some consistent problems , shared by MP3 players costing a fraction of the I-Pod retail price ( I can compare because I get the cheaper ones for myself ) . These devices are fragile , their hard drives easily become damaged with routine use . Their batteries are characterized by planned obsolescence . For anyone who will use their i-pod daily , you won't be able to get a full two years use out of it before either the battery fails or the hard drive crashes . Apple has dismally poor customer service . If you don't believe me , go to their site , and try and find a customer service phone number . Google on a few I-Pod topics and you will find an expanse of sites dedicated to disgruntled I-Pod customers . You can get the same low quality with the cheapest line of MP3 players at a quarter of the price . Or , you can get either more memory , or better looks , or more convenient controls , or better durability ( you can't get it all in one package ) with a number of i-pod competitors , still at less cost .  
1	  I bought my A75 to replace my aging Espon PhotoPC650 , which has served me well for the last four years . The camera 's pretty good , but .. Six weeks later , halfway through our family vacation , the A75 died with the e18 error . I changed the CF card in our hotel room , turned it on to check how many photos were available , turned the camera off . Ten minutes later at the restaurant , the camera wouldn't turn on . E18 on the display . Returned from vacation , sent it back . First warning sign - be suspicious of any company that doesn't have a Return Number Policy . When I called the factory service center to check on my status five days after they received it ( according to FedEx ) , it wasn't checked in . I asked to speak to a supervisor , was told she was busy and would call me back . Three hours later , no call back , so I tried again . Not only was my unit not checked in yet , I was told that they had 24 hours to call me back . Now that they 've finally checked it in , it 's going to be up to 14 business days before they send it back to me . As someone who used to run a warranty service center for a national company , I find Canon 's repair and return policies disturbing , and their turn-around time laughable . Returns should be checked in same day they are received , customers should have their calls returned the same day , and barring unusual circumstances , no repair should be in house for more than 10 days . This was my first , and now probably my last Canon product .  
2	  The wireless keyboard is great . I have a Zire 72s . No problems installing or using . Very portable , easy to use , and durable . I am a writer and with Docs to Go it is much easy using this than trying to carry a laptop around . I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get more use out of their PDA . I don't know how it works with other models but there were no problems with mine . I highly recommend it .  
2	  This silicon case comes in colors and will change the look of your iPod nano . Blue , Clear , Green , Pink , and Purple . It gives color to your nano so that it won't be black or white anymore . You can dress them up based on your mood today with 5 different colors . It will also protect your iPod from scratches and prevents it from sliding on a tilted table or slipped out of your pocket when you 're sitting . The silicon case ' grip ' it well .  
1	  its just a plain usb cable , but not the Nikon UC-E4 USB Cableif i knew , i would have just gone to chinatown and bought it there for less , and would not have had to wait for delivery  
1	  Energizer should be ashamed to put their name on this useless piece of junk . I bought this laptop battery from Circuit City and 2 months later it could not hold a charge . When I attempted to contact Technuity or Batteries . com ( or whatever the fly-by-night company that produces this battery is called ) they informed me that I would have to ship the battery back to them in Indianapolis and include a check for $ 5.45 . When I questioned them about " FREE " replacement they just laughed . When I inquired about this business practice , they just told me to read the fine-print of the warranty . So , my recommendation is .. unless you enjoy damaging your laptop and spending money for a useless piece of plastic , stay away from this battery . Buy the Sony brand and pay the extra money .. atleast Sony will be more professional when responding to your concerns . Finally .. Note to Energizer - Cut these guys from your product line , you have already pushed me to only buy Duracell products from this day forward .  
1	  Since I have a lot of devices that use batteries ( X360 controller , remotes , clocks , camera , wireless keyboard / mouse , etc . ) , I decided that using rechargeable batteries would be best . I decided to invest some money in a couple of these batteries ( roughly 16 AA and 8 AA ) . Starting off with only 4 AA , it slowly amounted to what I have today . In a nutshell , I 've never been so disappointed in a set of batteries . I understand that you can't rely on cheap batteries , but I figured that I couldn't go wrong with sticking with the big names when it comes to dependability . This is where Energizer has completely convinced me otherwise . If you just picked up a set of these batteries , they 'll seem amazing for the first few usages . I have had some of these batteries for almost 2 years now , and they are all but dead . I 'm not talking about leaving them on the shelf , I 'm talking about dead right off the charger . I 'm using the LaCrosse BC-900 , so I know its not the charger . Prior to that I use to use one of Energizer 's $ 30 chargers , but switched because I thought that the charger was the only problem . I sure felt like an idiot a year ago when I was asked to be the photographer for a rehersal . For this , my camera was the Canon A620 which uses 4 AAs . I took what I thought were completely charged batteries and left for the event . About 3 hours later it was time to take a lot of photos . After about 20 shots the camera powered down , and everyone was staring at me . These pictures were taken using manual mode without any flash . Needless to say , I had to run to the gas station across the road to get some batteries . Now switch to a more recent event . Last week I took 4 batteries off the charger to use with my camera . The camera powered up then powered off . My other devices will run on them for awhile , but then they don't use that much energy . Needless to say , I don't even bother to replace my batteries with batteries that aren't coming right off the charger . A few weeks ago I purchased a set of 4 Duracell rechargeable batteries ( AA / HR6 / DX1500 NiMH / 1,2V / 2000 mAh ) . So far they 've been doing quite well , as well as the batteries that came with my charger . However , I 'll have to see if they stand the test of time . Afterall , that 's the whole purpose of using rechargeable batteries . I 'll also pickup a couple of Eneloops .  
1	  There are two issues with the SanDisk 256 that I purchased a few weeks ago . 1 . If eq is changed from " normal " setting the music slows down and is garbled . 2 . After my attempt to get customer service to respond via email , my experiece with calling the SanDisk Tech Support was also a failure . My recommendation would be to buy a mp3 player from a company that stands behind their products and appreciates their customers .  
2	  It 's hard to believe that you can purchase so much performance for less than $ 40 . This little radio has the ability to fill a large room with undistorted sound from any of its 12 bands . Moreover , it is quite easy to use . Sensitivity and voice clarity are remarkable . The automatic gain control deals nicely with weak and strong signals . Selectivity is quite good , but one could use a larger tuning knob ( or I suppose in my case , smaller fingers ) to make those fine adjustments easier . The size of the radio makes it easy to pack . Although you get a lot of radio for a few dollars , it would have been nice if Sangean had included an AC adaptor . I have used this radio a lot since I purchased it , and it does have a hardy appetite for batteries when played at high volume . Accordingly , I purchased an AC adaptor for it . I tried several adaptors before I settled on the Radio Shack 4.5 volt " International " model ( cat . no . 273-1759 ) . This device accepts almost any input voltage and frequency and produces a full amp of filtered , regulated DC . Unlike other adaptors I tried , this one is relatively " quiet . " It does not induce hum or electrical noise . Best of all , it folds up in a very small travel package . If you don't want to spend a lot of cash on a multi band radio , but want to be able to listen to stations wherever you may travel , the SG622 should work well for you .  
2	  I spent a lot of time researching all the possibilites before settling on the RS 130 . A good part of that time went to reading the reviews on Amazon . Background : my hearing , while OK , is certainly not perfect , so I wanted good quality , but top of the line would be wasted on me ; my primary desire was to get away from wires ( too much of a nuisance ) ; I mostly , but not entirely , listen to classical music ; I wanted something comfortable to wear over glass frames and that would not be too hot in the summer ( I live in Florida and my window faces south ) ; while I am not a typical audiophile , I am pretty knowledgeable about music so I wouldn't want anything that wasn't faithful to the composer . So far ( a few weeks now ) the RS 130 has met all my requirements . I haven't had any problem with losing a signal . I have found the volume control on the set to be quite convenient to use and not a problem at all , unlike some reviewers . I haven't heard any of the annoying noises mentioned by some , but that may just be a function of my own hearing ability . So far its been very comfortable , but I haven't tried it through a Florida summer yet . Unlike many reviewers , I actually like the surround sound ( yuk , some may be thinking ) . Some have complained about the blinking light - no problem for me - it 's not in my line of sight and I have so many other blinking lights on and around my computer that it just fades into the background in comparison . In addition to listening to radio ( public and SiriusXM ) and CDs , I 've also used it for Internet radio and TV with equally good results in all cases . Overall comment . I 'm happy I got it and can certainly recommend it to anyone who thinks he / she fits into my group .  
2	  I own three pressure cookers , I reach for this one the most . I use the bowl within the pot method to cook brown rice ( I am too lazy to clean , this allows storage of the rice directly into the fridge . ) After cooking brown rice in a pressure cooker , don't know how people have the time to wait around for a rice cooker . I like the audible rocking noise it makes , this way I know pressure is being maintained when I cook . I make mostly beans and brown rice , I cook for one and the bowl method allows me to have rice all week ( using the 4qt Presto ) I like this one best out of all three , because it seems not to clog like the others .  
1	  My S330 is sticking / stalling on the later chaptersof about every 5th rental dvd . The DVD 's do not appear scratched . The store then is able to play over the point where it stalls on my machine ( they have a different brand dvd player ) .  
2	  I 've used these on 2 plane trips with my ipod . Prior to that , I would just use the stock earbuds . What a difference ! The excellent noise reduction as well as the better-than-average sound made for a very enjoyable plane ride . Also , it takes one AA battery which is located in the headset itself instead of along the cord ( which would be very annoying to me ) . Yes , the sound isn't as impressive as my old Bose ( which broke after 2 years ) , but I 'll end with this : These Philips headphones with 80 % performance compared to Bose , but for about 15 % of the price .  
1	  I have had enough trouble with Linksys reliability in the past that I don't normally buy their products . However , the customer wanted a configuration that could only be satisfied by the WPS54G connected to the LAN through the Linksys WRE54G wireless range expander . The WPS54G needed to serve an HP multifunction USB printer , but could not do the job . The computers could see the WRE54G device ( although that device has less-than-acceptable setup problems of its own ) , and the WRE54G could see the WRT54G at the other end of their house , but there was just no getting the computers at either end of the house to be able to connect to this WPS54G device . Trying to troubleshoot the problem cost me far more money than this device is worth . So , what can we learn from this , boys and girls ? When it comes to LinkSys , don't just walk away : RUN !  
1	  I bought the Harmony 670 in late December . By mid January the display occasionally would freeze partially drawn , but we thought nothing of it since any function that could change the display still worked . Less than two weeks later the display stopped working altogether while all other functions still seemed fine . The batteries were still going strong , and the device had been handled well . Logitech tech support sent instructions to update the firmware but this did not help . They requested my contact information in that message , but my response-twice sent-received no reply [ Update : beyond the initial reply , Logitech 's responses were dated FIVE DAYS LATER ! ] . Since the device failed within Amazon 's return window , I 'm washing my hands of it . Overall , had the Harmony 670 continued to function properly , I would easily have rated it four stars .  
1	  I bought this item thinking that I could use the included battery . Unfortunately the battery only functions when connected to the adapter . What 's the point of that ?  
1	  The quality of the bag was good but the size was too small for our use with a DMC-FZ28 . We wanted a smaller bag but couldn't exclude the battery charger . This bag will only allow an extra battery and lens cover . If they would have provided a charger slot and a top strap the 1 star would become a 5 star . As it was it became a return item .  
2	  GREAT UNIT FULL OF FEATURES . BUY IT AND YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DECIDED ON THIS ONE .  
1	  I do not recommend this player . Within a couple months it broke to the point where it will not even recognize any DVDs that are put into the player . The warranty is awful considering I have to pay shipping both to and back from the company . At which point I would be paying as much money as I paid for the player itself . Basically it 's wasted money .  
1	  The random and incurable blue screen problems with this card are legendary . A quick Google search of " wpn311 " and " blue screen " will give any prospective buyer all the information he / she needs to look elsewhere . Whatever the ultimate cause , this card does not seem capable of working with Windows XP . Two years ago , I made the mistake of installing these cards in my office desktops . About 1000 blue screens later , I finally gave up and replaced them . I 've tried every software update , every firmware fix , and spent days with customer support to no avail . One thing that might be helpful to those struggling with this card is that the Windows software seems to work better than the Netgear abomination . ( including the latest update 2.0 ) My recommendation however would be to abandon this network card all together and get something else .  
1	  Will got the job done , in lieu of buying a much pricier , albiet more satisfying solution . Because all but the center 25 % of the image is blurred , this is more of an " effect " lens , than a true wide angle solution . Build seems solid enough . Lets talk about the packaging .. - The " pouch " that comes with lens positively REEKS of this horrible chemical / petrol smell . It got on my hands and it won't come off . It 's nauseating . - The box boasts the following " features " :* deluxe high definition * digital high definition wide angle lens * day or night video camera recordingCan anyone tell me what real world application these phrases have ? Do these words mean anything ? I 'll answer my own question : no . No , they don't . The words " Digital professional lens " also appear twice . This lens is neither digital nor would pros use it . This box has more meaningless drivel scrawled on it than a Bronners soap bottle . I 'd rather the box just said : " cheap wide angle effect gap-stop solution attachment " , because that 's what it is .  
1	  I 'm usually a big linksys supporter . This is an exception . This device is a joke . Not a very funny one . The first thing I was told when I called for support was it most likely wouldn't work with my printer ( Canon MP950 ) . I spent several hours trying to get a linksys router to see this thing with online support . Don't waste your time .  
2	  I am very very happy with the quality and service I received from Cameta Camera .  
1	  I am very disappointed with the product manufacturing quality as well as Apple 's customer service for iPOD MINI . I purchased the MINI less than 3 months ago . Whithin three months , the central area of the LCD blacked out . When product was returned to Apple for service , Apple insisted customer cracked the LCD , and refused to service the product that carries 1 year warranty . The unit wasn't ever dropped on the floor , or compressed in unusual manner , but Apple described the issue as " abusive use " . To me , it is a toal rip-off for a product short-lived within 3 months . An expensive product with sleek look , but poor manufacturing quality . Apple 's " customer relationship " department worths visting , when you want all the BS , and excuses to shut you off . I hope there is good product out there to replace it soon .  
2	  Bought this to hook my PC to the TV in the other room , and it works fine .  
1	  The memory button rubber cover fell off when I took it out the box and it took a couple of minutes to come alive . Sold it to a friend and got a Kenko . Looked really nice too .  
2	  My deskjet 960 crapped out after about 4 years , so I needed a new printer . Also , my current living situation is dual-platform - one Mac laptop ( me ; & I do graphic design ) , one PC laptop and one PC desktop - as well as wireless . We needed something that all three computers could work with / print to , and we were hoping to find a wireless printer as well . We were very pleased to find an HP that would fulfill all of those requirements . Set up was fairly easy - as long as you follow the directions ! You have to make sure you set up your wireless network to accept the printer , but again , fairly simple if you follow the directions . ( Don't jump ahead like I did ! ) It is very convenient to set the printer anywhere and just plug it into the wall without worrying about a router or plugging it into a computer . The print quality is very good for color images , even on plain white copy paper . ( I haven't tried printing on better stock , or photo paper , but I assume it would look even better . ) After about a week , I was ready to take the printer back . Some documents just wouldn't print at all and / or would get " stuck " , with all lights blinking on the printer ( typically when trying to print from my design software ) . Also , documents that were over two pages long would just print one page . I was convinced to call HP 's help desk before taking the printer back . David , the tech , was very helpful & knowledgeable about Macs , as well as about the printer ( and ink cartridges ) . To solve the " sticking " issue , go to the HP web site and download the latest driver ( as of today , version 2.7 - the CD that came with the printer had version 2.6 ) . The driver solved the wireless and connectivity issues , and I could print documents regardless of the program . It also seemed to speed up the output . To solve the issue of printing only one page of a multi-page document , go to Page Setup , and change Format for : Any Printer to DeskJet 6800 ; change Paper Size to Letter . In Microsoft Word , you have to change the document template to automatically change the Page Setup , otherwise you will have to manually change it before each document you print . To do that , go to Format > Document . Click the Page Setup Button , and change Format for : Any Printer to DeskJet 6800 ; change Paper Size to Letter . Once you have done that , hit the Default Button . When it asks if you want to change the default settings for the NORMAL template , click YES . ( I haven't figured out how to change this in my design programs , but luckily most of those documents are one page . ) For the money , this is a good printer . I hope it lasts as long as my old printer did ! Note : the reason I only gave this printer four stars is because I haven't had it long enough to know if it will remain consistent over a long period .  
1	  This thing is extremely unreliable . Mine is broken in less than 2 month ! Don't bother to thinking about it !  
1	  After unit broke , ceiva refused to honor ' life-time warranty ' and made us go through dozens of customer-support interactions repeating the same steps over and over at every call . Insisted we order parts , sent the parts , had no record of sending parts at next call and insisted we order parts again , then found record of part order and expressed being very angry with us that they had sent the wrong parts and required us to repeat the process . Continued to refuse to send replacement and said their warranty only meant they would try and repair the device if we mailed it back to them at our own expense . * serious time waster  
2	  The housing is great ! I 've used it quite a bit in the Bahamas . I just wish that the camera had more megapixels .  
2	  Its a wonderful product . Go for it . My laptop usually gets over heated in 2 to 3 hrs . Now it is running continuously for days without emitting heat .. Full satisfaction .. Awesome product . Go for it ..  
2	  I own a few different MP3 players and finally decide on the Zune because of the Microsoft name and the 30GB capacity , also because i have friends who swear by their Ipod 's but I found them lacking to some degree . The Zune music service is great , loading music is fast , and video playback is stellar . Overall in my opinion an excellent product .  
1	  NOTE : This is a review for the product , not the seller . I bought this product for my truck , plugged it in , got it working fine . Then after a long drive to Mammoth , I lost one channel , then lost the second .. then after some giggling around , verifying cables etc , I gave up . I tried to contact the manufacturer and they never responded . I wasted 60 bucks on this thing and the lack of customer service on this product scares me from buying another one again . I opened it up and the PCB looks fine . It 's pretty much a CAN bus interface and some solid state components went bad . Either the solid state stuff broke or the CAN bus controller spazzed out . I decided not to waste too much time on it and put it somewhere in my garage to get lost .  
1	  This unit has everything I was looking for : alarm clock , sleep mode , USB / SD reader , MP3 player . The sound is better than expected at this price and type of device . I purchased this item approx . one year ago . HOWEVER , the unit keeps locking up at random times for no apparent reason . I purchased this for my kid 's room and use it to play music all night . I did not have any problems with it at the beginning . After a few weeks of use , it started locking up but I could re-boot it and get back to business - annoying but could work around it . In later weeks , the frequency of the lock ups increased . I dealt with it as normal : shut off the main switch on the back of the unit , wait 20 - 30 seconds , then turn it back on and keep using it . Now , the unit locks up but turning it off and then on does not bring the unit back to life . I have to leave it off for some time , sometimes minutes , sometimes many hours before the unit is operational again . I looked in Coby 's website for a firmware update but none is available . It 's really unfortunate that this unit is not more dependable in operation because there was no similar product available back then . It has now become a frustrating experience to have to work around its lock-ups so often ( in a daily basis ) . Needless to say , I cannot recommend this product ..  
1	  Uhf channels come in fine but the Vhf channels don't  
2	  This is my third Brenthaven product ( I previously bought the nylon Edge I and Slim 14 shoulder bag ) . For me , the Edge I is the best balance between size and protection for a Macbook . It has much better impact protection than a neoprene sleeve , especially at the edges and corners , without the bulkiness of a full laptop case . The downside is , of course , that you can only carry the notebook without much else ( save for a few papers in the back pocket ) . Comparing the leather Edge I to the nylon Edge I , the advantage of the leather one is that it has a detachable external pouch for the AC adapter . I prefer the aesthetics of the nylon one and it feels a little more tightly constructed , due to the thinner cover material . The leather one appears more durable , however . Inside , the padding on both Edges allow for a snug fit - the nylon Edge has a nylon interior and the leather Edge has a faux-suede interior . Some people have complained about the location of the zipper and its proximity to the top of the case , which could lead to scratches . I never had this problem with my nylon Edge , but the leather Edge appears to address this issue as the zipper does not come close to touching the notebook . Despite the same measurements on both , the leather Edge is slightly bulkier than the nylon one . Overall , this is a good case for the Macbook if you want to carry just the computer , but want more protection than a neoprene sleeve .  
1	  Yo compre este mp3 hace dos meses trabajo bien un mes luego no funciono mas , lo envie a creative para revision y me toco pagar 140 dolares para por su arreglo , segun ellos el da & ntilde ; o fue mal manejo , muy mal producto  
2	  A great way to obtain excellent long-scale 16 bit digital copies from 35mm film and slides . With a high-end camera like the Nikon D800 or equivalent and a good macro lens , the quality is better than one would get with many film scanners .  
2	  This is my first prime lens , and my second lens purchase , and it was exactly what I was looking for . If you 're just starting out in photography and haven't shot with a prime before , it 's an experience I 'd recommend ( removing the zoom forces you to think about where you 're standing and makes me more inclined to fiddle with other features which have a larger impact in the resulting photos ) . The low f-stop is absolutely fantastic for shooting photos in real world indoor lighting situations . The only negative thing I have to say about this lens is that it has no IS , but that seems to be the norm for < 300 mm prime lenses .. the lack of IS causes me a bit of a headache when I 'm trying to shoot in low light without a tripod and want to ensure I 've got my subject in sharp focus .  
2	  I bought this item after returning the Panasonic RX-D29 CD / Radio / Cassette Boombox with MP3 CD Playback ( see my review ) . This box IS different in that it doesn't have MP3 playback . Other than that missing feature , this Sony is a far superior machine . The sound , especially with both the Mega Xpand and the Mega Bass turned on , is wonderful . The physical design is lovely . The buttons ( on the box and on the remote ) are much more user-friendly and intuitive than on the Panasonic . Also much larger . So far , I only have one small complaint ( my only reason for not giving a rating of 5 stars ) : the rather tiny display doesn't have a back-light . It is positioned in the middle of the front , rather than higher up , so if you have the box placed on a table , you have to kneel down and get pretty close to read the display . The ring of pretty , neon-blue lighting behind the display actually makes it harder to see the display because the display appears darker in contrast . This is unfortunate because the display provides much useful information , and I 'd like to be able to see it better . In summary , this box has one design flaw and many wonderful audio and cosmetic features . An extremely good value .  
1	  Purchased this item last November and have yet to get a decent scan with it . While it is small and light it suffers from an inability to control the scan . Along with that limitation is the fact that no matter how good you are at moving the scanner down the page the output is distorted in practically every case . Also , the software hoops necessary through which one must jump in order to get a workable product is daunting . The idea is great , but the product thus far is not ready for prime time .  
1	  Don't buy these adapters . The plastic body is made of a very brittle plastic that breaks easily . I bought 12 for a project I was doing and about half of them are broken . Spend a little more to get all metal adapters .  
2	  This is my second d link and works great . Tried a different brand through Amazon and took it back within a week and went back to D link just upgraded to this router love it best in towm  
2	  I work at home as the Team Lead for a group of software developers located in various locations around the country and the world , so I spend a lot of time on the phone . I had a very similar headset that I used for several years but it finally wore out so I went shopping for a new one . After looking at the choices and prices , I opted for this headset . This is not a fancy headset - no volume controls or other bells or whistles . Just a basic headset with one cushioned earpad , an adjustable piece that wraps around your head , and a clip to hold the wire in place on your shirt if you want to do that . The volume is fine , nobody has a problem hearing me , there is no static . Based on the history of my last one I expect this will last for several years - or at least until the vinyl starts flaking off the earpad . That 's what happened to my old one , and even though I got a cover for it the cover got stretched out and wouldn't stay on . Heck , at this price I could replace it every year and still be ahead of the game over fancy , more expensive , headsets . If you just want a headset for your desk phone ( not cellphone ) and don't care about bells and whistles , this is the one for you . Note that this will probably not fit a cellphone but it works great with my Panasonic cordless phone .  
1	  Put simply this product does not work . I have barely 200 pages of print off of this model before it simply failed to feed paper . Investigating the issue the rubber roller that feeds the paper is all dried out and cracking . The printer is basically new and parts are already faulty on the item . It is a piece of JUNK . Samsung I thought was a reliable mfgr . They have ruined their reputation with this product . The only thing to turn my opinion around with Samsung is if they replace this item free of charge with printer that works past 200 copies .  
1	  I bought this product after months of careful consideration . I spent $ 149 ( plus $ 25 for the USB cord that doesn't com in the box . ) , and got a piece of junk ! The scanner went out after less then a year of very light use . I spent all day on the phone with " tech support " and they finally determined that they needed to send a replacement . Guess what ! ? They did send a replacement . A REFURBISHED replacement for my NEW product , and it was like pulling teeth to get them to do that ! Well surprise , surprise less then a year later the refurbished is now not working either . Every time you print a page it holds on to it and the cartridge cradle bangs back and forth , and shoots error messages out ! Therefore I can't align new cartridges because you have to print a page to do that , and after you clear up all the error messages it cancels the alignment . So I get a lot of ruckus for printing a page and it 's not aligned so the printing job sucks . I 'm sorry to say this piece of junk is not cutting it , and I don't know what to buy next .. You 'd think 2 months of careful consideration , reading reviews , and talking to actual users would help you make a decision , but this is what I got for doing that . STAY AWAY from HP . Their customer service is NOT !  
2	  I decided to upgrade my existing hub to a router so that I could take full advantage of my cable service and get the firewall protection that I needed . However , I didn't want to fall into technical hell while installing it . The Siemens router solved my problem with only one minor issue which was solved late on a Sunday afternoon by their wonderful support staff . The browser-based utility and the instructions had me up and running in less than 15 minutes . The only thing that kept me from giving this a 5 star rating was that fact that the WAN and Printer connections are on the back and the LAN connections and lights are on the front . It seemed to be an unusual design .  
2	  The picture quality is great . I 'm not sure if it is designed that way but it makes a clunking sound when ejecting the disc .  
1	  I bought this camera after reading positive reviews on amazon and the web . Don't believe the reviews . The camera is on its way back to amazon as I type this . It is not worth the money . The pictures come out good if you can hold the camera still long enough for the camera to take the picture . You push the shutter release and have to wait 2-3 seconds before you can move . Also , the lens is not " true . " You have to be pointing the camera perfectly at what you want to get what you think you are getting . No room for error .  
1	  I am a student and this router would not connect with the University Network . After several tries we gave up and sent it back . I am not very technologically savvy , though , so perhaps you will be able to make it work .  
2	  I did a lot of looking around before I bought this printer . I needed the top feed for all the different kinds of printing I do and we were also needing a scanner . The printer is really fast and the scanner works perfectly and easily . I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase . It even fits nicely on my desktop .  
1	  I had this for about a year and the cd player stoped working . If you want one with a cd player I 'd recomend buying one with a flat cd holder not vertical . The radio also dosen't get a good signal  
2	  I have used 3 web cams , but this unit gives the clearest and sharpest video quality . The audio provided by this cam is clean , too . It works only with Windows , no driver for Linux . Check its dimensions before you buy so you won't be surprised . I think it 's big to be used with a laptop . If you want the best picture and sound quality and don't care much about the size , then this is a good choice .  
2	  My brother was looking for a cheap HDMI cable and I got him this . He uses it on his PS3 and he likes it , then again 1 HDMI cable is basically the same as any other as long as you get a decent build quality and it 's HDMI 1.3 .  
2	  Excellent audio quality for radio or iPod ; controls logical and accessible . It 's a larger-than-usual " clock " radio , so be sure your nightstand is large enough if it 's for a bedroom . Variable display screen lighting is a nice touch ; remote is great , especially for a setting where you are also taking phone calls or otherwise interrupted . I got the black model , which is sleek and attractive .  
2	  I upgraded from the 2620 to the 2720 because this one actually speaks with the names of the streets or freeway so you don't have to look at the screen while you are driving . Very user friendly !  
2	  The day after I bought my Tivoli Stereo system I bought one of these . I wondered if I really needed it , because my taste in music doesn't run to window-shaking bass-heavy music . However , once I compared the sound between the regular stereo and the stereo with the sub-woofer , I was converted . This sub-woofer adds a depth and warmth to the music that enhances even down-tempo tracks . Almost any system can blast out sound , but a good system is one that lets you feel the music even when the volume is turned down . To make the package even sweeter , there is the elegantly simple design . The lack of pointless , cumbersome buttons and sliders is a breath of fresh air . The real wood combined with taupe metal of the system feels both mature and masculine , unlike most stereos which appear to draw their design inspirations from the grills of monster trucks .  
1	  ! STAY AWAY ! This will be my absolute last item I purchase from MONSTER for myself , for others as gifts and for any company I ever work for . I have purchsed lots of products from monster over the years including overpriced speaker wire , surge protectors and audio / video cables . I originally purchased the HTS 5100 Power Center around 2-3 years ago and all of a sudden one night it " popped " and never came back on . This seems to be a common issue after reading other reviews on this product on Amazon and other electronic retailers sites . There was no power surge to the house or the this unit . I have other protectors that did not read any jolt in other outlets and nothing turned off / on in the house howeve the Monster HTS 5100 just died . This item is just not built to last , however it is priced like it should . I use less expensive Belkin and GE surge protectors / line conditioners for years also and never had a problem with any of them or the equipment plugged into them EVER ! I have only had problems with overpriced underperforming Monster equipment . You lost a customer Monster . No more Monster anything for me . YOUR FIRED MONSTER !  
2	  The product I received was exactly what I thought I was getting . I paid much less for the DVD 's then I would have if I had bought them in a store . I would definetly buy them from Amazon again .  
1	  I 'm a working journaliust-24 boo0ks and myriad magazine articles . I needed a tape recorder = to tape telephone conversations . This one taped nothing . NOTHING . It was totally broken . I sent it back to the sender ( at a cost of 7 bucks postage , but I couldn ' ; t stand the arrogance that jogged someone to send a broken product ! ) Sherry Suib Cohen  
1	  it comes with 2 rech batt . only . 60 min chargr is for charging one single low capacity battery . very disappointed :(  
1	  This hub worked fine and was easy to set up . Some how after about a month it quit working at all . Anything connected to it would not function . The only things I had attached to it was two Printers and a 2gb thumb drive . I just installed the replacement hub ( different brand ) so we will see if this goes south after about a month .  
2	  I bought this extra memory as the Nikon Coolpix S10 camera comes with 1GB card . For videos and photos this 1GB is too little .  
2	  I 'm really impressed with the Sansa . It 's tiny , solidly built , and has some great features that competing products don't . It plays videos , has great sound quality , has expandable memory , has an FM Tuner , and has a built in mic for recording audio . The interface is easy to use and the controls are simple . The scroll wheel works well but the movement could be just a little bit smoother . Overall I would definitely recommend this player to anyone looking for a small , easily portable flash-based audio player .  
1	  This set of headphones has great sound quality , however , it 's only marginally better on paper than its Sony counterpart . Because it has problems with a very brittle headband , and will very quickly crack and break away entirely into sharp pieces of hard plastic , I cannot recommend these headphones except for review for product safety . Every time I have to send away my pair to get repaired I have to pay for shipping to Sennheiser , and I am without the headphones for weeks as a result . Save yourself a headache and possibly further physical injury and consider getting the Sony headphones ..  
2	  The Hoya filter was ordered along with a Nikon D60 as protection for the 18-55 kit lens . It appears to be perfectly clear with a precision fit .  
2	  I love my mp3 player . I put pictures on it , I listen to music and I even record my own voice to remind my self of little things . This is a wonderful product to buy .  
1	  This switch is as plain and simple as it can be - just a cheap metal casing with a crude switch and the wires going to the ports . As small as it already is , it could have been made into something even less than half the size . 90 % of the space in the case is air .  
1	  This was a great camera until it was out of warranty . Then at the most inopportune times " Card Cover Not Closed " would appear on the LCD screen preventing any further picture taking . I tried all types of tricks like removing the card and putting it back in until the message disappeared . Eventually , my frustration sent me to the Eastern USA Olympus headquarters at Hauppauge , NY for service . Well , the flat rate was $ 80 . I decided that it wasn't worth spending this much for a 4MP camera when for just a few more dollars I could get another camera with better features . Too bad I hadn't checked the Web before buying this camera as this card cover problem seems prevalent in any discussion I found concerning Olympus .  
2	  Met every expectation . Easy to install & very affordable . Recieved much sooner than expected . Were told 7-10 days but only took 4 . Very pleased with the buy .  
1	  very pool quality . actually i want to return this product . i dont know how to do that . This is worst product from sony . I never expected this from sony . I spent around $ 80 + for this product . that is my hard earn money .  
2	  Well I got this because I wanted to keep my stock headunit . I installed my line out converter to my speaker on my back top deck of my car . I stiripped the wires and krimped them together with the line out converter so it is a secure connection and I lugged the RCA 's to the other side of the converter to my amp . Worked very well . Subs sound amazing and my stock headunit looks a lot better then an aftermarket . 5 star product . Great buy . Very easy installment  
2	  This is my second identical headset . I use one in my home office 1-4 hrs a day and the first headset lasted about 4-5 years . For a $ 10 headset I think that 's outstanding . It has no volume control but my phone does so it is not an issue .  
2	  What a great camera in such a small package . I do recommend to use with 400 film , I just have not felt comfortable using 800 film on it .  
1	  I 've owned Sony Walkman CD players in the past that were really good and performed well in my car . When my last unit started to have some problems , I immediate bought another Sony , assuming equally good functionality . NOT . This unit has no backlight - try to change tracks in the dark car . The BIGGEST problem for me is that there is no " resume " function as in past units and no way to retain settings . When you disconnect the power source ( as in shutting off the car ) you lose volume settings and track settings so the unit always goes back to track 1 as opposed to resuming where you left off . There 's an annoying beep if you change from one track to another also . You can turn that off but then when you shut your car off , the setting is lost and you have to reset the " beep off " setting . Lastly , the unit is hard to open . Not a problem if you 're using it on a walk but a big problem if you 're trying to change CDs at a stop light in your car or trying to do it in the dark . While the anti-skip protection is great and the sound is reasonably good , there just have to be better buys out there .  
1	  These & # 34 ; cooling & # 34 ; pads are nothing more than a piece of foam . They barely hold the computer upright enough for adequate ventilation . I would save your money and buy something that 's better .  
1	  Acutally when it operated it was good but the way you had to plug it in was very cheap and sure to break which it did . I notified the company of it breaking and since it 's no longer made I was given a refund .. that was awesome !  
1	  Purchased this MP3 player in April 2005 . Worked great for twelve months - then I had a problem - it was stuck in FM mode , and I could not turn it off ( unless I pulled out the batteries each time ) . Went to the Creative Labs web site for support - nothing there to help my situation - then I sent an email - and they told me that they WOULD NOT ASSIST ME , and then refered me back to the web site . They also gave me a phone number to call - but that IT WOULD COST ME [ .. ] EVERY 30 MINUTES OF " SUPPORT " THAT THEY PROVIDE ! So now my MP3 player is no longer functional , and I need to buy a new one . If you value customer service - STAY AWAY FROM CREATIVE LAB PRODUCTS  
1	  I bought this printer cartridge hoping to avoid lower performance from the very cheap priced online products , yet be able to get a cartridge lower in price than Epson . I just bought the cartridge several days ago and followed the directions which suggested using the nozzle check ( check for clean nozzles ) . Upon first use there was gaps / lines in the text . The ink also blurred quite often . I attempted to clean the nozzles through my printer and they seemed to improve slightly . Slightly is not good enough though as the printing still smudged and left lines even after at least seven cleanings . Overall , this product has the performance generally lower or at least equal to the cheap unknown cartridges . Save yourself the hassle and avoid this swing and miss .  
1	  I have used various brands of DVD media without a problem until I bought a 50-pack TDK DVD spindle . My DVD recorder is unable to record on TDK and rejects all my attempts . I pop in a Sony disc and it works perfectly . The TDK company isn't very responsive either , TDK 16X DVD + R 50 Pack Spindlesuggesting only that I ship the discs to them at my expense for their examination . Do not buy this product .  
1	  Although my printer hasn't yet died completely , there is clearly a problem with the chip that reads ink levels . I use a printer very little , yet every time I turn on the computer , my ink level reads lower . When I remove the cartridges , there is clearly plenty of ink left , as evidenced by the " sloshing " sound . Believing it has no ink , however , the printer will not print . I also have a horrible time with the defaults . It constantly resets to 4x6 as the default paper size , and full color printing . Just try telling it otherwise ! What a nightmare . This printer is not worth any price . I haven't decided yet whether to send it to Goodwill , or the dumpster .  
1	  I purchased this portable DVD player for our RV . We went on 2 trips and played a total of 10 movies when it no longer would work . The screen turned completely white . The DVD player was 94 days old after we returned from our 2nd trip . 4 days out of warranty - Polaroid said it was not fixable and the best they would offer is a replacement unit - for $ 50.00 ! It 's only an $ 80 DVD player , why would I pay $ 50.00 when the 1st one only lasted 10 DVD 's . Very unhappy with Polaroid , will never buy another one of their products !  
1	  Allow me to save you some time by simply saying that I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers about the poor navigation and control with this hardware . This is the piece of information I would like to add : I used this device for almost six months before it quit on me completely . It won't even turn on anymore ; it just stays at the title screen and does not load the music . I know this could have been a very isolated incident , but a friend of mine also bought this same product , and has experienced the same outcome . Please , save yourself some time and money when it comes to the Zen Neeon , and pass it by .  
1	  I received a Kodak EasyShare C613 digital camera for an early Christmas gift . I called Kodak for instructions to connect the camera to my TV / DVR so I could use it like my previous Canon style camera . I was told that the " dock " would solve that problem . The camera connects to the dock , but THIS camera does NOT have the AV capabilities . Therefore , I need to send the dock back to Amazon for a refund .  
2	  The brand and fit that came up for my make and model . No issues , just great product performance . Highly recommended .  
1	  I bought these headphones because I was tired of my cheap headphones always dying on me . But 5 months into having these headphones the sound is already distorted and muffled . My I-pod buds sound better . I 've spend 2 hours already chatting with a Sony tech online to see if the manufacturer warranty could help me at all but I got nothing out of it . What a waste ..  
1	  I 've used other cassette adapters and they worked fine , but the sound quality for this product was terrible right out of the box . Only one stereo channel worked and the sound was quite garbled . Choose a different product .  
1	  I purchased this cable in hopes of using my laptop while connected to my Samsung 40 " TV . The TV has a " PC " VGA connector which is easily selectable from the remote . My first surprise was that the audio cable was only about 12 inches long . I needed one to be about 2 feet long in order to reach the audio output on the front right of my laptop . I carefully connected the cable to the TV and the laptop . The screw knobs were very short and did not have a screw driver slot . I fired up the computer and put the TV to the " PC " source . Nothing showed on the screen . I checked connectors on both ends for bent pins . The cable looked fine and was properly secured but provided no signal from the laptop . I borrowed a different brand of cable from a friend and it worked perfectly . I am returning the cable tomorrow and purchasing a different brand with a longer audio cable .  
1	  I bought my ILO recorder at Walmart and it has been nothing but trouble - it is unreliable and you can never be sure if it will record - keep on getting " bad disc " message every time the machine tries to finalize the DVD after recording . I have tried several different types of discs DVD + R and DVD + RW by different manufacturers and still have the same problem - I have stopped trying to record anything on this machine because it is just a waste of my time . The remote control is a nightmare . ILO service is a joke ; better to talk to a brick wall rather than try to get help from them . I cannot and will not recommend this machine to anyone - don't waste your money - buy a quality machine from a reputable manufacturer .  
1	  My dell Photo 964 and this server weren't compatible . I think it is my printer 's problem not the server 's .  
1	  Well , everyone was right . I take back anything good I ever said about this piece of crap . The item sucks , the customer service sucks and I 'm taking it back today . Instead of calling it a & quot ; portable & quot ; DVD player , it should be called a & quot ; Disposable & quot ; DVD Player ! It worked beautiful for about a month . After that it 's garbage , just like your money . DON'T BUY IT ! You 've been warned .  
2	  I received a " Product Red " Nano as a Christmas present from my husband . I 've been the owner of an iPod Mini since Christmas of 2004 . Fortunately I had the extended warranty with that one ( and I have it with the Nano as well ) , because I went through 7 minis in the span of two years . I was reluctant to become a Nano owner , but I 'm truly glad I did . I still want to use my iPod mini and needed to address the issue of sharing iTunes with two different types of iPods . I read previous reviews of the Nano and prepared myself for a headache . I have to say that initially it was as I was not even able to manually load my songs onto the Nano . After finally ( after talking with 2 unhelpful customer services techs ) getting a very knowledgeable person ( magic words if you are having a problem is " product specialist " ) at AppleCare he fixed the problem . To share multiple format iPods , each one needs to be assigned a separate computer drive . Doing this allows you to manually copy songs from iTunes onto your Nano . My husband further suggested that I not go through a USB hub but rather have the iPod connect directly to the USB port . When I connected directly to the USB port I was able to copy the songs automatically . Today I had my first long workout ( 3 + hours ) with it at the gym . I hardly knew the device was on my arm , it stays in place ( my iPod mini on an armpad doesn't always stay in place ) , and best of all sounded awesome . Now all I need to do is load some new music on it . I 'm giving this 4 stars only because I think Apple needs to do more to educate customers on how to do certain things with their products . I searched the Apple web site for information regarding my issue and there isn't much there . I mentioned this to their " product specialist " and he said he 's heard it before . They also need to stop the practice of giving refurbished models to replace ones that have to be returned and are under warranty . It 's no different from having a refrigerator that you purchased the extended warranty for .. if that dies because of a manufacturer problem you get a new one ( happened to us this summer ) .  
2	  Very pleased with this unit as it has a very clear sound , both the bass and treble are superb , even on my MP3 player and CD 's . And it has a very RICH AND LOUD sound , reaches a high level of sound ! I bought this unit because it is a neck style headphone and also because of the built in volume control ( perfect for the traveler ) . For the money , this is a wonderful headset . And Amazon was so quick with the shipping . Very happy !  
2	  This card was easy to install and worked flawlessly . Using Network high speed testing software the card demonstrated that it speeded up my Network connectivity dramatically .
