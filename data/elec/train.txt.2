2	  Seems like good quality , and fairly inexpensive . I 'd probably go with the targus UV + Polarizer for $ 20 , though . Silver color doesn't look as bad as I thought it would , but I prefer black .  
1	  There was no prior info regarding the inability to use the cable when transferring from Vista to Vista . Naturally ' I never would have purchased it if I had kn own .  
2	  If you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the Nikon 4300 ! After a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , I initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality ( 4 Mega Pixel ) . After using it for about a month , I can state unequivocably that this Nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck . Its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of Nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake . Yes , the picture quality and features ( which are too numerous to mention ) are unmatched for any camera in this price range . The design and construction are excellent - as is the legendary quality of the Nikon optics . I own a 35mm SLR camera and this is my second digital . If you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the Coolpix 4300 !  
2	  Very happy with the service and the product . Delivered a day before estimated . Was set up and running . The delivery people cleaned up after themselves and were very courteous . Have had the TV approximately 1 month . No problems , works well with everything we have . Love it ! The price dropped $ 303.00 . I called Amazon and they promptly refunded $ 303.00 . Thank you Amazon  
2	  This has been a great 1st camera - easy to use but the biggest complaint is that no matter what setting you use - it is not good at removing red eye . The other feature it lacks is that you cannot print the date on the photo , that has to be done by a printer with that option . If you don't want to have to edit every photo and have the date stamped on it , this is not the camera for you . Otherwise , it takes nice clear shot and it 's great to travel with as it has a good zoom . I have had it 3 years and no mechanical problems at all even though it has been dropped a couple times .  
1	  I have this camera for 3 years . The image quality is OK , optics are good . Battery life is good . Now 3 years later cameras have bigger displays , but thats not a negative point for this camera as it came out in a time this size was usual . The big bad thing with this camera is its respond time , and this really makes the good things pretty useless . It needs about 1-2 seconds from the moment I hit the shoot button until it actually takes the picture , and I have had so much occasion with peoples , where this ruined the take . Specially with kids , you have a good moment and shoot , but the picture is taken long after the good moment passed away . Also the time the camera needs to save the image after the take is extremely slow , there go other 10 good moments until the cam is ready again . Maybe the save file time can be shortened with a better highspeed flash card , the one I use is a standard card . But it will still be too much time to save the image . I am going now purchasing a Canon Powershot A710 .  
2	  even came with a sd adapter for just $ 3.00 thanks for the fast send and the great pricing . i dont really have anything more to put just amazing  
2	  Regarding the highlighted review by L. Wimberley : The Digital Rebel XT is equipped to detect whether you 're shooting horizontally or vertically . To do so , there may be a free-hanging piece within the camera to detect which way is up as you hold the camera . This may be what 's making the rattling sound . The sensor is handy , as the camera uses this data to auto-rotate images in the viewfinder for you when they were shot vertically .  
2	  I got this for my Kindle Fire and it fits perfectly . There are many ways to adjust it so you can always find the perfect angle . And the price is unbeatable to make it perfect ! I highly recommend this product .  
2	  As HDMI devices become more and more prevalent , these kind of cables are naturally going to drop in price . That said , I don't think I 've ever spent so little to get so much . Composite cables used to run me $ 5-$10 bucks a shot ( and at places like Radio Shack , even more ) , but to find a set of quality cables at such an exceptional price is a home run . Excellent cables for upgrading any existing component / composite setup .  
1	  I thought it was supposed to " ultra-quiet " . Yes , it keeps my laptop cool , but the reason I chose it was because of the misleading product title .  
1	  This is the wrong memory i ordered it is home just lying don't have use for it .  
1	  on my last trip my friend had one she bought on the plane and it worked great . I bought this one recently , went overseas and it did not work .. then came back and found out that the return window had expired .. so basically paid for something that didn't work and can't even get my money back on top of the huge inconvenience given I hadn't brought with many the many adapters I used to carry with me .. very , very unhappy !  
1	  I just received a Tiffen UV filter that I ordered refurbished . Correct me if I 'm wrong , but I thought refurbished meant the product was checked and any defects were corrected . However , when I opened the package , the glass was full of spots which look engrained in the glass . Not only am I saddened by the fact that I can't use this and expect decent pictures , but I also don't have a UV filter to use for my new camera . I 've been holding off on taking pictures , and now I have to wait even longer . I plan to return the product and visit a store locally . I don't know if Amazon warehouse is to blame , or the manufacturer . From what I read on customer feedback , the lens is a big heartache anyway . I should have went with my initial instinct and got the Hoya .  
2	  I have been using this camcorder little over than 1 year . This has great features especially optical and digital zoom . Never used EIS , MagicVu features but I am sure I will someday . Easy accessibility to the DV cassette ( to remove and replace ) . Ergonomic features like zoom , record buttons . Blank search is really helpful . Memory card that comes with the cam is useless and also the pictures are not that good . Have to buy i . Link interface cable to transfer videos to Pc as its taking too long with USB cable . Battety life is less but you have to buy a spare one . Overall this camcorder is a good one and worth to buy than a Sony which has less features for the same price .  
1	  It is not a Quick-release head tripod ! and it is a bit too short .  
2	  Do I win for lamest review title ? Anyway , Logitech has a knack for making great products , and this mouse is no exception . Perfectly responsive , ergonomically designed , and the scroll wheel is .. um .. scrolltastic ! Great product overall , but especially if you 're a frequent computer user . Seeing as how you 're shopping on Amazon , I 'm assuming you are .  
1	  My paycheck is based on how fast I type while retaining quality . With the spacebar wearing out on my old faithful ergo-friendly split keyboard , I was out to find at least an equal , if not better , replacement . When I saw this keyboard I was so excited by the design , I hardly even blinked at the significant price but now wish I had . The 1 star I gave this keyboard was for the ability to adjust the height and tilt - that aspect is fantastic and proved VERY comfortable , although it is a little awkward to adjust ( I 'm right-handed but the adjustment lever is on the left so I found it difficult to hold the keyboard in the position I wanted it while trying to lock the hand into place ) . Unfortunately , it did not make up for the other problems such as : 1 . After having used this keyboard for only 12 days , keys began to stick . The left-sided shift and Ctrl keys are continuously sticking . ( With the very short 10-day return policy , I 've now lost over $ 100 . ) 2 . The keys are very stiff and again , after using it for a time , they actually seem to get stiffer and tighter . They are to the point that the extra comfort I gained by the adjustable height / tilt is completely blown away by my aching fingers from having to press so hard on these keys . Though I prefer an extremely light touch , I have worked on firm keyboards and never had a problem . However , this one is so tight , I feel as though I am forcing the keys down and frequently miss letters because I didn't hit them hard enough ( and " hit " truly is an accurate description ) . 3 . Pressing a key at an angle ( for example , doing the 1-finger typing and reaching to the opposite side of the keyboard while it is tilted away from the approaching finger ) will not always make contact to type the letter . I have even deliberately pushed keys down with my finger slightly off-center and , on certain keys , it will not type until I slide my finger to the center of the key . 4 . The extra keys ( delete & extra backspace ) are poorly positioned . They are terribly uncomfortable to use with even minor frequency . It 's not that hard to get used to their location and I quickly became used to the new location of the other extra keys ( home , end , page up / down keys , arrows ) . The problem simply is that having to use the delete key by using the left little finger is actually uncomfortable and even interferes with typing if you use special combination command keys ( i.e. , Ctrl + Del ) . 5 . Not having the " calculator " number pad is more bothersome than I would have expected . It 's not a hidden problem when purchasing this keyboard and the buyer is made aware of it so this complaint is partially my own fault . I don't use it in a manner I consider " frequent " and therefore did not think I would miss it that much - I was wrong . Although I don't use it that much , when I want to and don't have it , I have found it very annoying and cumbersome to use the # s across the top of the keyboard rather than that nice little NumLock pad ( as well as the arrows that were there ) . These can be purchased separately but that increases the cost of your keyboard to around $ 50-$60 and it 's already twice the price of good , comfortable keyboards . I had high hopes for this keyboard and the potential was obviously there so , with stars in my eyes , I bought it . It 's around 2 weeks later and I 've already ordered a new keyboard ( basic ergo split keyboard ) and plan to hide this one away in a cabinet , only to be taken out for use as an emergency backup . It 's too bad the great potential of this keyboard is so completely wasted .  
2	  If you find one in good shape - BUY IT ! I bought one locally off Craigslist very cheap , with intention to listen to SACD . I was extremely impressed of sound quality and soon after , I bought a second H / K DVD48 off eBay .. I never found one here .. This is the best SACD played for on budget listeners , without compromising sound quality !  
1	  It did not work as advertised . Although it fit my joystick , it was incompatible , and the computer did not recognize that there was anything plugged in .  
2	  Great price , had it within a week from ordering . very happyworks great , cuts 6 wire phone line good .  
2	  Installation went without a hitch and it has worked great from the beginning . Perhaps it 's a bit more expensive than others , but I 'd rather pay more for a trouble free product .  
1	  If it were , it would have been designed with a sleeve that didn't fall off in your pocket , when you don't notice it , etc . It comes with three sleeves ( is this an admission of a design flaw ? ) , and in less than 3 months , I 've lost all three . It 's no longer a portable keychain usb drive , if it 's unprotected in your pocket . If you plan on using this as a daily workhorse , in and out of your pocket , you 'll soon lose the caps and sleeves .  
2	  This is a great TV ! The picture is amazing , clear as a bell !  
1	  When you buy something from Amazon , they give you this little idea section that says " customers that bought this . Also bought that " Well , I took their advice and got this item , it was the wrong size for my camera . So either the customer that bought that item and their camera screwed up or amazon messed up . BTW , I have had this happened 2 other times so i think it is amazon being very confused ! BTW when you try and return it be prepared for amazon to make you pay s & h ; cause they say " It isn't our fault " . Maybe they should get the recommendation section fixed or start taking responsibility for suggesting something wrong . I never buy anything in the suggested area !  
2	  everything it claimed to be . plenty of ports . lights to tell you which are active . no problems  
2	  This wire was perfect for wiring my apartment with 5 speakers ( the sub-woofer uses a different kind of wire ) . At $ 16 it was priced right , but at the $ 29 I see it listed at now I would look elsewhere .  
2	  another great priced sony product on amazon .. great shipping , fast friendly .. and really easy to operate .  
2	  This is the best FM transmitter I 've purchased . I own two others that were not IPOD exclusive and they are trash . They are too bulky and have wires everywere , which make my car look messy . The XtremeMac is slim and looks like it belongs on the IPOD . If you own an IPOD and need an FM transmitter this is you best bet .  
1	  I thought this product would provide a way for my husband to listen to internet radio in another room while I am working on the PC . That 's what Logitech says it will do . So far , it seems to be doing that without problems . BUT ! I had problems with installation . The software does not recognize my computer or my sound card , so I can't select either of them as " default " unless I go to control panel>sounds and audio devices>audio tab>sound playback > default device . I WAS able to send Windows Media Player output to this device in the media player itself . ( Go to library > more options > devices > speakers > properties > sound playback and choose this device . ) Other applications ( such as iTunes ) do not have that option for use . Sound confusing and difficult ? Yep . Buyers beware .. there is NO support from Logitech for this product . The only support I found was at the users forum :[ .. ] Good luck .  
1	  I am a Zune lover mainly because I hate itunes . I bought this Zune 30 GB used because I already had a great newer Zune and lost it . When I got this one I was pretty disappointed . It 's kind of big and clumsy by today 's standards . On top of that the music quality I 'm getting out of the this model isn't as good as on the newer Zune ( I know that 's hard to believe but certain instruments or vocals are really quiet on some songs .. it 's weird ) . My advice , don't buy this used . Go with a newer nicer Zune for a little more money and enjoy the fact that Microsoft has made a legit alternative to the ipod .  
1	  I bought these from another seller . Only 3-4 of the disks worked in my Philips CDR800 CD recorder . Even the ones that worked had issues-i . e . , I had to reboot the CD recorder after finalizing .  
2	  An important product if you are in a trip taking pictures or videos . Not much to say : just this memories are enough robust in quality .  
1	  I bought this item in February after seeing the good reviews and cheap price . It worked fine for about 6 months . Had some issue where I had to reconnect to my network after around 6 months . Then just a few days ago it just died . I see from the one star reviews that this isn't an isolated case and it looks like calling the company will require a couple hours of tech support . It 's not worth the hassle for $ 25 . I guess I am one of the unlucky ones . I will cut my losses , but will not buy D-Link again .  
1	  I bought this unit for playing region 2 DVD 's during a 5 week trip to Europe in September and October . However given that the tour was intensive I only used the unit a few times and then packed it away until I wanted to show a DVD of Venice to my family gathering at Christmas . I must have used it then maybe 2 or three times and then I noticed that something was wrong with the hinge on opening it . On closer inspection I found that the whole screen part of the unit was splitting apart . The unit was not dropped and was carried at all times in the DVD case I purchased for it . Presently I am trying to locate support with no success . B & H photo video from where it was purchased has deleted all information about it .  
2	  Luckily , I haven't experienced any of the issues with failure that other reviewers have noted . I 've shot with this card on numerous occasions and taken probably a few thousand photos with out issue so far . I 've used this card with multiple Nikon and Canon DSLRs . Losing work / images is never fun . I 'd suggest that anyone that has had issues with failure try and see if Transcend will offer them a replacement .  
1	  FROM THE FIRST SECOND THIS ITEM DIDN'T WORK . YOU HAD TO CONSTANTLY REBOOT IT TO GET CONNECTED . THE TECH SUPPORT ( AFTER 3 HOURS ) SAID IT WAS DEFECTIVE AND I SHOULD EXCHANGE IT . WHY WOULD I WANT ANOTHER PIECE OF JUNK . I RETURNED IT AS FAST AS I COULD AND GOT A BELKIN . NO PROBLEMS WITH IT . WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS MANUFACTURE AGAIN .  
1	  I purchased this Walkman after my previous Sony Discman plunged to its death on one fateful night in December . OK , well , I actually dropped it - but it was 3 + years old and had sustained many drops before . It was time for it to go , I suppose . Anyway , it was two days before Christmas and there wasn't much of a choice on store shelves , so I picked this up . I was thinking hey , it 'll probably be a good little CD player , having owned two previous Sony ones . And I was wrong . The problem with this player is the fact that it brags on the package " CD-R / CD-RW playback ! " , when in reality , it skips with nearly every brand of CD I threw at it , and no matter what type of software / computer burned the disc . It 'll play the first few tracks fine , sometimes ( albeit , rarely ) even the whole CD .. but generally it starts skipping midway through the CD . It was a disappointment , because my old one played CD-R 's perfectly , despite its age . It 's a shame , because for the money it would have been decent . It has nice sound and some nice features - but if you like to listen to your CD-Rs , this is not the most practical choice . In the end , I returned it and went for the Sony D-NE509 ATRAC3plus player . More expensive , but plays MUCH better .  
1	  I have had my TomTom go 510 for almost a month yesterday I made my first long trip and used it . The 510 preformed well . However the Preloaded Maps from Tom Tom are out of date by many years . eg , the address on my Home changed almost 6 years ago , the TT 510 could not locate my home or any other areas that have changed their address due to E-911 are unavailable also . There are NO Current Updates on TT web site to correct this problem , So Bottom line is this , the 510 works well but maps are really out of date , so if you buy one do your self a favor and buy a current road atlas at the same time . I will return my TT 510 to the seller this morning for refund and buy a New Road Atlas .  
2	  Both at home and in my work , I have the need to copy and move files - some of them with sizes up to a GB . For these occasions , I have purchased a slew of ' key ' , ' thumb ' and ' flash ' drives of various brands , capacities , speeds and sizes and have reviewed a couple of them here on epinions . Some performed better than others - all worked OK - but .. they all felt like added heft on my keyring . So much so , in some instances , that I wound up storing them in desk drawers - and then not having them with me at times when I needed them . What I had REALLY been hoping to find all along , was a device small enough to fit , lightly and unobtrusively , on my key ring with a full GB of storage capacity . I believe that I have finally found such a device and would like to be the first to introduce you to the OCZ Roadster . This review will be as brief and as to-the-point as is the device itself . No space wasted anywhere ! It measures an incredibly ( compared to most others ) small 1 1/8 " X 5/8 " X 3/16 " closed - and opens with plug available to a full length of just under 2 " . It is smaller , in fact , than any of the keys on my keyring ! But is quick and easy to use . The unit comes with a USB 2.0 connecting cable if your plug receptacle is positioned so as to make it necessary . Mine is not , as my ports at the office are right on the front of the CPU and at home they are also easy to reach . The cable is a handy addition if you need it , though . It is , of course , completely Plug and Play , transfers data and photos very quickly and adds literally no noticeable weight or ' heft ' to your key ring ! It seems to me to have achieved a better and more honestly functional version of what we really mean by ' portability ' and makes the perfect thumb drive if anything up to 2GB ( the larger size of the same device ) will meet your data storage and transfer needs . It would be MUCH improved if the ring fitting on it were metal instead of plastic .. I can see it won't last as long as the drive itself . As with all OCZ devices , it comes with a full 3-year warranty .  
1	  At first these headphones are great , but after a few weeks they stop working in 1 ear . Went through 4 pairs before switching to Koss KE29E headphones , which have not broken yet .  
1	  This battery was part of a package for the Nikon D5000 . However , it was dead out of the package-no lights on the charger came on .  
1	  I have always used the " compatible " printer cartridges simply because of the cost . I make tons of copies and the ink or brand name laser cartridges just cost too much . I have always been very satisfied with the quality of the print of the compatible cartridges until this one . It seems to put a small black line down the left edge of every page . It 's possible that it 's a problem with my printer but it wasn't doing this until I put in the replacement cartridge . Otherwise , the price is great and I 've had no other problems . I 'll go back to using other brands of compatible cartridges when this one runs out . 12/23/10 OK , a couple of months have passed and I am already on the " Low Toner " warning ! I have NEVER chewed through a cartidge this fast so I am added to the list of folks who did not get anywhere near the promised 2500 page yield . THEN , to add insult to injury , I had purchased 2 of these cartidges at the same time so I would have a spare ready and the second one is not recognized . What a pain ! I will find out the manufacturer of the other " compatible " cartridges that I have used in the past . They were fantastic ! These are not . Don't waste your time . these are NOT less expensive .. these are cheap .  
1	  this product lasted LESS than a year and we could not get it fixed ! Had to purchase an entirely new one ! Not happy about this one at all .  
1	  This was suppose to be a new cable , it wasnt . had rust and didnt work . i want my money back and cant contact the seller ..  
2	  I really cannot rate the product because I will not be using it . It is a gift for my grandson . I 'm sure he will love it .  
1	  It 's a very fast drive ! , I bought it after investigating on the Internet about very big and fast drives . I reached to the conclusion that I should buy an IBM or WD ( performance in mind ) , so I went and buy the WD ( despite of what I read in some customer reviews from other places about the reliability of the drive ) ; I was amazed with the performance of it , but after I week of use it died ( and by it i mean that the drive didn't start any more , it just make very ugly noises ) ; all data on it was LOST ! So i sent it to WD and is has been 15 days and I 'm still waiting for the replacement . If I could go back in time I would buy an IBM  
2	  I purchased these earphones specifically for covert listening at work but have found myself using them almost constantly , in favor of more expensive , but less portable headphones . For the price , I 'm quite impressed with the sound quality of this set . True audiophiles would want to invest in a higher-end set ( would true audiophiles even use earbuds ? ) , but I 'm very happy with the quality to value ratio of this pair . The earbuds are much more comfortable than I 'd anticipated . I have never been able to stand a pair of earphones , but found that the multiple size selections were helpful ( I still do wish the smallest size was a bit smaller ) . I agree that the cord is a bit awkward . I 'm told that the design ( uneven cord length , offset to one side ) is to prevent them from falling off onto the ground - by draping the longer cord around the back of one 's neck , and the cord connecting to the player to the front of one 's body . I do have to say that though this design does annoy me sometimes , it has prevented me from dropping the phones on grimmy sidewalks quite a few times . As for the earphones falling out when running , I 've also noticed this , but it seems to be due to the attached player being jostled , and thus , tugging at the cord . I 've found when I run on a treadmill or machine at the gym , if I put the player on a stationary surface , the cord does not tug and the earphones do not fall out . The set has actually turned out to be quite usable for working out .  
2	  Dropped right in . No mailing label to recycle the old one though . more empty words to please review entry box .  
2	  The Discs are colorfull and reminiscent of 45 rpm records . They do what they 're supposed to and remind you of back then .  
2	  I got the Pyramid 446 Gold series .. not sure if i was supposed to or not but they appear to be made pretty well and they do actually sound better than my 2 year old 60 $ Sony 4x6 's .. anyone with a good amount of audio experience will tell you to always buy round speakers because they sound much better !  
2	  This product is awesome . But there is a problem : The transfer rate is much lower . Thank you ..  
2	  These speakers are not bad at all so far and really easy to use . You don't have to fight with a receiver in order to get the speakers to work right .  
1	  A few years ago this would have been a perfectly acceptable AM / FM / MP3 player / recorder solution . Nowadays , the digital music / recorder market is flooded with competitors and this product is in danger of becoming obsolete . Compared to similar products on the market , the Radio Your Way LX has .. 1 ) Less battery life2 ) Less memory space3 ) Poorer interface4 ) More expensiveI was disappointed by this product and will be returning mine . I plan on purchasing the iRiver H10 20 GB MP3 Player / Recorder which is only slightly more expensive , but is also an excellent MP3 player . It can also handle the AM / FM radio recording-a feature that Radio Your Way previously had a monopoly on the market ( the iRiver documentation even says recording can be pre-set ) . Don't bother with the Radio Your Way LX .  
2	  I purchased these cause I started to get into golf . Lets face it , I lost plenty of balls the first holes . These were great to have for when I played with my buddies . I did not have to worry about not having enough . I dont know much about quality or what is consider a & # 34 ; good gold ball & # 34 ; , but for recreation use , I like these .  
2	  We bought these speakers to hook up to our wide screen TV . The larger the TV screen , the farther away from it you sit to enjoy it , and because of the greater distance , the louder you must crank up the TV volume to hear it . And this load volume can cause sound to reverberate into a room behind the TV where someone is trying to concentrate , study , or sleep and can make it painful to walk through the room where the TV is . These speakers hooked right up to the RCA audio outputs on the back of our TV using adapters that came right in the box . In fact , they setup up quickly and correctly right out of the box . We placed the speakers back where we watch the TV from , about 20 feet , and this allowed us to adjust them to a nice volume . We have heard a lot of background sounds on movies we own that we had not heard before . . . AND there are no more concerns with the TV volume being too loud ( as above ) . In fact , we can mute the TV and it has no effect on the speakers . One small thing that could be improved : the remote control does not turn on the speakers ; it only adjusts their volume and turns them off .  
1	  All the tapes received were packaged as new but the quality of the tapes were poor for recording ( Streaks and snow with sound fading from loud to inaudible ) . The quality was the same on five different recorders . Do not purchase these tapes . I put this purchase in the category " Flimflams " .  
2	  This Harddrive works great and is what I am running my current OS on and was also a pretty good price at the time of purchase . Would buy again .  
2	  I bought these several months ago and have been using them almost every day since they arrived . Not only do they sound terrific , but they are surprisingly comfortable and do not fall out of your ears like the crappy earphones that come with most mp3 players nowadays ( and they sound MUCH better ) . I have very small ears , and the smallest silicon adapter size fits perfectly and will not fall out on their own even when running . If you do use them for exercising outdoors make sure to watch out for cars because these headphones block out background noise and you won't hear them coming !  
2	  I was surprised when I opened the CDs to discover that all of them were not gold in color , which is what I had expected . At least 2/3 of them were black , which is very hard to write on with a black marker .  
2	  Daughter loves it . She likes that she can charge her ipod and listen to music  
2	  I have three grades of the audioquest rca stereo cables the alpha snake connection ends are not quite the same as the sidewinder or the copperhead sets . I believe the value is certainly there for the snake . The fit to connector is good and tight . The ends are substantial to grip onto when you connect / disconnect . I looked inside the end surround ; and the high priced cables have metal that comes inside towards the center to make a more complete contact with the component connection . The Alpa-Snake set is plastic surrounding the metal probe inside . One thing I find with the Sidewinder or Copperhead is they are so tight fitting I have to use some strength to connect / remove them from their connection . I equate that with connection quality . Sound will travel in either direction , regardless which way the arrow points . But the cue it provides is a fine idea .  
1	  This cover only lasted a couple of months and cracked at the sides . I emailed them and they told me I was outside the warranty window .  
1	  Camera diedThis review requires that I write ten more words . Word , word , word , word , word , word , word , word , word , word .  
1	  Don't buy this or any other cheap sets like this . Repair parts for this particular set are no longer available .  
1	  This thing sucks so bad I don't even know how to fully express it 's rotteness . My cd player doesn't fit inside of it . What kind of cd player would fit ? It 's too small its too chinsy and too crappy . I 'm so totally unhappy with this product . You need to refrain from buying this .  
2	  I 've tried lots of cassette adapters : Belkin , Sony , Panasonic , Coby .. and others I 've forgotten by now . THIS ONE SOUNDS GREAT - it contains a little circuitry inside that enhances the music , especially the bass , without cutting the highs . Best sound you can expect from a device of this type , and surprisingly good . Mechanically sound as well - the others would stick ( and then eject ) or squeak annoyingly . This one is almost silent and has never stopped rolling in the cassette player . I had to replace my first one when the cord got caught in the car door and mangled the plug - and I went straight for another just like it . Highly recommended .  
1	  I order these for my wife . She wanted a headset for skype and some online courses . Easy to install , sound is loud and clear , excelent for chat and also it is confortable ( at least for 1 or 2 hours sessions ) . The only drawback goes for the drivers configuration . I order the USB version , so it has a sound card in it , which means I had to change between my computer sound card and the headset sound card every time I change from the headset to the speakers . UPDATED August , 13th ) Just to add some comments , its being almost 5 months since I bought it , as mentioned before , my wife is the one who uses it , mainly for online courses . The right earphone just stopped working this weekend . I checked the cable looking for some cut but nothing wrong , just notice that sometimes when pushing mute and another button togheter on the headset make the right side to work . So the piece is already malfunctional and probably will be dead in a few months . I 'm decreasing 2 stars because this phone didn't last a year .  
2	  Apple 's iMac G5 's velocity engine will be able to speed up games so that a high end graphics card simply isn't necessary . This 128 bit floating point unit will complement the graphics card in gaming logic . When the iMac G5 was announced , some critics were disappointed that it didn't contain a TV tuner . Well , you can connect your iMac G5 to a firewire enabled cable or satellite box to view and control standard and HD resolution TV using the free multimedia player called VLC . Search " HDTV MacOSX " on Google . I would suggest that any purchaser order the bluetooth option since this will allow you to use your cellphone as a remote control . This will be very useful if you have your iMac G5 wall mounted . For wall mounted iMac G5 's , you should look into a program called Envision that displays artwork from the web full screen $U$ Might as well get the Airport card too .

2	  My blue heeler puppy managed to climb over the baby gate I had blocking the entrance to my office and pulled these headphones off my desk . I came home and found my headphones lying on the floor and him asleep next to them . At first glance there was nothing wrong with the headphones ; they looked completely intact . Upon closer investigation I found that he had just about chewed clear through the coily cable , which was left literally hanging by a thread . I was upset at first but decided to test the headphones before losing my cool . I was amazed to find that they still worked , even in stereo . Of course , there was some static whenever I moved around with the headphones on , but the fact they still worked at all ( including in stereo ) after such abuse was a relief ( for me and the puppy ) . I wrapped the damaged cable with electrical tape and now , besides cosmetic issues , the headphones work just as new . I would definitely buy another pair if need be .. and douse them in dog repellent .  
2	  I love it and use it all the time ! It 's one of my most useful tools . It always works and works well . I recommend it , highly , to anyone .  
2	  The DVD door was lying loose in the box . Removed the front of my old DVD / VCR combo ( same make and model ) and installed it on the one purchased . Purchased this new one as rebuilt , wasn't sure what to expect . The description for it in the listing didn't state that the DVD door was unattached . The DVD & VCR player work fine . If it lasts a year or two , then it was $ 70 well spent .  
2	  I ordered this product to eliminate the tangled web of cords connecting our router with other technology . Stores don't seem to stock Cat5 cable shorter than 7 feet , so I was delighted to find the one-footer on Amazon . com . It fits perfectly and my office space is visually improved .  
2	  Pros : Good soundMassive upgrade if you don't already have a subLightweight , durableCons : Slight crackling when turned on full2.1Weird , random spasms , rare but annoying  
2	  i read a lot of revues before purchasing this rca speaker wire . it is truly 16 ga . just as it was described , and if you watch the price it will change in your favor . great product .  
2	  This light dimmer is great for table lamps all over your home , you can dim the bright lights and makes any room more soothing and relaxing . These dimmers are better than a three-way bulb , because a three-way usually burns out on the first setting and you are stuck with all that bright light or either replace with another bulb . The dimmers are also more energy efficient than leaving your light on bright . I have wall dimmers on all my other lightings . I would highly recomment these dimmers to anyone .  
2	  The product was a little confusing to set up but after reading the instructions ( it helps to read the intructions ) I got the system up and running in a fairly complicated setup . The product works great and I recommend the product .  
2	  Light , compact , and the best part is the retractrable slim USB cord . Goes everywhere , in my drawer , the glove compartment , my business bag .. On a mac , it is a breeze .. just plug it in and go in your System Preferences , select keyboard / mouse , find your little keypad , and voil & agrave ; , you are typing numbers ! My only downside is that the z & eacute ; ro key should be in a recess for the thumb , but still I don't intend to do " data entry " all day long , it is really a very minor thing and not worth complaining about it . All and all , a very good purchase , I recommend it , and it is probably the cheapest and most versatile on the market right now ! A. Bauhart , Bristol , Rhode Island  
2	  I received the case yesterday and took it on a hike in pretty heavy woods today . I got fine reception . And you can manipulate the controls OK . Screen covered by plastic to protect but that was not a problem . FYI - I ordered from Amazon and used their free shipping option . They bluffed and said 7 to 9 days . I said OK . I actually recieved the order by UPS in 23 , yes 23 hours , after placing order !  
2	  Worked perfectly with Win7 64bit right out of the box . No need to update drivers or hunt drivers like I have seen many people say is needed with certain Bluetooth adapters . Getting it setup with my Palm Centro was a little confusing at first , but that was Palms fault , not the adapters ( on screen instructions on the Palm were a little screwy ) . Finally just decided to keep hitting next on the phone till the end of setup and see what happens , and to my surprise it worked flawlessly . I was really impressed with the speed of the Hotsync , it seems to be about the same speed as the USB cable was before I got this new computer . This phone is the only Bluetooth device I currently have , so I have no way to test it with other devices . But I 'm impressed either way since I took a flyer on this .. I must have posted on 10 different websites asking for info on Win 7 64bit compatible adapters , and nobody ever responded to me , and Microsoft compatibility website was no help at all . I am really happy I got it right on the first try without having to test out a bunch of different adapters to find one that worked .  
2	  This meter has the functions that I needed at a good price . The white bubble is cheap , though . Anyway , I have used all of its functions at one time or another . If this unit was more rugged , it would be five stars . As is , four stars .  
2	  I have been using the SE530PTH for well over seven months now , and I have officially concluded that there is NOTHING else that I would use to listen to music on the go . Once I tried these initially , I instantly used my employee discount to pick up a set and listened to as much lossless and high-bitrate MP3s as I could . I could pick apart instruments in various locations with these earphones on , which I have never heard before . The low-end was pronounced , but not overbearing . The mid-range is untouchable by any IEM on the market today . The highs are precise and clear , a hint of harshness is detectable , but definitely not a deal-breaker . I have used the Triple . fi 10 , Klipsch Custom-3 / Image , Westone UM1 , and Bose Triport IEs since I purchased these . They don't come close . What you MUST do with these earphones to maximize their potential is get a high-quality source . Plugging these directly into an unamped iPod will net decent results ( primarily due to these earphone 's sensitive nature ) , but the lack of a customizable EQ and weak power output will mean that you will not be driving these earphones to their full potential . I personally use a Cowon D2 , because of its high power output and FLAC / OGG support . The biggest draw of the SE530 is the fact , you can make these earphones sound any way you desire . EQ these babies any way you want them to sound , they can handle it with no distortion . If you listen to high quality audio , you can't go without these . I promise .  
1	  Not sure what 's up , but doesn't work on my computer . I half expected this , but it was worth a shot to try out .  
1	  PROS : Cheap with a Sony badgeNice displayPlenty of them aroundCONS : Battery life is woeful ! States : 3.5 - 5hrs Really : 2hrs ( at most ! ) Packed full of trailware , adware , etc . WTF ? Toshiba ' starter ' hard-drive is problematic : read : foo-baa'dGets hot , really , really quickly . Optical drive is clunky , loud and slow .. :( Support ? What 's that .. :( Verdict : I was really looking forward to this lappy but I 've realised it is not really a Sony , i.e , Made In Japan . This Chinese shocker is a pure revenue-raiser from Sony and they should know better than to put their name to this quality of product - too many bean-counters in the top jobs these days I guess . Take my advice : stay away from the Onyx model that is made in China ! Hate to say it but this thing STINKS !  
2	  I use my Zen for music and for listening to audio books I download from the libary . I also like the Line In feature which is great for converting old tapes to digital format . You play an audio book from a tape player and use the Line In cable to convert it . Works great . Here 's a nice trick for removing Windows DRM protection from audio files . Play them on your computer and record them immediately to disk by using a $ 4 cable from RadioShack to connect the microphone jack to the headphone jack on your computer . Bingo , you 've got an mp3 file . Then just copy it to your Zen player . The Zen V Plus stores photos and acts as a voice recorder . I especially like the BOOKMARK feature . You can set up to 10 bookmarks - this is important for listening to audio books and long podcasts . 2GB is plenty of storage space for several audio books and enough for 1000 songs . The sound quality is great on the Zen V Plus and the menus are easy to navigate . This is a nice player and you really can't go wrong . It 's a bit thicker than an Ipod but shorter . Nice feel to it .  
1	  I received this product and was initially pleased . However , in only two days of use , the belt clip broke , the front of the case opened on impact , and my iPod fell two feet to the ground . I would not recommend this product to anyone .  
2	  I bought this 1GB memory kit for my Dell Dimension E310 . It was very easy to install and now my computer works better than before . If I have went with Dell 's memory , it would have cost me more than $ 100 plus shipping .  
1	  That pretty much says it all : One of the ear cables just straight up broke off the main cable after two weeks . Nuff said . Do not buy .  
1	  SANDISK was destroyed by PostOffice sorting machine , because seller put item in a letter envelope and had the nerve to charge me $ 4.95 for a 64 cents mailing . His putting item in an ENVELOPE caused the post office to run it through their sorting machine , which then destroyed the SanDisk . How do I get my money back ?  
1	  Does Not work with Bose .. Griffin Dock Adapter for iPod shuffle 2G ( White ) .. I Bought three I 'd read online it would wok .. No it 's to big .. finally found a device that you plug into the back ! ~  
2	  Dual handles , case and shoulder are included . Both well designed and comfortable . The shoulder strap is especially well designed for ease , comfort and balance . Good space usage . Why the CD add on holder I have no idea . Almost a throwaway piece or use it in your car maybe . Nicely done inner side pocket to keep documents safe and the computer is well protected from most any kind of harm . Overall a good buy for a quality case . Amazons typical good price and efficient delivery !  
2	  These are perfect for working out - they don't fall out of your ears or off of your head . Work great with mp3 players . My only complaint is that sometimes when plugged into the audio jack of the tv on the treadmill , they give a teeny little shock to my ears . Other than that , they are fantastic . Well worth the low price .  
1	  Not much better than an old cheap transistor radio in sound quality . I bought it to listen to CDs at bedtime , but I can't bear to hear music on it . A very regrettable purchase . I 'm replacing it asap .  
1	  I never received the 2 Year Replacement Plan for the Pure Digital PSV-352 60 Minute Point-and-Shoot Camcorder ( Purchased on 12/07/2006 ) I purchasde at the same time I purchased the Plan . Although I paid for it , it was never received .  
1	  My mother and I both bought brand new iTrips , and within two months , both were broken ( mine broke within weeks ) . The iTrips have no warranty and break very easily . Sound quality is decent at best ; expect random interference , and the weak signal crumbles at higher volume . If you are considering an FM transmitter for your car , casette decks are much less expensive and have far better sound quality than even the best FM transmitters . I strongly suggest you give this particular transmitter a miss .  
2	  Over-all this monitor has been pretty good . My first monitor was the Sound N Lights Monitor With Dual Receivers which cost twice as much as this one and it only picked up static and nothing else . I love the indicator lights and the glowing night-light . My biggest complaint is the batteries do not last long in the receivers . I only have the receivers on during the night and it seems like I 'm replacing the batteries every week ( and they are new batteries ) . The only time the receivers have " static fits " is when the batteries are getting low and the green light on the bottom turns yellow so you know what the problem is . Over-all this monitor is a good monitor and picks up everything that it needs to .  
1	  Tried to use this headset with my iPhone 4 and this MX500C headset picks up electrical noise constantly . My Plantronics M214C Headset with Adjustable Volume works OK . With both of these headsets an adapter is required for use with the iPhone 4 3.5mm headset jack . I used [ Headset Buddy : 2.5mm Phone Headset to 3.5mm Adapter - Convert 2.5mm Headset to 3.5mm iPhone , Blackberry , Palm ] .  
1	  I should have known that this simple film camera wasn't going to work out because there are zero reviews for it anywhere . But how could one point and shoot camera be that bad ? When we opened the box , the camera wasn't the same as the one we ordered . It bothered me a little , but whatever - I was sure the one I got was nice as well . Put the batteries in but the camera never worked .  
2	  i bought the nuvo 360 just after Christmas . so far it 's performed very well . it links great with my bluetooth phone making handsfree talking easy on the road . i 've only found a couple of mistakes in directions and those were in areas with a ton of one way streets and lots of parking lots . the maps are up to date . my only concern is that the screen has frozen up a couple of times . however , the reset button works great and i haven't ( fingers crossed ) lost any data . I did take the time to dump all the foreign language info to free up memory . would definitely recommend .  
1	  Horrendous product , DON'T EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS ! You may think that " ohh , it 's only a couple of bucks , I don't have much to lose " , but you 're definitely going to lose that money ! If you 're really thinking of buying it just go out and give it to a homeless guy instead !  
2	  This is the lightest most appropriate USB mouse for a laptop . Therefore , when the first one developed a crack in the cable , I immediately replaced it with a new one . I have wound the part of the cable near the mouse with electrical tape in hopes that this will prevent the kind of breaking which my first one suffered . Unfortunately , those selling this product have by now figured out that there is nothing else on the market which is just like this one . Therefore , the price has gone up from $ 11 . to almost $ 30 . I therefore recommend winding electrical tape around the first inch of the cable from the get-go so you won't have to buy this product twice .  
2	  I got the 15pack just to see it I like it and if it burns well . MySony 12x SATA Black Blu-Ray Burner BD-5300S-0B - Bulk ( Black ) had no problem as I expected . I picked this because it was the cheapest brand I found in the store . Other BD-r at this price had the white print on surface that I didn't like . The top is a silver clear color not the blue of the memorex . I found 4x burning to be a bit long . From 45-60 mins for 20-23.3gb . The disc max space is 23.3gb not the 25gb on the label . Where the 1.7gb goes i don't know . You only lose a few mb on dvd from 4.7 to 4.5ish , but this a lot . The 6x speed model are few and quite expensive .  
1	  The clock is hard to read . The background lights up instead of the numbers . The CD player does not remember the previous track location . I use the CD player to listen to books . When the CD player is stopped , it restarts on track number 1 .  
2	  Great price and the memory works just fine . Make sure it is seated properly and firmly .  
1	  I thought this was going to be a great install for my radio , but it didn't really fit right and so now iv'e got to let my radio either hang low in the slot for it , or jam something in there to close the gap ..  
2	  We at the LIMC not only research quality , we research the market as well . The prices of these beautiful televisions cost alot , however the cost will be reduced by half by the end of the year . Save your money and have Santa get you one for Xmas .  
2	  I tested these and they do float my Steiner Observer 7 x 50 binoculars . And it does not need the clip-loc fittings as mentioned in another review . That is the case for the model 769 . The 768 model ( which this one is ) has a simple nylon strap that loops around a post on the binoculars and clips back on itself .  
2	  Great bag for organising all of your computer stuff . Has plenty of room . Looks pretty neat on the outside as well as in the inside . I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a notebook case .  
2	  The first unit we received was defective but was replaced very promptly . The replacement unit does just what it is supposed to do . The only thing that keeps it from being 5 star is the fact that the first one didn't work so it leaves a nagging reliability question in the back of my mind .  
2	  I bought an archos for travel . It performed well and doesn't have the downloading limitations of the Ipod . Plus the size . 160 gb is plenty and some . I could keep a hundred shows and movies on it with room to spare for music and pics . I don't like the necessity of purchasing plugins . The menus can be time consuming when compared to the Ipod . The rolly thing on the Ipod is so much faster . To me the pros outweigh the cons . Get one today . The 05s look pretty cool . They have wifi unlike the 04s .  
1	  I have had numberous back covers and most of them crack at the corners a few weeks after installation . This one is still perfect . I love the rubberized plastic feel , helps with it not sliding around on your hand . Update : Had the cover for less than a month , and one of the tabs on the side that holds it on snapped off . I am not rough with my ipad , and it does not get dropped . I take very good care of things . Now it 's useless .  
1	  Buyer beware : this is no longer the same product . Maxell has recently changed their audio CDRs . Formally , they were manufactured in Japan ; now they are made in Taiwan . All the older Maxell discs would play in EVERYTHING . However , a large percentage of discs in this new CDR media are defective . The new discs will no longer play in my Panasonic boom box or in my Honda car stereo . Worse , some of these CDs will fail to play in anything after a few days .  
2	  I 've had 2 other FM transmitters ( A Belkin and a Griffin iTrip ) . Neither came close to the quality of this transmitter . Neither charged the iPod ( The Belkin required batteries , which only lasted about 15 hours of use ) , while the iTrip worked OK at first , but then started getting static no matter what station I used . In fact , I had to have the iPod in hand for the static to go away ( and then , it was still not clear ) . The sound isn't as loud as some ( it takes over the volume control , so you cant use the volume on the iPod . ) Still , it 's not nearly as soft as some I 've seen . I found most music came through at a good volume ( I did adjust a few songs in iTunes to pump them up ) . This unit , although it seems cheap and flimsy at first , is able to get a consistant , strong signal , even on stations which usually come in clearly . It powers through them , and the result is a very clean sound . It is a little hard to read at the regular angle , but once you set the 3 presets , you don't need to see the screen . Just set your radio to the same 1-2-3 configuration . Also , turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer . In all , I couldn't be happier .  
2	  I have used this card in the past very successfully . Purchased several to use for an upcoming trip to Disney World .  
1	  I bought this because my existing wireless network was very weak and slow on lower level of my duplex apartment . Before installing this , I had about a 10 % signal at any given time , and it would take about 2 minutes to download 10 megs or so , which is REALLY slow given my cable connection . After the incredibly difficult ( I have set up quite a few wireless networks before , and I do IT consulting for a living , so I can only imagine how difficult this must be for someone without networking knowledge to install ) setup process , my signal downstairs did improve dramatically , to 95 % , but the speed seemed to be reduced even further , to the point where it was near unusable . Overall - If you can get it working , it WILL expand the range of your network . The sacrifice , however , is that any connection from this extended ranged will be slower than normal .  
1	  I 've had this router for about a year . It worked decently for a time . Recently , I noticed the numbers for the wired connections had turned orange . That 's odd , I 'm pretty sure they had been green . Yes , after checking my dad 's identical model , they were green . So I figured it had something to do with how hot the unit was getting . I had read others talking about overheating issues . I unplugged it and didn't use it for awhile . After plugging it back in , the numbers were back to green and everything appeared to be fine . Then came yesterday . The unit suddenly powered off , and I have not gotten it to turn back on since . I would open it up and tinker with it , but I 'm pretty sure it 's not worth my time .  
1	  One star because there is no Black Hole rating . This keyboard KILLED my PC . After installing the supplied driver I got a BSOD that told me my PC could not be booted . I did not notice until afterwards that the driver CD said WINDOWS 98 - after all this keyboard is for people with poor eyesight ! The BSOD kindly informed me that if I had installed any new hardware and drivers to please uninstall them which I couldn't , natch , because I could not get past the Blue Screen of Death . I hate sarcastic error messages . Tried Last Good Config , Safe Mode , everything I could think of . Could not boot , period . I hadn't backed up my data for a week and lost a lot of time consuming Photoshop work . Thank goodness for external hard drives as at least I had most of my work saved . Still , it took me nearly 36 hours straight to get my spare PC configured and set up . Now I have to buy a new Spare PC . What a nightmare .  
2	  this was packaged nicely and exactly like described .. if this is what you were looking for its a must buy =)  
2	  Great for the price , haven't really put it to the test quite yet , but have used it a little and it seems to work very smoothly !  
1	  Samsung Maxima 105 GL QD Zoom Date 35mm CameraThe order was diff . than it is shown , Camera dose not function at all , the camera is has marks all over , it is very old . seller dose not respond at all to the emails . I give it a 0 for services , and item the sold  
2	  I bought this camera 3 months ago . It takes wonderful photos with very little bother . I use a card reader .. to download 128M of photos very fast . I have had no problem with Windows XP after downloading from the Toshiba website the updated drivers . The image qualities are excellent and the camera is easy to use . A great , practical camera at an affordable price .  
2	  You can't go wrong with the money it works great . nice case for any 10 inch DVD player .  
1	  If you do a lot of printing on cd labels , business cards , etc . this is not the printer for you . The printer has an annoying habit of forgetting settings when the paper is changed resulting in a lot of wasted ink . The printer would either ignore margin settings ( printing to the edge of the page , which would be fine if that is what I had wanted ) or printing in such a way that the ink smeared ( this is on card stock designed to be used with ink jet printers ) even after several minutes exposed to air . As you can imagine this gets old after 10 wasted sheets of specialty paper and ink cartridges that go from full to empty . This is a problem with every all-in-one I 've purchased from HP ( like the F335 ) so it is definitely a problem with HPs internal workings . Customer support didn't seem too surprised with my problems and suggested that I take it to a tech center for " tweaking " . Um .. sure . Just what I expect to do with a brand new printer . Again , printing on normal paper isn't a problem , so if that is all you do or just need a home fax machine with occasional printing needs this printer is fine . Just beware of using anything else !  
1	  It 's cheap and the cheapness shows . I was quite disapoointed with the quality of the ink . Will not buy it again .  
1	  Bought this for my Canon 5D . Used it once and suddenly my camera went berzerk . Had to send it off to Canon for $ 250 service . Tried to use it again and when I pushed the button it fired repeatedly and I immediately disconnected it for fear that it would result in another $ 250 service fee . Refuse to use it now . Poor product . Lesson learned .  
1	  For this price I would rather buy Radeon 9800 , Radeon 9800 will Over clock at Pro , And the diffrence with ATI and Nvidia is huge especially with AA enabled .  
2	  I 've been into photography for over 30 years . During that time I 've owned quite a number of film point and shoots and SLR 's . During the last 10 years I 've owned a number of point and shoot digitals , super-zooms , and now my first Digital SLR . Manufacturers included Agfa , Canon , Casio , Contax , Leica , Nikon , Panasonic , Pentax , and Sony . During my DSLR search , I looked at Nikon D80 and D200 's . Canon Digital Rebel , EOS 30D and EOS 5D , and Pentax 100D and 10D , Sony Alpha , and of course the Panasonic DMC-L1 . My search started by pouring over specs and reviews at various sites including DPREVIEW and Steve 's Digicam . Then I took an in person look at all but the L1 at various camera stores . I can't express the level of disappointment I experienced when handling these cameras in person . All of the sub $ 1000 models felt like cheap plastic junk . Flimsy ports and doors , rough cheap feeling controls , and flexing bodies abound , Even the upscale ( supposedly ) metal bodied units did not feel much better . And all of the included kit lenses were complete trash - all plastic , horrid feeling controls , and SLOW . Now thats not to say some of these can't take great pictures , but I just can't get past the build quality and feel . So the one camera I could not find in local stores was the Panasonic DMC-L1 . The reviews all seemed to talk about the great build quality , the quality of the Leica lens , and pretty much panned most of the technology , ergonomics , and actual picture quality . In desparation , I ordered one mailorder ( from Amazon ) . While I was slightly disappointed in the build quality ( feel and materials ) , it was heads and tails above anything else I handled . You could actually feel the metal . Controls were much smoother and you got the impression this was higher quality product . Well it WAS more expensive than any of the others ( except the 5D ) so I guess that fits . You just don't get much for $ 1999 ( actually ( $ 1600 ) these days . After handling and using the L1 for a couple days I find most of the things listed as Cons in the reviews were from prototypes and Panasonic seems to have corrected them in the production version . Feel is good , ergonomics are good , focus is fast , picture quality is terrific and noise is effectively controlled . Live View works great and is much faster than I expected . The viewfinder is definitely dimmer than a Pentax , but on par with the low end of some other big name manufacturers and its definitely not " unusable " . Viewfinder image size is also smaller than some of the above , but larger than others . All in all I am pleased with this product and for those with traditional values like myself where quality and feel is as important as function , this product is worth a look .  
1	  Saw a deal for 48 batteries so I wanted to give it a try and the price is same as 48 Kirland AA battery . I was very skeptical about this battery but I am not so disappointed . I borrowed a battery tester from kid 's science project : consist of 1kohm load and 4 small light bulbs ( will uploaded picture ) . I tested this battery vs Kirland and the result is shocking : - Sony Stemina , exp 2017 : lasted 20 mins - Kirkland , exp 2016 : lasted 2 hours .  
1	  The GPS couldn't pick up the sattelites while I was in downtown Ottawa , Canada . Afterward , it couldn't pck up any signals even we are in suburd of Ottawa with no high rise building . In the states , the GPA works fine .  
2	  To me low light sensitivity is one of the most important things . I was going to buy a DSLR , but after reading reviews of this camera decided to give this one a try . While a DSLR has a bigger and more sensitive cell this camera is great for a compact . I get great inside and outside pictures . Note the ISO is manually adjustable despite what was said by another reviewer . Note while many consider a propritary battery a minus the lithium-ions don't self discharge and this camera has such great battery life I have never come close to discharging it .  
2	  LaCie 301156U 1 TB Ethernet Big Disk Network Attached Storage Hard Driveis doing everything as it is described in the product description . I Have a wired network consisting of 8 devices , PC / Printer / etc . Even Linux it works . Have since , ordered , received , and install the USB version only , and it also works great . 500GB for 99 bucks , how can you beat that ?  
1	  The very first wireless headphones that i own , and what a disappointment it is . sound quality is terrible even if i get VERY close to the transmitter . there would always be an annoying buzz in the background , or worse , echoes . please tell me what i am doing wrong . if this is what people call " as good as it gets , " then i would rather just stick with wired headphones instead . the BIGGEST problem i am having right now with it is that it AUTOMATICALLY freaking shuts down whenever my sound volume isn't set high enough to meet its standard . now why the hell does it do that ? do the designers want to turn me deaf ? i don't know about others , but i for one don't like to turn on my volume too high especially when wearing headphones because it 's unhealthy . why not give me the FREAKING power control ? is that too much to ask for ? i don't care about sound quality at this point , just don't turn off on me in the middle of music / movies . i wish i could get a refund and return this piece of junk .  
1	  Have had this for several years . The player actually works okay for both VCR and DVD use . However , the remote control is so poorly designed , I rarely use the unit . The buttons are small , and as another reviewer commented , pressing menu takes you back to the main setup , and you have to start over . It 's too bad , because as I said , I have had no technical issues with the DVD play , VCR play , or memory card . You will regret buying this unit . I use component hookup for my DVD , and have the sound connected to a Sony receiver control center . No technical issues at all . Still only a one . What a horrible remote .  
2	  I Decided to get this Combo player for two reasons initially . # 1 the upconversion of both the DVD AND VCR and # 2 It matches my Samsung LCD TV . Performance of this ubit so far has been exceptional , Great upconversion through the DVI output . It showed significant inprovement over the TV 's built in upconversion for the VDD and incredible improvement over my exixting 6 head toshiba VCR . One thing that was nice that they don't mention in the literature is that the VCR is SVHS compatible so you can take advantage of the higher image quality . Basically this unit exceds my performance standards that I was looking for picture and sound wise . Now for the issues :# 1 - You cant really stack anything on top of it or it fouls the loading mechanism of the VCR . I placed my LCD TV ( 23 " Samsung 21lbs ) on top of it and the top bowed enough so that the loading mechanism would get caught on the case . I fixed this myself with a little inginuity but it could cause others issue . # 2 - The Second issue which is a little more irritating is with the recorder . If you wish to record from VCR-DVD or visa-versa you MUST turn off the Progressive scanning . This is not an issue if you use the normal component video out however , if you use the DVI you cannot get a picture on your monitor ( I had to connect a second line to my TV to get recording to work ) . The other issue is that no where n the directions do they tell you this , I had to figure it out on my own . The DVD recording quality is very good though once you get it figured out . Other than that this unit is worth the money to me .. Though the manual could be much better and of course the stacking issue , but that is a minor thing .  
1	  The product information lists the measurements for this unit , but if you are like me measurements probably don't help you much . This MP3 player is huge . One reviewer wrote that it would easily fit in his hand or pocket , well so would my cell phone and guess what they are practically the same size . Compared to some of the Sony and Samsung units this thing is a Cadillac . The sound quality is very good , but not better than my wife 's Samsung , which she can easily clip to her shirt or put in her pocket . Putting this thing in my shirt pocket makes my shirt sag and putting it in my pants pocket . . . well , you get the idea .  
2	  I keep having to buy these because my cat chews through the wire if I leave them out . So , then one pair always turns into a bed-pillow version ( using only 1 ear ) while I watch something laying in bed . Great bass and tidy highs . A noticable difference from the twenty something dollar buds and therefore worth the price difference . I use these mainly for workouts at the gym and riding my motorbike . They fit well under the helmet as their " height " is minimal allowing the helmet to be put on without them getting pushed out of place . Can you please make them without dipping them in catnip please ?  
2	  It 's bigger and better than the one that I had before . What more could I ask for .  
1	  My title says it all . Opened the box , tried it , the CD player did not work at all .. returned it .  
2	  I was looking for some speakers to play with my IPod , and someone recommended the Panasonic Folding Travel Speakers ( RPSPT70 ) . Based on all of the reviews , i was confident that these speakers were what i was looking for , and i was right . The sound quality is amazaing . In one review , someone said that there is a humming noise on very low volume , but i did not notice this on my speakers . Also , some reviews said that the speakers come with an AC adaptor .. the ones bought off of Amazon do not . Pros : - Very compact-Excellent sound quality-Decent Bass-Good Volume-VERY VERY CHEAP ! Cons : - The cord is very short-The speaker 's stand is small , and they fall over is the cord is slightly pulled-the volume is controlled from the music player , and not the speakers . Overall these speakers have amazing sound quality for being so tiny , and cheap . Do not be skeptical in buying these . They are worth every Cent !  
1	  The package was received in good order and the battery looked like it should work in the our Bell South telephone Model 9926 , however the connection would not fit in the telephone , so we returned the battery and Amazon was very cooperative and paid for the return . We were very satisfied with Amazon . Al  
1	  Although this is a sleek camera full of ' extras ' , I couldn't get past the white spots that appeared when using the flash . For me , it was happening on well over 50 % of all photos taken with the flash , which is a deal-breaker . The white spots are so bad on most of the pictures that I am not even able to clean them up using Photoshop . I 'm really disappointed , because I loved many features the camera came with .  
1	  I bought this DVD player little over a year ago . For the year that I had it in use , it would occasionally freeze and was totally unresponsive to commands from the remote control or the buttons on the unit . The solution was once every couple of days or weeks you would have to pull the plug and then plug it in again so it would re-initialize . Then last week this all came to an end . The unit would not power on no matter what I did . Check the web and you will see it is a common defect with this machine . RCA should have recalled this POS , but instead insists its customers return the unit for [ price ] ! Not I. I have since bought the Pioneer CV 444 which is a superior unit and has a reputation for reliability , unlike this POS . RCA should have learned it lesson with its television power-pack problems and class action suit . Selling defective products and then having a " too bad " attitude when it is clear that there is a problem with the design of their products is hardly the way to build customer loyalty . I will never buy an RCA product again .  
2	  Simple to setup , and very simple to use . It provides a good & # 34 ; typing & # 34 ; angle , and it keeps the laptop cooler temperature wise . No user issues .  
2	  First off , fantastic sound . Very comfortable . Excellent isolation . The more I listen , the more I like them . If you don't mind paying more than the cost of some MP3 players for earbuds , you won't be disappointed . Of course , then there 's the E5c at $ 500 , but I could not bring myself to pay more than I did for my iPod , especially since I recently bought Altec Lansing 's outstandin inMotion speakers . As for running the cord behing your back , you don't have to ! This is not necessary . Yes , you loop the cords behind your ears , which by the way makes them stay in better , but you can still run the cord down the front , even though the instructions show it going down the back . It 's actually quite simple to do ! I can have mine in place in less than 5 seconds .  
2	  These headphones have good quality sound . I use them for jogging and there 's not too much to complain about there . They stay on well enough . My only complaint is that the band that goes behind the neck is not adjustable . Not a big deal in terms of function , but the band sticks out a bit in the back and looks a little goofy . All around pleased with the product , and would recommend it .  
2	  This lens was perfect on my XSI . This is the best upgrade to the kit lens . Very sharp .  
2	  I 've had GPS 's of various ilks for over ten years , and this is the best one yet . If you like bluetooth , but don't like them in your ear , this is the one for you . Your cell phone works seamlessly with this bluetooth , and it shows your complete cell phone book in it . If your cell phone is also voice dial capab le so is the bluetooth . IGood Unit , it boots quicker than any other I 've had and it refreshes very quickly . It isn't the fanciest on the market but it does most things and does them well .  
1	  This is the worst disappointment to discover that the picture frame , unlike most that we could have bought instead simply does not work without " activating " it . That is , you stick in your memory card , but then nothing happens , unless you subscribe to a service over internet , phone , whatever . This way you could activate a card reader that you have already paid for . This was not at all our intention when we purchased this product as the package makes no mention of such " bundling " . Now I am stuck with a gift that was returned to us from a grandmother , who could not make it work . Neither could I. I will try returning it to where we bought it and do my best to warn others about this rip off .  
1	  I have owned a dozen HP printers over the years and just bought a 460wf . The printer has been nothing but trouble . I am fairly computer literate and was unable to connect to the computer wirelessly following the basic instructions . After 6 hours with " customer service " I was able to get it set up and working . The tech support people ( the 6th group I spoke to ) said it was " faulty drivers " . 5 weeks later the problem returned . When I called to get a product return number I was told that it was too late to return the item . I then called customer service who told me that the warranty had expired ( false ) . The offshore customer support techs were basically automons who could not speak English . Unless your time has no value this customer support is WORTHLESS . This is the worst printer I have ever had ( not that it prints ) and the customer support is so bad I will NEVER buy HP again . Do yourself a favor and buy any other printer .  
1	  Quick heads up , I have three HD TV 's and the other two both get fantastic reception but this one gets nothing and even the SD channels are poor or didnt scan at all . High quality antennas did nothing to help the situation . I live near downtown in the nations third largest city and can see the broadcast antenna but that means nothing with this TV ! BTW if you are not standing dead in front of it forget it ! Regards , Get a Sony or Sammy  
1	  I tried all the workarounds and terminal setting patches described by other reviewers . None worked for me on either an iBook or PowerBook ( yes , the internal airport cards fail and are too expensive to replace ) . I wonder why it 's so hard for Belkin to write a driver for Macs .  
1	  this wireless keyboard does not stay connected to the RF transmitter ; it loses its connection after a couple of minutes - be it at 2 feet or 2 inches distance . there is no discernable pattern , yet the problem is consistent enough to render the keyboard entirely useless . on the positive side , kensington support was very helpful and replaced the keyboard with the 2.4GHz , flawlessly operating pilotboard 64390 . don't buy this one , get the 64390 instead .  
2	  Love my speakers . I use them with my computer and stream a radio station every day and they have great sound . With Bose you can't lose .  
1	  The sound is great , but they are tight . I stretched them out on a couch arm overnight , It just reverted to the original discomfort . I dont have huge ears , they dont cover your ear you have to like stick them in and that brings even more discomfort . When i spend more for headphones i expect 2 things comfort and quality sound .  
1	  I am quite disappointed that I was unable to set up this WMB54G bridge . I spent close to 4 hours on my own unsuccessfully trying to set up this bridge with my Linksys WRT54G router using both my desktop and my laptop . I contacted Linksys tech support and worked with a junior level rep for about an hour with no success . My second contact with Linksys Tech Support was the result of a follow-up call initiated by Linksys . I spoke with a Senior Tech who advised me that WMB54G compatibility with XP Service Pack 3 could be problematic . I then relinquished control of my computer to another Linksys tech that specialized in the WMB54G . The tech took over control of my computer for 45 minutes to an hour trying unsuccessfully to setup the bridge . After updating theLinksys WMB54G Wireless-G Music Bridgefirmware he was unable to continue to access the bridge web based setup page . At that point he considered the bridge defective and offered to provide an RMA for a free replacement . Because of other poor reviews and possible compatibility issues with XP SP3 , I have decided to cut my losses ( only $ 25.00 ) and return the bridge for whatever refund I can get . Even though they were not successful I give very high marks to the second level Linksys support for their follow-up and trouble shooting . The senor technician ( Rico ) that worked with me thoroughly knew the music bridge and wireless technology .  
2	  The sound is really good on these , no high-pitched buzz like on my previous Sennheiser which only lasted 18 months . These are also very comfortable to wear . Strangely , the reception is better in certain locations of the house than others ; distance doesn't appear the factor but doors are . If these headphones last longer than 18 months , I will definitely recommend them . UPDATE5 years later .. I 'm still enjoying my headphones ! I 've replaced the batteries a couple of times only even though I use these at least 5 times a week , watching TV or listening to music , at times while gardening or doing house chores . The ear covers actually cup the ear and have a more secure fit than the Sennheiser RS 120 which my husband subsequently purchased . Like most other headphones , there is a bit of a hiss which I stopped noticing long ago . Every now and then , the hiss gets louder and all I need to do , is unplug the base from my receiver and plug it right back in and the hiss is gone . Very happy with this purchase .  
2	  A good headset for the price . I bought this headset for occasional use . Quality seems good and it 's comfortable . My only complaint is the sound is a little muted . If you have bad hearing it could be an issue or maybe turn up phone volume when using it .  
1	  The WRV56G router & wireless features perform much like every other Linksys product that I have been happy with . However I purchased this item to setup a VPN and it has been nothing but problems . It was much easier to setup a VPN using Windows Server at my office then to do it with this " simple " router at home . Even using Linksys ' QuickVPN is a waste of time since it is such a flaky and featureless program . Sometimes it connects sometimes it doesn't , no rhyme or reason . I will be returning this router . Linksys should pull this item from the market to prevent further damage to their otherwise good reputation . Come on Cisco ( Linksys ' parent company ) you are the worlds leading manufacturer of networking how did you let this product out of QA ? I am extremely disappointed .  
1	  It seems to work ok , but the peg in the back of the wall-mount isn't far enough down . It makes the bottom of the plug stick out so it isn't flush with the wall . I will have to see if my husband can remove that when he gets home . Otherwise , it works just fine .  
1	  1 ) that in just a couple years , the battery wouldn't hold a charge and die in 45 min . and you can't change the battery2 ) the paperclip ( not supplied but don't leave home with out it ) Every owner now knows about the papercplip to reset and has one hid someplace . I gave it a rating of 2 because it held all the music i wanted , the shuffle play worked well , and was a nice music selection away from home . I now wish I had went main stream and spent the couple extra dollars and bought the Ipod at the first . i won't send mine to the landfill just yet , but as soon as it quits working on 110 , c'est la vie ..  
1	  This thing is horrible , and I am returning mine tomorrow . Picture quality is absolutely pathetic . I 've seen better pictures from camera-phones . In bright light , with no motion , with everyone holding their breath , you may be able to get an acceptably sharp picture . At any other time forget it . With decreasing light and increasing amounts of motion , picture quality degrades to a featureless blur of colors . I checked , double-checked , and re-checked to make sure that I wasn't missing something obvious ( I wasn't ) . In addition to this overarching complaint , I have to say that the camera body is flimsy , and feels cheap . Unlike the solid metal you find on , say , a Canon Powershot , this one is plastic . The cover for the battery station is made of the same cheap plastic , and feels as if it could break off after a moderate amount of use . This is exacerbated by the fact that it takes 4 AA batteries which must be removed for replacement or recharging . Battery life with standard Alkaline batteries was abysmal - after 20 shots the " check battery " indicator was already flashing . I never got around to checking the bundled software . After 1 bungled gymnastics meet it was clear that this was not the camera for me . The preview LCD is very large , sharp , and clear . In fact , pictures look better on it than they do at full size . Printed documentation is minimal . To learn about all of the settings , you must consult the soft-copy " Advanced " guide on the included CD .  
2	  The router works great and is easy to set up . Very nice utilization of Dyn DNS for assigning different FQDNs per external interface . The " but .. " part is the VPN - I still havnt gotten it to work yet . Guess Im actually going to have to read something other than the provided docs on this one .. Great product though - totally happy w it !  
1	  I can't say anything bad about the picture quality but autoprogramming the channels was a nightmare . Apparently I must have gotten a bad model because I haven't read anything about anyone else having a problem with the autoprogramming . When I started the autoprogramming to scan for all the channels it ran just fine at first . It loaded the channel numbers and then it started going through and loading the digital channels . The progress bar got to 84 % and then froze . Ten hours later it was still frozen . I couldn't exit out of the autoprogramming mode so I simply had to turn the tv off . When I turned the tv back on I could pick up 10 stations , all analog . I ran the autoprogramming again and it got stuck at 84 % completion again . This time I turned it off immediately and when I turned it back on I could pick about 40 stations . That still wasn't enough and besides , the digital stations were still missing . I ran it a third time and was only able to pick up 20 stations . It didn't matter how long I left the tv on when it got stuck at the 84 % mark . The number of stations the tv could pick up was totally random . I thought maybe it was my cable service but that tested out okay . Finally I thought I wonder what would happen if I turned the tv off before it got to the 84 % completion mark ? I started the autoprogramming , once again , and as soon as it got to 83 % I turned off the tv . I turned the tv back on and lo and behold all the stations were there , even the digital ones . I 'm thinking there 's a software error in the chip that runs the autoprogramming . When the autoprogramming reaches the 84 % mark it apparently gets stuck in an endless loop and is unable to complete the autoprogramming automatically .  
1	  This was a recommended accessory for the Garmin model Nuvi # 200 , but it does work and I need to return it .  
2	  I have been real happy with this TV . The picture is outstanding when you have a good HDTV signal , and very good even with a standard resolution signal . Football games are great . This TV is plenty big enough for my room , but I find myself wishing that I had sprung for the the 50 " Panasonic plasma .

1	  picked up two sets in liquidation for a big $ 20 each , and while they are pretty much as bad as decribed elsewhere , I will probably find some use in the future , such as the deck . I would be royally p 'd off if I had purchased them at retail price . My own main issue with them is that they are entirely unsuitable for an iPod : Whenever the audio signal goes off - such as after a playlist ends - the emitter stops broadcasting after a brief delay . Then all hell breaks loose as the speakers emit a loud chirp-and-screech noise , on and off . A nice way to wake up in the middle of they nigh , if you like to fall alseep to some music ..  
1	  This was a great mouse for the 4 months that it work correctly . The scroll wheel just went out . So much for the " Revolutionary hyper-fast scroll wheel " We will see how the warranty goes ..  
2	  I 'm considering having my old ipod fixed . It was great for a few years .  
1	  I bought this printer because I have always been satisfied with previous HP printers that I have owned . However , this one was a mess from the start . I can live with the fact that it prints slowly and the scans are very poor . However , from week # 2 this printer started getting paper jams errors and out of paper errors when the tray was full of HP all in one paper . The paper feed often pulls gobs of paper at a time unless you only put about six sheets of paper in the tray at a time . I have called HP customer support but they are of absolutely no use . Since the printer was only days old I wanted it replaced . Instead they insisted on " troubleshooting " the problem . I have complained four times and insisted on a new printer . However , they insist on " troubleshooting " the problem . The problem is that I have a defective printer and want it replaced . HP has outsourced their customer support to India so you cannot get anything out of them other than what they are reading on their computer screens . It is like talking to a robot with a bad accent . My advice : Stay away from HP printers altogether .  
2	  ProsI have Windows XP and had no problem installing the Quickcam . The It workes as described . I have been using it in conjunction with Skype for 4 week and I am enjoying my grandchildren . Cons .. None  
2	  This memory made me a bit Queasy at first when I clicked BUY . Well , Lets just say i run many windows , many programs , and still have time for gaming . ITS MY video Card that is the culprit ..  
2	  Does everything I bought it for - runs without issue on Windows Vista and the Polar sync software I use with my S625X watch . NOTE FOR VISTA USERS : Vista won't automatically find the driver over the internet . You need to use the CD that comes with the adapter , and point it towards the folder with the Windows XP driver . After approving the driver for installation , it should work fine .  
2	  I really like this camera , but I 'm dropping my evaluation to only 3-stars . It is lightweight and fits easily in a pocket or purse . The menus are intuitive , and the quality of the pictures taken is much better than anything I 've seen from point-'n'-shoot cameras in the past . I even plugged it into my 42 " television and projected the pictures I took in that format . I was amazed the even when blowing the image up to that size I still did not get any distoration or pixel loss . The one problem I have had is that for some reason it quit working about a month after I got it . And that is why it only got 4-stars . The lens all of a sudden refused to retract when I turned the camera off . And when I turned it on , the message I got was to turn it off and turn it back on again . That process cycled over and over . The camera is in the shop now . [ EDIT - Jan 2 , 2009 ] Well , I got it baack from the shop and took it on vacation with me in early November 2008 . The camera functioned properly , and produced some exceptional pictures , mostly from a moving vehicle , since I was using my SLR when out of the car . Then , after returning home , it failed again in mid-December , for no particular reason . It hasn't been dropped or abused in any way . It just quit , so now I 'm looking at another repair . Warrantee or not , the postage costs me money , not to mention the time it takes for repair , during which I don't have a small camera at my side . Eval dropped to 3-stars ! Opps , I mean *  
1	  I have bought this router a month ago ( july 03 ) from amazon . The current version is version 4 . It is horrible . My biggest problem with it is that itconstantly DROPS connections . Any file larger than severalmegs is dropped half way through . Same for big web pages . Open terminals die after 2 minutes of disuse , etc , etc , etcBut , hey - dont take my word for it , read " hundreds of others .. > Oh , and their tech support is utterly knowledgeless . Keep away .  
1	  Sigh ! This is just the kind product I wanted , and it did everything well . If yours keeps working , I think you 'll be very happy . But mine abruptly stopped working after three months and two weeks-just two weeks past the warranty expired ! ( Mine is RCA factory refurbished ) . Avoid an expensive mistake . Buy a more reliable product .  
2	  Works great for getting a laptop , files and a short trips ' clothes in one convenient package . I usually carry alot of paperwork / files to go with my laptop and this case has some serious room . It is heavy and coupled with a 17 " laptop is very heavy but the wheels work fine and the shoulder strap works good as well . Nice low key look that does not attract attention screeming , " hey there 's a laptop in here , steal me ! " This was bought to replace a very expensive LowePro backpack that had massive zipper failure because of being overloaded . The new Targus case is not even remotely close to being full with the same amount of gear . It still looks empty as a matter of fact . Decided to go back to Targus after the Lowepro because of a very positive experience with a Targus laptop backpack with a 15 " computer . Seems most of my gear failures are b / c of overpacking and the zippers busting so this case should aleviate that problem ! The mediocre rating scared me but the 2 1-star ratings were one instance of a damaged product ( understandable ) and the other was from someone claiming the laptop would not fit but evidently did not realize there is an adjustable petition in the laptop compartment ! I measured the dimensions that targus spec 'd and they are accurate . I measured the reviewers dimensions and the laptop would fit easily in this case as my 17 " dell is much larger and fits ; once the velcro partition is adjusted .  
2	  Over all this product is very nice It does work as stated as long as you have a high speed conection . BUT check to see if it 's compatiable with your tv , cable box , fta receiver , etc . The on screen remote control that is used in the slingbox software did not support my equiptment . Although tech support was very fast to reach , and in enghish I must add they were very aware of incompatable remote issues . With no resolve . I had to search out a third party remote program to resolve my issue . But it did not control all the functions of my origanal remote but did the job .  
1	  The DX6340 does take excellent pictures . As with most digital cameras there is an annoying delay between pressing the shutter release and the actual picture " event " , but unless you spend a lot more money , it 's something you live with when you go digital . Plenty of options for the price . Again , no qualms with the photo quality . The body of the camera , however , is not reliable . The automatic lens " door " that opens when you turn on the camera frequently gets stuck and the battery door broke after a year and a half . To replace that part you 'd have to replace the entire body of the camera . This also happened to a family member who has a Kodak . If this happens , buy silver duct tape .. at least it matches the camera color . The software is very touchy and locks up frequently and will sometimes require an entire PC reboot . I would not buy Kodak Easyshare again unless those three problems are resolved .  
1	  This is my 3rd pair of Sony headphones , I have always been a fan of Sony , I 've had the MDR V150 & the MDR V6 and loved them . But . . . there 's hardly no bass response with these XD100 's . They fit comfortably and mids & highs sound nice but NO BASS . I 'm very disappointed with these headphones and considering trying a new manufacturer .  
1	  I bought this tripod several years ago but have only used it a FEW times for special circumstances . I was planning to snap photos of a lunar eclipse last night only to have 3 of the leg clamps break off tiny pieces at the hinges rendering it useless . I was utterly shocked . I had really been pleased with this tripod up until that happened . Upon reading other reviews , I discovered that this is a common occurrence . I bought it on a whim while in a photo supply store . Next time I will be researching first . I warn other potential buyers to do the same .  
2	  I have very happy with the system since I paid only $ 13 for it Thanks to dealsofamerica . com for posting the deal and thanks to amazon . com to shipping it to me . Very good 5.1 speaker system that works even with my ipod too .  
1	  I was able to play only one of five DVDs I made on this machine . When recording from an attached video camera , everything looked fine , picture appeared on TV going through the DVD / VCR , Record light is nicely lit , after finishing the DVD it played well on the Samsung . But when trying to play back either on my Sony Vaio or my Apple iMac , all I get is a soundless black picture . When I recorded on DVD-RW from a videotape inserted in the VCR , I could play the result on my Sony . But the next tape I recorded only caused Microsoft to keep asking me to send an error report when I tried to play it on my Sony . My Apple refused to recognize it as a DVD . Unpredictably incompatible . When I called the Samsung helpdesk they told me to call the computer manufacturer . I guess I would have to call both Sony and Apple then ? Crutchfield was the seller for this product and they actually have a very helpful helpdesk - by the name of Darren - According to him I should try a different brand DVD disc . I tried Memorex instead of the Office Depot and found that this brand of disc solved the problem . Question for Samsung : Why don't you have this on your troubleshooting page in the manual ? Why does the dealer know this , but you don't ?  
1	  Even with the tracking adjustment , the tapeplayer wouldn't produce a sharp picture . The best I could do on picture quality was still unwatchable .  
1	  I have been considering buying this drive for a few weeks now and was about ready to pull the trigger when I read the reviews . After all the research I 've done this is the first I 've heard that this is actually 2 250MB drives in a RAID 0 . It is totally unacceptable that LaCie does not disclose this fact . I won't bore you with the details but RAID 0 increases your chances of losing data .  
2	  I have owned many computers over the years , ranging from E-machine , apple , hp , Dell , Compaq .. and I buy new PCs every 2 years because I don't like to mess with all the up-grades .. This is my first Sony PC and I LOVE IT ! What first attracted me to this computer is its ability to play / record tv and view them later called & # 34 ; giga pocket & # 34 ; , dvd burner / and you can fold up the keyboard when you are not using it , giving more space on your desk . if you just want to watch tv / then the keyboard can be folded in half so your PC looks like a TV . this is Sony 's first computer with a Plasma screen ! this is the same as Sony 's Plasma TVS ( i was told that by a SONY REP ) this has built in speakers that has an excellent sound ! I watch DVDs on this all the TIME ! this is also one of the few computers that is a dvd burner ! you can burn dvds , transfer your home videos onto a dvd .. some computers you can only watch dvds / not this ! this PC takes everything to the next level ! I also liked the sleek design of this PC , very SONY & # 60 ; This Pc is just awesome to do all sorts of things ! When I bought this Pc it was one of their newer series and had a hefty price tag on it but i was willing to pay that for a nice packaged PC with fast proccessor and lots of memory . this has a memory stick slot to expand your memory or if you saved something on a stick from your pda or anyother devise , you can view it .. this also came with a free LAN card which is $ 90.00 reatail . You don't have to mess with tons of wires ! yay ! If you are in the market for a new Pc that is fun , sleek , and fast then get this Pc . I have had mine now for 4 months and I love it . I have not had any problems , and I can do MULTI tasking without slowing any of my programs down .. The only thing I was little dissapointed with was the extra ( bundled ) softwares ( programs ) this PC came with .. they are all just basic , if you want the fuller / better version you have to download and pay extra .. that stinks . overall I am loving this new sleek , pretty , fast Vaio ! YAY FOR SONY !  
1	  I 'm on line trying to find a replacement for our now-discontinued V-2800 tripod . The crank broke after limited use .  
1	  To reiterate what the others are saying , this hub is unusable due to the high-pitched noise it emits .  
2	  I have actually ordered 4 of these . 1 for by the bed , 1 in the living room , 1 for work and 1 for the car . They all work great .  
1	  The ink pack would not print the color blue so the pictures looked like crap . I tried cleaning and aligning the ink nozzles and nothing worked .  
1	  It 's not what it is described ! It was very hard to stick the protector to the screen . It 's not really anti-glare . With the protector , the Image & text on the screen are not sharp . I try to return this item to BoxWave , but found that " Any ClearTouch products with its plastic backing sheets removed or re-attached at any time are not returnable " ( [ .. ] ) Don't waste money on this product ! ps : this is the first time I try to return a product bought from Amazon .  
2	  This product connected without any issues , and I now have my gaming desktop computer attached to a 37 " TV . I can't believe I used to play on a 20 incher , and was happy with it . This cable is a little shorter than I would like , but I will certainly live with it . Great quality , and still works flawlessly after 2 years of use .  
1	  Does not compare to Toshiba HD-XA2 for Upconversion . Blu-Ray may be fine but nothing compares to the Toshiba HD-XA2 for Upconversion that is out there on the market .  
1	  I bought this to add a couple extra USB outlets to my new Toshiba Laptop .. It will not plug n enough to connect in the slot .. Do not buy if you have a new laptop as it will not go far enough into the slot to make connections .. I am a computer tech who builds systems and networks , not a computer beginner .  
2	  I now own three sets of these - what more can I say ? One is in the office , one in the bedroom and one in the family room . I have a Zen Sleek that I connect up and they sound great ! Being a casual music listener , I was not looking for high end speakers and these fit the bill for delivering quality sound .  
2	  I originally purchased the D-Link equivalent and was very disappointed . I moved to the Netgear and I 'm very satisfied up to this point . Once connected , everything ( using the default configuration ) worked like a champ ; all computers and other wireless devices could access the Internet , and the DHCP was already working . I created the necessary drive maps and began to fiddle with the other configuration settings . The first things I noticed that pleased me were that the web interface was very well designed and settings I changed took effect immediately ( such as changing the password ) - this may not sound like a big deal , but that wasn't true for the D-Link equivalent . It is always nice knowing that you are working under the configuration you have set , and not having to wonder if they 've taken effect . Many of the network settings also took effect without having to reboot , which was also nice . Then I logged in and the router offered to search for updated firmware , I said " yes " , it found one , displayed information about it , and installed right from the router-easy as pie . I configured the security , and everything was working great ! I was also especially pleased with the little stand that came with the router , allowing it to stand upright and keep out of the way of other devices . I noticed on my wireless devices throughout the house the the signal seemed to be stronger and more reliable that with the other router I had . Note : I haven't yet tried to use the Super G 108Mbs functionality .  
1	  Buyers be aware . I purchased this Nikon 4300 based on online reviews . This is the worst purchase I ever made . The camera is poorly designed . Besides minor irritations like the lens cap and battery recharge , the camera 's other major operating functins are not even up to the standard of normal use . I used a 256MB Compact flash card . After taking dozens of pictures , it became painfully slow ( longer than 5 sec ) to write the data into memory card . You will for sure miss many great photo opportunities . The worst is when you need to delete any pictures . After many shots , each deletion will take over 10 minutes to complete ( no typo here ) . Are you kidding me , Nikon people ? I can't believe Nikon is even selling this product . You may wonder maybe this is a rare case of defect , but no , this is already the second replacement from factory . Both cameras are having the same problems . The camera must have used a very outdated processor and is extremely slow . When you need to review the photos in the camera , you can feel how slow the pictures are displayed . The irritations are just too much to bear . Now I am really skeptical at what I read online . Most are marketing ploy , not to be trusted .  
1	  I bought this camera specifically for the zoom capability . That was fine . Pictures are clear . The trouble with this camera is the On and OFF switch . Sometimes it works .. sometimes not . Higher altitude at times cause the problem but even at 200 feet above sealevel it doesn't work . The film has gotten caught up at times and won't auto rewind or wind with new film . I say buy a camera that you know is reliable . I since have bought a Canon Sure Shot 115 and very happy .. plus its cheaper .  
2	  I grew up with a big base scanner . This one is one eighth the size and picks up so much more . I programmed in over 50 local frequencies from the Internet and the scan features flies through them , so you don't miss much . The manual may seem a little intimidating but once you know the basics , the scanner will be easy to operate . Some of the transmissions cut off and on periodically but I live out in the boonies , so that may have something to do with it . I live in an area that is susceptible to brush fires and floods , so this will come in handy . Quick delivery too , by the way . Thank you , Amazon .  
2	  I enjoyed listening to this head phone through my ipod . I could hear all the small detail , and the quality of the wires also looks very good . When used properly the head phone provides a nice noise isolation . I 'm only concerned about the plug as it is not ninety degree there is chance that it will break . I have only had this headphone for a week , and I 'm loving it so far .  
1	  I recived my sub put it on the X-over and pushed play it was ok . there was an air leak the front plexiglass isn't level and speaker died at 10 watts with no clpping Amazon sending replacement will update when it arrives . second box was the same quality the speaker also cannot take anywhere near even 100 watts crap is best word for this item .  
1	  I 've owned multiple Palm devices and , with the exception of the oldest technology , have ended up with problems will all of them and found at times that they were limited in their ability to do the things I wanted . So , I eventually decided to move to a Pocket PC . After reading some reviews , I came across the Toshiba Pocket PC e740 which was leading edge technology at the time . Unfortunately , the reviwers who point out that the design of this device is less than perfect are absolutely correct . This is especially true of button positions and battery life . Data loss due to the record button or on button being inadvertantly pressed for long periods of time while in an airline overhead bin is becoming common for me . Smarter button positioning would easily eliminate this problem . I 've also noticed the batteries drain remarkably quickly , allowing for only an hour or so of work before they need recharging . This is hardly useful on a 7 hour flight over the Atlantic . If you travel a lot , I 'd look to other devices which have better design and better battery life .  
1	  Too bad for me that the warranty expires after six ! The product has a defect that tech support admitted to , but I got absolutely no help , mercy or customer service from the Panasonic company . They demanded one third of its original price for me to send it to Texas to have it fixed ! After YEARS of buying Panasonic products , they just lost another customer .  
1	  Linksys has failed to honor two rebates from me and no doubt countless others . Don't buy Linksys ! They are lying cheating SOB 's  
1	  This is one of the worst monitors I 've ever encountered . It is very blurry . It turned itself off then reappeared with the most horrible blurry screen I 've ever seen ! I rebooted my machine and it returned to normal .. only to do it again 20 minutes later ! STAY AWAY FROM THIS MONITOR ! I am a computer professional .. I have seen many monitors .. this is by far the WORST . ALSO take not its not flat at all .. Viewsonice put a flat piece of glass in front of the CURVED tube to FOOL you !  
1	  You 'll print great documents and photos , but don't count on Epson printers to last long . The Stylus CX4600 was my third Epson printer and it lasted only 6 months . The reoccurring problem with Epson printers are the heads clogging . If you do decide to purchase this printer buy the insurance , but better yet buy a different printer .  
1	  The cord did not fit the product . Had to return product due to this . Was a christmas present so did present a problem .  
2	  This 4800 is of finest quality , well engineered , light , controls are well placed , and the pictures are simply AWESUME !  
2	  These are good , i have k271mkII and k-240 and Sennheiser 518 and many small ones , the K 240 has better bass and and 518 is much better , but little compromising on the rest . The 271 is awesome on everything except the lows , i mean if you are a rock and roll and classic guy these will be good , but if you are a sort of a person who wants a little more bass bang the 240 are good , and the Sennheiser 518 sound completely different they are good too , but i find the 271 more crisp and clear . And ya they are made in China which kind of ruins the whole wow part , they are comfortable , i like the detachable cable part .  
1	  When the drive is working , it is so slow as to be almost unusable . I spent hours combing through the WD knowledge base and could find nothing to help . Worse , after a few days the Mionet program started throwing an error that says it cannot get my username , and then refuses to open . I emailed WD tech support and 2 emails and 3 days later they still haven't responded . Now all of my data is inaccessible , the knowledge base has no entry for this error , and tech support won't respond . Purchase this product at your own risk . I 'll be returning mine as soon as I find a way to get my data off of it .  
2	  I THINK THIS IS A WONDERFUL VIEWCAM BUT YOU SHOULD OFFER A FREE DOWNLOAD OF THIS ITEM , LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER MODELS ! I HAVE LOST MY OWN !  
2	  This keyb is great . With this , and Documents To Go , the handheld is a great laptop replacement handling most wordprocessing and simple spreadsheet applications with ease . The keyb is small , light , and comfortable . The cool factor is very high the way it opens up . And , yes , you do get second glances when sitting in the coffee shop and writing your latest novel . Works really well with the Sony PDAs with 16 Mb ram in them .. makes it convenient to store all those documents .  
1	  Horrible , horrible product . had it for one year , and then it died . it was hell to finally get all my files out of it onto another working drive . i have a friend that also bought it . has had it for one year . and it died yesterday . stay far , far away from this product .  
1	  When my ipod crapped out I bought a SanDisk Sansa and the Griffin itrip Universal FM transmitter because I wanted to listed to MP3s in the car . But the itrip turns off every 30 seconds or so , and you have to fiddle around with it to get it to turn back on ( which is pretty dangerous when driving ) , to just have it turn off again 30 seconds later . And driving over 30mph the sound quality decreases dramatically , to the point of just static . My return window is over , so I 'm not sure how I 'm going to resolve this issue .  
2	  Not a great deal to say , as they are described and supplied as they look . They are suitable for plugging in stereo RCA to headphones / computer .. No complaints here .  
2	  I bought this wallet for my Palm IIxe . It is excellent . My palm pilot fits perfectly . The battery holders work great for a stylus . I use it as a regular wallet . The only problem is if you hold your cash in it , there is no place for change and you have to fold your bills . The wallet is a great buy for its price . It is made of genuine leather . It provides great protection for your handheld . It is a large wallet but not too large . It is not wise to put it in your back pocket but you can squeeze it into a side pocket or it fits perfectly into a cargo pocket . I recommend this to anyone who wants a good looking wallet fo their PDA .  
1	  The product is defective .. The keys wear out within a couple of months and looks awful . I bought a second one thinking it was just a quirk but I was wrong , the second one was just as bad . This product costs too much to buy one per month . Save your money buy another brand ..  
1	  Did not pick up more than five channels in my home . Probably due to how far I live from the broadcasting stations .  
2	  This is a great docking station , and nice little boombox . The sound might not be the most epic , but for the price it can't be beat . In comparison to other iPod speaker systems a great deal for the sound it does put out . Our family has four iPods , and absolutely love the convenience this radio offers . We have two of these units now , a blue one and a pink one , and never regretted out decision , not for a minute . If your looking for an economical and inexpensive charging / speaker system , look no further . Not only that , but its stylish , and keeps the iPod protected while docked , which most docks do not do . What more can you ask for ? Maybe better sound quality , but your not going to get that for this price point .  
1	  I was looking for a new charger set for my iPhone . This set simply did not work . - The 12v vehicle adapter was loose and came unplugged very easily-The fuse ended up shorting out , sparking and catching on fire in my vehicle , melting the 12v adapter-The AC plug / wall adpater would not continue charging once the phone entered sleep modeBuy a better quality unit , do not waste your money  
1	  A great idea in developing what most serious gym rats long for : wirefree gadetry on the move and mp3 technology at our finger tips : plus being the first one in my gym with this new gadetry .. major bonus point . need improving : headsets cannot withstand sweat , which happens during a hard workout .. buring out one side or fading sound . Another problem encountered was a reduction of my allowed 64mb memory to 60.5mb .. even after deleting old file .. PLEASE REFRAIN FROM PURCHASING UNTIL IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE ..  
1	  Purchased this percolator after reading all the positive reviews . I 've been using Farberware for as long as I can remember , but in the last few years they don't last very long , and got tired of getting / returning them every 4-6 months . The Presto is even worse than the Farberware ! The coffee was weak and cold ! Do these companies realize that their products are not what they used to be ? They are charging the same prices but the products are substandard . Why do they continue to make them in China ? I will have to start using a stove top percolator again .  
2	  These headphones are truly fantastic . They have amazing sound quality and are downright dirt cheap . The only two downsides are that they leak some sound ( meaning others around you can hear what you are listening to , to a degree ) , and hair gets caught in the headband . Otherwise , they are frankly a miracle of headphone technology . When I bought them I didn't really think they would have very good sound quality because they are so cheap , but I was thankfully mistaken . If you have only ever used your freebee white earbuds that come with your iPod , you need to buy these headphones now ! You will be astonished how much a good pair of headphones changes music .  
2	  Despite the comments by one , everyone loves thier player . I take mine everywhere . It has never skipped ( Even when I drop it ! Oops ! ) , and the finish is still there . I have had it for a year , and still haven't had to change the batteries . All of it 's functions are great ! Plus , it gives off great sound ! It 's size is also fantastic . In most of my pants , it can actually fit in the pockets . The headphones aren't the greatest , but who cares ? This is the best you can get for your money .  
2	  I used to own little crappy Dell speakers that came with the computer stock . I had them for a couple years . I finally decided to muster up some money ( I 'm a college student , so I 'm automatically broke ) , and decided to invest in some 2.1 speakers , since 5.1 was a little bit more of an investment , and I didn't feel that I was ready for it anyway . Let me tell you .. these speakers bring life to the whole room . Your day will be made as soon as you crank these puppies up . And for less than 40 bux .. how can that not be a steal ? And don't even let me start on the videogames .. haha !  
2	  mostly everything about this wireless headset for TV is as advertised EXCEPT that when I received it they now say that you need to buy new earpiece covers and change them every few weeks . they should have included silicone earpieces with the unit instead of , or in addition to the cheap foam rubber ones that come with the unit .  
2	  The keyboard is definitely used , the arrow and shift keys stick a little at times , but it 's still in really good condition . I 'm especially happy with the price . And now I have my Mac shortcuts back . This is much better than using a Mac with a PC keyboard .  
2	  Product was fabulous , shipping was prompt , they even included a short , sweet handwritten note on the packing slip wishing me the best pictures ! It was inexpensive , a great item and I couldn't be happier with my purchase .  
2	  This is the best Christmas present I could have bought for myself . It arrived in 3 days . I had purchased the armband and in-ear headphones . It was easy to set-up and iTunes is very user friendly . Synching up songs went well , even though I don't have USB 2.0 the speed to me is acceptable . The only minor thing is I didn't like the earphones that come with it . When I was working out they would often fall out . The sound seemed a bit tinny as well . Buy the in-ear buds and you 'll be set . I jog , lift weights at use it at the gym with no problems or skipping . It is so small it fits in the palm of your hand . No worries about tangled headphone cords and fits easily into my gym bag . Highly recommended .  
1	  I own this router along with the D-Link WAU-2340 wireless adapter for less than one year . About 6 months ago the adapter stopped working . I dealt with folks on the west coast and had a new unit shipped to me although I had to send back the damaged one at my cost ( fed ex ) . It just stopped working again and I have been on the phone for more than 2 hours with folks from India . Not to be biased as I have had great success with Indian customer service for other products but these folks were rude , impatient and annoying . One actually hung up on me . They are telling you to do things at breakneck speed while you 're trying to understand what they 're saying . If you forget one thing they get annoyed and say things line " What did I tell you a moment ago - you weren't listening " with the attitude of a teenager . They want to get you off the phone asap so they tell you to do something then call them back ( which had me on hold for up to 30 minutes - 2 times ) If this is customer service its not what we are accustomed to in the US . SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET A LINKSYS  
1	  How can a company that has historically made so many great products make such a total piece of junk ? I have had this CD recorder for a year and a half . It is currently at a repair shop in the hope that they can fix the CD loading tray from constantly jamming and eating CDs . I 'm not holding my breath because the folks at Pioneer are totally uncooperative about fixing the problem . I may have to throw away this [ $ ] piece of , ahem , equipment because it simply won't work and I can't get it fixed . Whatever you do , don't buy a Pioneer CD player or recorder . If you 're like me , you 've had many other good Pioneer products and might be tempted to buy something like this from them . If you do , you 'll regret it . Run away as fast as you can .  
2	  I needed a second computer for my home office and I also wanted a flat panel TV for general news and weather information . This computer fit the bill perfectly . It is powerful enough to do anything that I ask it to do and the set up was a breeze . I spent hours reading tech reviews about computers and monitors , but this was perfect . I don't have a digital or HD signal running to the monitor ( I purchased a 22 " ViewSonic VX2235wp ) , but the picture is good and there is no lag or problems when I switch channels . All games and DVDs play and look great to a 34 year old who plays a few games a year . The best part is the value that you get with wireless internet connections and wireless keyboard and mouse . Great buy .  
2	  I had one of these where I worked and it 's now great to have one for play . I love the size of the body and the quality of the images . I recommend this to any amateur looking to step it up .  
2	  I bought this to hook up stuff to a new FIOS connection where the house has Ethernet connections throughout . It works - nothing more need be said . I don't remember whether this went to the WD Live or is used with the wireless modem ( used for the Galaxy S3 to bypass the data plan ) . It works great .  
2	  Long chapters , long book , lots of unresolved threads - how brave , how brilliant of Knopf and Tartt to dare to offer this story . Tartt is among the best contemporary writers I have read . I can't believe I have missed The Secret History and can't wait to read it . I don't care what the story is - the woman doesn't simply write , she composes . The way she puts words together reaches deep inside of me - like listening to a Beethoven symphony . I too , am baffled by all of the negative reviews .  
2	  The adapter works great . I would not give it a second thought to buying another one from your right again .  
1	  Theoretically this is a great product . All the good stuff that has been said is pretty much true . However .. The first one I bought lasted about 6 months . Then , it just quit playing dvd 's , cd 's . So I bought another one . August 30,2008 . November 1 , 2008 it simply doesn't even play any kind of disk . Bought it brand new . 2 in a row ? Maybe I should change the title to Reliable - you may rely on it to crash . Fortunately , I bought a 2-year replacement plan ( after the product 's 1-year warranty ) . Wish me luck . Amazon 's customer service , by the way , has always been top-notch .  
1	  I ordered this product and was sent the Zeikos card reader in black instead . I ordered two and the company taped them together with packaging tape . I now have two very sticky card readers to throw in the trash . I would not order anything from this company .  
2	  a lot of people say that it doesnt work , but i had to see for my self and it really works good . just dont use to much water when you spray your cd before you use the repair  
2	  Cool retro design . The case does secure the entire camera , but tough to handle if you don't have it on your belt .  
1	  Let me start by saying I 've been a WD fan for several years , and have had excellent luck with their internal drives . I suspect that the disk drives in My Books are fine also . My first My Book wouldn't even power on no matter what I did . This occurred after about 2 months . Today the Fire Wire interface on my second My Book quit working . Luckily the USB interface still works . 45 minutes with support trying to get my warranty straightened our didn't help my confidence level with this company . I agree that having a $ 320.00 hold put on a credit card for a $ 150 device is ridiculous . I bought this device to back up my data , but I no longer have faith that if I need them my files will be there .  
2	  I bought and tried several higher-priced , name-brand competitors headphones to hear which ones actually cancelled out background noise . If you buy , try and compare you have a better chance of getting what you expect . The others that I tried had NO DISCERNABLE noise cancellation and / or , did not have sufficient volume for use within an airplane cabin . While this one lacks an auto-off switch , which can save batteries , and has no remote volume control , it works great at noise cancellation . I wouldn't argue that it has audiophile fidelity , but if you want to watch a movie on your computer , this makes it possible .  
2	  I purchased this product for a gift for someone else , but also received one as a gift myself , from Amazon , so I will do a review . This is a marvelous innovation in video . The Flip Video is easy to hold , operate and small enough to fit into a pocket . The videos come out crisp and clear and the sound is marvelous . I remember years ago , video taping was a bulky , heavy job , but no longer . The Flip Video makes it a breeze . The USB connection on the Flip Video plugs right into the computer to download videos and the cable connects the Flip Video to your TV to watch home videos in full screen color . Also , it does not require expensive batteries . I 'm very impressed by this Digital Technologies camcorder . It 's a great product .  
1	  One of these units started shocking us on our hands when in use ! We had to junk them , because that just isn't acceptable .  
2	  This product was great and had no problems . I was having trouble with a cheap optical cord that I had given to me a while back so it was time to get another one . I have no problems from this item and it gets the job done !  
1	  Item was received in factory sealed undamaged box but when opened it was discovered to have a defective cassette door , Item returned for refund . Refund postage was disallowed even though I was assured that it would be refunded . P. Graygray  
1	  My boss and I both purchased this keyboard about 5 months ago and I am already on here shopping for a new keyboard .. I loved the design of this keyboard and have enjoyed using it , but some of the keys have quit working for no apparent reason .. We popped the keys off to see if something had fallen under the key and to see if something had been spilt on it , but nothing was apparent .. My boss has also had problems with hers .. After about 3 months of use the lettering on the keys started wearing off .. To sum up , the design of the keyboard is awesome , but the quality of this product is pathetic ..  
1	  I own this thing for a year . After first 3 mo of usage it stopped hotsynching . Well , my Palm had a warranty , so I received a new " refurbished " unit . It worked for about 10 months , then I had this problem again . Had to change USB to a different cradle . It worked for a month , and then my PDA died all together . It will not start no matter what ! Needless to say , I lost all the data , and as a small business owner , it was a major problem for me . STAY AWAY FROM THIS THING !  
2	  I bought these because I was interested if they could actually stay in my ears while I jogged . They did but not in just a lil out of them . When running the actual headfone will comeout and dangle on outerside of the recess that makes the ear canal . They will stiil be around your ears but you will have to push them in again and again to get better sound and some Isolation . Sound on the otherhand is much better than what you can expect from a 10 $ earphone . Actually it was better than the Sennheiser MXL51 that I bought along with it . So Great Sound , but the grail of stable earphones still remains elusive .  
1	  I ordered and paid for a new unit . The recorder was dirty and dented and came in an old , beat-up box . The remote control didn't work . The supplier didn't have a replacement remote so he is going to send me a universal remote . I hope it works with the recorder . I have puchased quite a few large electronics from Amazon and this is the first time I 've had a problem . I guess it 's because it was an outside supplier .  
1	  I bought this with the matching pre-n card and it 's been so frustrating . Wireless connection almost completely useless since it constantly drops the connection . My wired connection sometimes stops working and then I have to reboot the router . I 've been checking tech support for a firmware upgrade / repair and nothing to be found . Reading the reviews , many people have been having these problems . I guess Belkin just feels a new sucker is born every minute . Well , this sucker is not buying anything from this company if I can help it . Another reviewer spoke well of the new Netgear Rangemax router . I 'll probably buy one of those to see if it 's better .  
2	  Hp original print cartridge works exactly as expected , no problems and I can trust the ink to work and not run or smear . Love HP products and would definitly buy them again . the quality of the product is second to none  
2	  My wife 's favorite Christmas present was a replacement Salad Shooter . I know , not very romantic , but it 's what she asked for . She 's had one for many years and finally wore it out . Life without a Salad Shooter in our house is unthinkable !  
1	  The camera seems to work ok but the software just freezes up most of the time andI have a terrible time getting the pictures . Not to mention the special effects , they just aren't what theyre cracked up to be . Now I cant even get tech support on it . the website .. wont even come up .  
2	  My roommate 's mom bought us two of these when I was in the dorms and I really loved them . I came to amazon hoping to find it , and I was excited to find the same one . The surge protector I received is the large white on you see in the thumbnail . For some reason when I 'm on the actual product page , it shows two photos of a black , flat surge protector - one of which was a customer submitted image . I bought the 6 ft cord one , I 'm not sure if that makes a difference . I was actually expecting to get the flat black one , so getting the larger , white one was a nice surprise . The design of this surge protector is really nice because it has a whole side dedicated to power bricks that usually cover up other outlets on most surge protectors . I also like the bulky size - it feels more substantial and it 's easy to reach the on / off switch . The only thing that would make me like it more is if it had USB ports on the side as opposed to telephone / ethernet ones .  
2	  I bought the CanoScan 8600F primarily to scan negatives and slides - both 35mm and medium format . The first one I bought had to be returned because there was a large speck of something under the glass . I probably wouldn't have noticed it if I was scanning prints , but blowing up 35mm made it too large to ignore . The second 8600 also had a speck under the glass but it 's small enough to work around . I recommend that the first thing you do after buying the 8600 is scan a smooth , white , paper at high resolution and check for specks in the center area where film is scanned . I also have an old HP PhotoSmart S-20 film scanner that I 've used for several years , but it can't do medium format . So , I thought , if nothing else , I could continue to use the S-20 for 35mm and use the CanoScan 8600F for my medium format material - hopefully , the CanoScan would be good enough to use for everything . I wanted another dedicated film scanner , but one for medium format is way too much money . I did extensive tests and found that the 8600 was very good , but my old S-20 still delivers a slightly better image from 35mm , even though its top resolution is only " 2400 " dpi . The CanoScan 8600F is very good , and , because it 's so easy and fast , I 'll probably use it for everything but my most critical 35mm work - and I finally have a scanner for all my medium format material .  
2	  I have a 17 " HP 9000 series notebook . HP sold thousands of these with a serious design flaw that results in extreme overheating of the upper left corner of the notebook , up by the on / off ( power ) button . The overheating is so severe that HP even did free repairs for the issue for a while . The heat causes the left screen hinge to fail , as well as the screen casing in my case . HP repaired my notebook but I knew it would fail again unless I addressed the underlying cause . I heavily researched cooling solutions . I had concluded that I required an expensive , large cooler with 2 fans . I was about to spend about $ 68 for the highly rated Zalman ZM-NC2000 Notebook Cooler when I came across this Handstands Cool Lift Portable Notebook Cooling Pad . It works like a charm ! My notebook is staying very cool , the notebook 's fan is staying off , putting less strain on my battery . HP should send one of these to each owner of their problematic 17 " 9000-series notebook line . This cooling pad cost me $ 60 less than the Zalman would have , will draw zero energy from my notebook , and will fit quite easily in my notebook bag , unlike the Zalman or other large coolers would have . In conclusion , I do not believe that notebook coolers need to be large and clunky products with unnecessary fans ; all you need is adequate air circulation underneath the notebook to prevent overheating . This product accomplishes that effectively , inexpensively and conveniently .  
2	  I had purchased a Sony CD walkman Mp3 player several years ago that came with a set of headphones just like this . I had since lost them and don't like the current styles out in the stores . I searched for these and found them , and they are just as I remembered , except the case was a little different , but it still rocks . Get these headphones if you don't like the uncomfortable plug in your head style that 's popular now . These are great cause I use them with all kinds of things , they fit in my CD player case , I use them with my PSP on the road . Mp3 players need headphones of course and these wind up in a neat little case that fits in a pocket or other small area easily . Highly recommended .  
1	  I bought a EX81LP / B about 1 yr ago . The sound is as good as I expected , but the cord began to fray after only 6 months . Now the metal wire inside exposes everywhere and makes this earphone a crap ! Just DON " T buy it ! unless you want a earphone that can last only half a year . Buy the Sennheiser CX300 or Creative EP630 . They are much better !  
1	  I have owned one for four months . I have mixed feelingabout it . It is a very durable walkman . I accidentally dropped it twice on concrete and there was no damage . Everythingworked fine on the walkman . My battery and cassette did not fly out upon impact . I am rough on my walkmans , which iswhy I brought this Panasonic . The battery compartment is inside the cassette compartment , which prevents the batteryfrom coming out upon impact . The cassette lid locks securely . The FM reception switch works well . It helps preventinterference from stronger stations . It 's now time for the negatives . Panasonic should have equipped this walkman withgood , conventional headphones . These " in ear " type headphones come loose often . When I ride my bike on a bumpyroad , I have to re-adjust the headphones too often . I suspect joggers have the same problem . This Panasonic model hasthe weakest super bass ( they call it XBS ) I have heard . The bass is too light . Panasonic 's own RQ-CR15V delivers more bass . The sound quality is decent , but it needs more bass . The FM reception switchis located inside the cassette compartment , which is inconvenient to operate when riding a bicycle . The play time ( tape ) with one battery is good , but it 's not 25 hours . If you have the XBS on and the volume is high , you can expect about 17hours of play time . I suspect that is why Panasonic gives you four batteries . And last , this walkman is design to playnormal position ( type 1 ) tapes only . You won't benefit from playing high bias ( Type II ) tapes . Type II tapes are generallysuperior to type I. On this walkman , normal position ( type I ) tapes sound better . If you invested in a lot of high bias tapes , look for a walkman that has a switch for normal position ( type I ) and high bias ( type II ) tapes . That is something Ineglected to do . Overall , I am a little disappointed with the Panasonic RQ-SW44V , but it is very durable .  
1	  These headphones and complete JUNK ! Sound is awful , crackly , NOT clear at all . Don't waste your money . Sending them back immediately !  
2	  This is an excellent sound card , and unless you need the bells-and-whistles of the other models in the X-Fi line , this is also the most economical . It is important to pair this card with a quality set of speakers , otherwise its clarity won't be appreciated . You already know the specs and features , so I won't repeat them here . The features work well . Positional audio in gaming is exceptional . Audio content creation is also excellent , allowing for over-sampling ( 24-bit Crystalizer for CD ripping ) . Provides both digital and analog 7.1 output . The only potential hangup is installation of the software and drivers . This is a complex product , and its drivers are likewise complex . There can be the occasional crash or instability associated with installing this piece of hardware . However , once it 's installed , it works great .  
1	  The Panasonic SLSX289V portable CD player is the poorest machinery I 've ever experienced using . It easily malfunctions when you put in a CD recordable disc , and there is no anti-shock button on the CD player , to prevent it from skipping . When I had to get this product fixed , Panasonic didn't do anything about it . Basically all that I got from this CD player , was a [ $ ] AM / FM radio . What a waste of good money . If you 're looking for a good portable CD player with a radio , get the Aiwa XP-R220 .  
1	  Difficult to configure for a PC and Mac . It worked for about a month then died . I sent it in and when it returned I set it up and it worked for about 2 days then died again . Haven't decided if I should dig a hole and bury it or send it in again .  
1	  Being that the OEM BMW dash kit has been discontinued , I tried out this replacement . Leaving all the other quirks with BMW radios and amplifiers aside , this kit is only " OK " . First thing you notice is the faceplate is black . If it was grey like the radio you were replacing , or the vents above , it would be better . The color is that cheap plastic black material that you find in most kits . Unfortunately the black stands out like a sore thumb on the dash . Really ugly . The fit of the kit is also only ' ok ' . I bought it to use with an aftermarket head unit and the front plate of the Scosche dash kit doesn't allow the head unit to places through the opening , it goes on top of the unit . Basically you install your head unit , the side pieces of the dash kit and then place the front piece on top . Being the opening is too small , if you have a head unit that opens for CD 's , you 're out of luck . Moving the head unit forward makes the kit not ' click ' on the bottom with the two tabs . And moving it back makes it hit the metal plate in the rear . In short , you 're stuck . If you want aftermarket , you almost have to use this , but it really isn't a good kit . If anyone finds the BMW kit , Part Number 65900301349 , please let me know . You 'd be better off with that , it 's the correct color and fits the whole head unit .  
1	  I have tried this screen twice now and both times the product was delivered broken . Sorry , I just cant afford to try a third so I am going to look for something else . Reviews sound great and I figured that the first one was a fluke , but two in a row .. The flip side is that Amazons returns policy have made it very easy for me to send this item back , so 5 star for Amazon but I cant rec 'd this screen .  
1	  Cable does not fit HP315 even though description says it does . The only reason I 'm not returning it is because shipping would cost me more than I paid for the item .  
2	  This is my first digital camera and I love it . I am a novice . It does everything I had hoped for and more . Dowloading images to my computer is really easy . The battery life is great and recharging is also easy - just plug it in . I am very happy with this camera and know that if I want additional lenses , they are available .  
1	  I have had this for 6 months now , it works intermittently at best . I get it working all set up with everything fine . This will last for a couple of days . Then it stops working , so I have to unplug it to get it to reset ( I guess ) . After unplugging , it will work again for a day or two , then back to having to unplug it . I am getting something else .  
1	  I bought this because I want a pair for work out . Later I found out it is really not comfortable to wear it since the little thing keeps stretching my ears . The soound quality is soso . I did compared it with my ipod ear buds . I found out that this pair has even worse performance comparing to those ipod ear phones .  
1	  Now it doesn't even work anymore . Horrible horrible cheap quality right here . Don't waste your time or money . Now I have no music . .  
1	  Without clear instruction , a product isn't worth a dime . The unit is premature for release and confusing . The only use for the insturctin book is as toilet paper . Perhaps it was written by Chineese . If you have nothing to do , but run around in circles , shell out $ 600 ! If you plan to use it without a career in guessing how to make it work , get something else .  
2	  I was told by the guy at the Apple store that I needed to use the insert for my 2G Nano . So , I used the one provided with the IH6 and it didn't work . On a whim , I placed my Nano in the clock without any insert and it worked ! Hope this helps someone .. It 's a great product .  
1	  If you buy the nuvi 275T new , it comes with an auto plug-in that also has the FM receiver . No need for this extra plug unless you want a back-up .  
1	  for the first year it worked great , I formatted it into an NTFS format since it came in FAT32 . It worked in regular usb2 speed , nothing over the top . and after about a year it started giving me an unreadable error , so each time I wanted to use it it asked me format the flash drive , which I kept doing over and over again in hope to see a change , but nothing happened , it kept giving me the same problem . and when it didnt , It was giving me the problem when I was trying to plug the flash drive on a different computer , so it was either only recognized on my PC , and not working on others , or unreadable on any PC at all ( including mine ) . I 've decided to stop using it , its a shame , I bought this when it was around $ 23.99 ( 16GB ) . Wont recommend it , very untrustworthy , luckily I backed up the data I had before the " unreadable error " began .  
1	  The Mighty Mouse looks great . That 's all it has going for it . I 've had the mouse for about a year and it 's practically non-functional . The worse part is the " revolutionary " 360-degree scroll wheel . I have to clean it at least monthly , otherwise it stops working . Sometimes it stops scrolling up , sometimes down . Apple recommends running a damp cloth over the ball-this barely works . Instead , you have to take the whole mouse apart ( not for the squeamish ) and clean four tiny magnet-like screws that interact with the scroll ball . Not user-friendly at all ( and the way Apple has headed with its hardware , that 's not surprising ) . Buy something else . Don't buy this simply because it 's made by Apple .  
1	  I decided to replace my camcorder 's Tiffen 58mm Enhancing filter by this Tiffen 58mm Warm CPL . After I opened the filter box ( labeled 58mm ) , I found a 52mm inside . So , I immediately contacted to Amezon . com , two days later , I received another one ( excellent job , Amazon ) . But , when I opened the box , it was 52mm again . When I was ready to contact to Amazon again , I felt suspicious - the 52mm filter fit to the 58mm box really good . So , I tried to mount the 52mm filter to the 58mm filter , they fitted perfectly ( see the attached picture ) .  
1	  I have backed up all of my pictures on this hard drive and it 's a good thing I have them on disk also , because it died after about a year and a half ! I 'm very disappointed that THIS is supposed to be my backup in case something happened to my computer and it died ! Not to mention that I spent $ 160.00 on this worthless piece of junk !  
1	  I couldn't get this to work with my phone . Not sure if it is the product or if it is the phone . Hope to get different phone in future . Will try it again with new phone .  
2	  Honestly , I thought it was going to be a piece of crap . But surprisingly it wasn't . :) I lost mine like before December .. The very same model .. so , I had tobuy a new one .. :] i LOVE IT .  
1	  I liked the interface of this player , but it has some real problems with skipping . At first I thought it was a problem with the media I was using to burn my CD 's but then I used the media shipped with the product ( you get 3 free CD 's with the player ) and found the player still skipped . The player would skip even without movement , at random , even in ESP mode , and while playing MP3 CD 's . ( With ESP off it almost wouldn't work . ) Also , the player has no Hold switch . ( The hold switch keeps you from accidently pressing buttons when the player is in your pocket or purse . ) I returned it . You shouldn't buy it , go for a RioVolt or something from a more reputable company , like Sony , Panasonic , or even Phillips . Even if it costs a little more , you 'll end up saving yourself the hassle of returning it . The interface and four line display , radio , and headphones are all very nice , much better than I expected , but that doesn't make up for the skipping .  
1	  I 'm sure this is a wonderful product and my friend who bought it from me loves it on his pc based home network . Unfortunately , mine is entirely a Mac house and no matter what we tried , we couldn't get it to work with any of our computers or printers .  
1	  Do not , repeat , do not , buy this item . I puchased one late last year , and within 1 month all of a sudden when I tried to download a file a message came on my computer " memory card is corrupted , see your olympus dealer " . I had to deal with this by having an outside transcriptionist listen to my files and type them out . Having liked my previous recorder from Olympus a few years ago , I thought I would give this one another shot though , so I ordered a new one . Now after using it for a little more than 1 month , I 'm getting the SAME MESSAGE ! I have a 2 1/2 hour long file that 's URGENT and this dictaphone won't download the file and it 's outside the time I can send it back to Amazon ! Please be smarter than me - use another dictaphone manufacturer !  
2	  bought to connect Windows XP and 98SE computers , the system has a strong signal and has been very reliable . The Network Utility feature is excellent for home use . Only negative was a poor quality install wizard on the included software CD . Had to use MSN tech support , but they were cheerful and efficient ( minimal wait time ) . Tech Support rep said that the install wizard is a little buggy and doesn't work as well as they hoped .. other than having to " ask for help " it 's a great purchase which has expanded our in home computer capability AND enjoyment .  
1	  Works fine for the first couple of months but as I read in other reviews , the left click button begins to stick and act as if you 're holding it down while you scroll . Picking the thing up off the desktop by about an inch and dropping it can shock the button lose , but it 's only a matter of time - just a few clicks - until it happens again . Sad , because overall it 's a nice device but as with so many manufacturers , poor quality to save a buck has doomed their product to be merely mediocre at best .  
2	  Worked well with my laptop , picked up 12-16 Dtv channels , software that came with it is okay but media center is better  
2	  The NG102 works like it should-with one exception that I 've found . If you set it up in Bridge Mode , it will NOT work with WPA security-you can only use the inferior WEP security . WEP can be cracked in under 24 hours ( the netgear helpfiles built into the WG102 setup pages even say this ) , but they still force you to use WEP security when bridging . Additionally , Netgear 's tech support is ABYSMAL . I have submitted several trouble tickets with questions , and it sometimes takes them TWO WEEKS to reply-and even then they did not give a reasonable answer to my question , they gave a stock answer to something I didn't ask . The user suport forum is much better , but you 're not guaranteed to get any help there , either . * UPDATE : 12/27 - I 'd like to downgrade this product to ONE STAR ! * This access point would lock up at least once a day . The only solution was to unplug the power and plug it back in . I found it had particular difficulty when trying to transfer files over the local network and when running internet speed tests ( such as ww . speakeasy . net / speetest ) . Somehow they seemed to confuse or overwhelm the access point , and it had to be hard-reset . Neither of those activities should have caused it any trouble at all-especially not this ( much more expensive ) " business-class " access point . After spending way too much time troubleshooting the problem , I have finally given up and will return it .  
2	  Not much to say here . Cable works great , no problems to report . The price certainly makes it an attractive choice . I would purchase again .

1	  Didn't have trouble w / these until right now , I tried burning on CDs from pack of 5 that I bought this morning and none of them work ! I just submitted a warranty claim w / memorex and am requesting a refund NOT replacement . I 've also had problems w / Memorex CDRWs of 12x and 24x speeds , especially the 24x speed . I have over five of them that recorded well initially but then couldn't open them ever w / any computer . Lost a semester 's worth of data ! Geez .  
2	  This is really good . I bought it last weekend ( today is thursday ) and it has worked really really well . It plays the music i put on it better then ive ever heard it before , even better then my cd player . It has really good controls and buttons , which i think are much easier then those of my brothers 15 GB ipod . The battery life is fine , i dont know why people keep saying its not enough . Eight hours is alot . Think about it , how many days a week are you going to spend exactly eight hours listening to your ipod , espeially if you have school . Also , the storage space is actually alot as well if u think about it . 1,000 songs is alot of music to hold at one time . Most people who have the 15 GB or higher hardly fill up more then 1,000 songs anyway . Besides if you get tired of the music that you have on it , then take it off by simply hooking it up to itunes and deleting it off and then you can fill it up again with new music . I also like the material its made of more then the normal ipods , because the mini is made of a metal that doesn't scratch unless you purposely get something sharp and scratch it . The only problem that i had with it ( I dont have it anymore ) is that when i hooked it up to my PC , it was encredibly hard to get i to work . Ive had itunes for a month or so , so its not like im new to itunes . I plugged it in and it had all of these different formatting errors that took me roughly four hours to figure out and fix . So unless you 're a computer genious , then plan to spend a couple hours being really angry that it wont instantly download your music .  
1	  Casio , a leader in retail electronics and one of the first on the market with the Pocket PC ( windows CE ) device has sadly let their lead slip away . They remain the most expensive of the Pocket PC 's and it 's darned near impossible to find accessories . I have a Cassiopeia Pocket PC which I will keep but if I had it to do again , I 'd save a hundred bucks and buy an HP or Compaq Pocket PC . Same quality , better price , and easy to find goodies like keyboards and cases .  
1	  Be careful when buying these discs based on the picture . They don't have the label as shown . They are blank white in the middle and are made for ink jet printing . Check the manufacturer 's web site for pictures .  
2	  I have had this device for about 2 months now , have used it for an extensive trip to the east coast and absolutely love it . Terrific screen , very bright and always visible in direct sunlight . Text to voice feature is priceless . Guidance is as good as can be expected from any of these devices ( this is my third ) . Downside .. Beanbag mount is unsatisfactory if you care to use any amount of acceleration in your car . My unit has flown off the dash several times onto the center console . Good news is the unit is built like a brick and hasn't been damaged . I could use the adhesive dash mount , but really don't want to deal with the residue when I eventually move on .. either the car or the 2720 . Wish there was a windshield suction mount available .  
1	  I wasted my money here . The drivers install okay ( both from the included CD and download from Trendnet 's website ) , but neither my Windows 7/64 or Vista computers will recognize the device . I called Trendnet 's tech support and was told that they do not have drivers for Windows 7 or Vista . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE THESE OPERATING SYSTEMS .  
1	  I loved everything about this keyboard except for one problem . I am a heavy internet user , and normally I can get about a year out of a keyboard before the keys begin to show heavy wear . The Saitek II began to deteriorate within a week of usage . I couldn't believe it . I had bought it at Best Buy , and they kindly replaced it with another , and IT wore out within a couple of weeks as well . I figured the store must have received a defective shipment . So this time I returned it directly to the manufacturer , thinking I could get around the issue that way . I got out the keyboard that came with my Mac to use in the meantime-great keyboard , but the keys are a little harder for older eyes to see , because the lettering is smaller , and there 's less contrast . I used the mac keyboard till I wore the paint off several keys , which took about a year-and then I hooked up the second replacement Saitek . The third Saitek did what the first two did , I have used it for only about a week now , and the " E " is already half gone , and the S , A , O , and N are showing noticeable wear . I would happily use a Saitek Eclipse II for the rest of my life if not for this issue , but who can afford to replace a keyboard weekly ? Apparently they got everything right but the paint .  
1	  The only thing that is cool about this thing is all the things it can do .. now if only it did them . It will charge my ipod and play it , but when it plays my Ipod it automatically starts it from the first song on it , not what I put it on . And my Ipod started malfunctioning after being plugged into this system . The remote went out within the first week . It will load up DVD 's but you can't play them . It will go to the menu and then doesn't let you play anything . So all I got out of this was a am / fm radio .. not worth the $ 120  
1	  We recently purchased a smaller version of this TV-a new one . Same problem , within 5 months , the power died , and the repair bill will be $ 150 , if it is worth fixing . We certainly aren't going to bother ..  
2	  My wife has a PT Cruiser and I have a Jeep Wrangler . I bought this for one , but it ended up only fitting the other . My suggestion is look up the correct part number at Scosche for your vehicle and buy it here . The vehicle mapping here is not correct .  
1	  I knew this was to cheap but this thing is junk . I have used Tiffen for years but this is just plain junk . If I taped a nickel to it and threw it away at least I could say I threw something away . As a matter of fact I think I will . On every lens I used it on all Canon L lenses the images were soft and it has a wierd glow coming from somewhere . Beats me but don't buy it . I gave it a one because I think you have to give it something .  
1	  Very disappointed ! Have not been able to use the product because it does not work . It was to be a new item , but when it arrieved it looked as if it had been well used and returned . Hopefully I will get another one soon to try . So for now not good .  
1	  i had so much hope for another ' secret history ' but this sure isn't it . what happened ? i kept thinking if i read just one more page it would get better , but it never did . the whole snake thing was just too much , too ridiculous . i don't think this would even make a bad movie . c'mon , donna , where 's the stuff ?  
1	  I actually own the 110 model . After 18 months , it no longer reads disks PERIOD . Read the other reviews and avoid Panasonic .  
1	  I bought this two weeks ago and looked forward to getting it . However I was very disappointed that it would not play my homemade movie collection . The only discs it would play are store bought movies . Everything else freezes up within minutes of starting . Picture quality was good and I thought the menus , remote , and general ease of use was fine , but that is besides the point if you can't watch your movie .  
2	  I have several short wave radios , AM / FM radios . I listen to BBC and I found that instead of changing frequency numbers in my shortwave radio , I can listen to the same channel in the XM radio ( XM 131 ) crisp clear digital quality which my expensive shortwave radio can not provide . I was an avid listener to world music . I used to tune to Global Village in radio canada international . The producer kept changing the day and time . I had to be ready by 7 PM on Saturday to listen to only one hour of music brought from all over the world . This XM satellite radio and the high quality boom box brings world music to you for 24 hours in a 7 day schedule with digital quality music . Antenna reception in my geographic location is great . I wanted to take this boom box out while driving ( with battery power - 6 D cells ) . I kept the boom box on the floor between front and back seats . There is fading of signals specially while driving north . As an experiment , my wife held the boom box on her lap ( the box loaded with batteries is heavy ) , on the front passenger seat . The reception was better but none while driving north . Bottom line , one has to buy the receiver ( I had a good deal of $ 80 from Circuit City ) , the boom box ( $ 99 ) to listen to the music at home . Then buy a kit for fitting into the car ( additional $ 70 + professional help with a charge of $ 40 for installation ) . This will let you have proper antenna installation in the car . The cost adds up . But , like me , as a starter , I recommend this system for pleasure at home of listening to music , news , sports as a feast , which traditional am / fm radio can not provide commercial free and suitable for your taste . You can listen to National Public Radio 's super quality program ( not available in your am / fm radio 's standard npr program ) , blues , music from 50 's , 60 's etc , reggae music and much more . Monthly membership fee is $ 10 on top on other cost estimates I mentioned above . This is great stuff . I love it . I am just listening to it for about a week only .  
1	  In March of 2006 , I purchased an ipod shuffle . True , it 's about twice the size of the ipod shuffle now , but it came with a lanyard , a headphone plug and a USB plug for charging . After receiving the latest ipod shuffle , the fist problem I encountered was the clip . It hanged or flopped over instead of being securely clipped on and staying upright , and I was not aware the latest ipod shuffle required the wearing of specific types of clothing to be secure . Ugh . And , since it is a clip , of course , there 's no attachment for a lanyard , so I used a thick shoe lace and threaded it through the clip instead , so I can wear it around my neck . The worse thing I discovered , however , is that Apple did not include a separate plug for charging which creates a serious problem-a lot of wear and tear . Every single headphone plug I 've used over the years would start to lose contact with the contact points over time , and unfortunately , it doesn't take long for it to occur if you keep plugging in and unplugging the head phones . The contact points wear down , and it reaches the point where the slightest movement of the headphone plug can cause music to cut out and you have to fiddle with it constantly in order to keep both " stereo " channels or any music going at all . For me , too , I found the clip itself made matters worse because the headphone plug would get yanked or bent downward when I was moving around . After just one attempt at wearing the ipod shuffle with the clip and my music cutting out several times , I knew it was time to come up with some kind of lanyard . Unfortunately , the lanyard doesn't solve the problem about the headphone and charging plug being the same and all the wear and tear it 's required to take . As a result , I have been using my older shuffles far more , for I suspect my new ipod shuffle is not going to last nearly as long due to this particular poor design by Apple .  
1	  The Linksys router out of the box was faulty . It took 2 days of constant calling to get Linksystech support , all to tell me the unit was no good . I e-mailed Amazon for a replacement . It took them 3days to reply . " We will send a mailer for it 's return . " That was 16 days ago and I 've seen nothing . .. Amazon should stick to books . Customers should buy their hard goods locally . FRS  
2	  I thought I was ordering clear heat shrink tape to cover cable labels on my DIY cables . However product is actually a heat shrink film that apparently is used for packaging . However on second look I got exactly what I ordered and can not in any way fault the seller . Should not order late at night when you 're half asleep . I have not tried to contact seller to return because the product works perfectly in a different application I have at work . It is the perfect size to cover labels on LISTA cabinet drawers and is actually cheaper than what we were using . Still looking for clear heat shrink Tape if there is such a product but very happy with product for unintended use .  
1	  I just got this card recently after seeing the good reviews . After a couple days of use , the card starting giving me a write error . I plan to return it . I should have bought a brand name card in the first place .  
2	  This 512mb Ultra II SD Card makes a world of difference if you have the right camera to take advantage of it . I currently use this card with my Canon SD200 which has a Digic II Processor . This awesome camera / card combo allowed me to quickly take multiple pics of runners during the LA Marathon . I was able to focus on certain runners and rapidly take pics before moving on to the next . After the 5 months of constant use I have not experience any problems with this card . I highly recommend it .  
2	  I have used many projectors in my career but never used an InFocus Projector . When I bought it I liked the price and decided to give it a try . The projector was sent to me in a very timely fashion . It is used but in great shape and very easy to use . All in all this has been a good experience  
2	  Like so many others that use it ; I love this stuff ! Used it for a new cooler I bought ( Zalman 9900MAX ) on a phenom II Hex-core over clocked to 4.0ghz with other variables over clocked to a far reaching extent . Cool temperatures idle and full load . I have reviewed the 9900MAX so feel free to look up my review of it as it goes into depth on temp and such with my setup . Pro 's : competitively pricedEffective heat desperationGood for more than one useCon 's : NoneOther thought 's : I used the dot method with the application  
1	  This case does not fit the Nikon Coolpix 1000pj . It is small for that camera although they say it can fit it .  
1	  .. and buy a GPS instead . I agree with previous reviewer ( Dave57 ) , I WOULD NEVER BUY A SUUNTO AGAIN . Worst than Dave , I simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my Vector was full of water , couldn't even tell the time . I send it to Suunto Finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and " kindly " offered a repair for 140 Euros .  
2	  This is the third Logan Slide File that I have ordered . Good product for the purpose for which it was designed .  
1	  We bought the KX-TG5210M and the optional extra handset ( KX-TGA520M ) in Dec . 2004 . The display on the option handset quit working in Jan . 2005 . Like the other reviewer said , a phone that doesn't work is worthless . In addition , after answering a call on one of the handsets , the other handset ( the one I didn't answer ) shows a missed call even though I just answered it . This is annoying because you can't keep track of calls you missed because some of the calls shown as missed were actually answered .  
2	  Excellent job on photos . Better than having them developed . My only concern is how long the cartridges will last as they are kind of pricey . However at this point I would reccommend the printer . Setup was easy and it works great .  
1	  This seemed like the perfect add-on to the Macbook Air for a wired ethernet port . It worked beautifully and gave me fast speeds for exactly 40 days and then the lights went off and it no longer works . For something that breaks that quickly , save your money for a better model .  
1	  First - in no way should this reflect on the seller ! They did their job of sending the toner on time , and when it failed to work , they sent a second one - which to my dismay is headed back also . They have offered a full refund and as far as I 'm concerned should still be considered for other ink . As far as this toner , it would not adhere to the paper , the first page * might * come out halfway decent , but the next pages were so light that you couldn't read the majority of the words . That was the second toner cartridge - the first was so light that the FEDEX Shipment label that I printed out for the return I questioned if they would accept it . I learned my lesson . I did this as an experiment as I know a few others that have this printer and wanted to know if it could save us some money . Well it did . I screwed up my system so others wouldn't . Money saved for them . Again , do not take this as a negative on the dealer - just the product not being compatible .  
1	  This battery arrived in unsealed plastic packaging , meaning the battery could be removed and replaced without affecting the packaging at all . Furthermore , the packaging was not form fitting to the battery ; it was just floating around inside the package . Furthermore , the plastic itself was broken ! Oh , and big surprise , the battery didn't work . At all .  
1	  We bought this antenna as a test to see if we could HD or any stations on a spare HD LCD tv . We live in the Boston area and there are HD and regular stations available . Followed the simple instructions and this thing didn't work at all .  
2	  Replaced all the remotes on the coffee table . Satellite remote , receiver and Roku . All of my devices were preprogrammed . Just had to find the number and that was it . What really makes it useful is the macro function ( storing multiple commands on one button ) . The power blaster works . I placed inside the cabinet and it 's powerful enough to control the devices without pointing and no direct line of sight . The back-lighting of the keys is nice but could have been a little better . Buy it .  
1	  Although the product description states that this map is compatible with Nuvi series 300 , it is not as presented on the SD card . Older model Nuvi ( Garmin support says series 200 an 300 for sure ) cannot handle map files larger than 2 Gigabyte in size . The newer European maps are just over that limit . You can get the maps on DVD or download them from Garmin , then you install them via the computer using MapInstall or MapSource software to break the file up into smaller pieces . However , with the SD maps , you CANNOT do this . Returned for full refund from Amazon . I will be relying on a smart phone for navigation from now on .  
2	  Ok , so I get a little excited . Yes , I love this product , but there 's practically nothing to it . It was so easy to hook up , and takes up so little room on my otherwise overloaded media center . It 's like having a whole stereo component , but takes up only a few inches of space . Forget the car . Every home needs satellite radio , and this little sweetheart makes it ridiculously easy to have . One advantage to having XM at home is that it 's really easy to find the best spot for the antenna , so reception is never an issue . It works like a dream every time I plug in the unit .  
2	  All in all a great product . It makes things much easier and I dont have a million remotes to look for . I havent encountered the charging problems previously talked about in other reviews . It does forget once in awhile but quickly ecovers . I highly recommend it and I 'm very happy with the purchase .  
1	  Forget about the horrible quality of the photos , that 's to be expected of such a cheap camera and of course it 's difficult to use . BUT to lose the pictures that you 've already taken because the batteries ( that you had to buy BTW because it doesn't come withthem ) died , that 's pathetic and makes this camera completely useless and a waste of money .  
1	  I 'LL KEEP IT SHORT AND SWEET : I WAS JUST TOLD THAT THIS PANASONIC POWER SUPPLY DOES NOT WORK WITH MY NEW PANASONIC CORDLESS PHONE SYSTEM , MODEL NO . KX-TG4031 . EVEN I JUST PLACED THE ORDER 30 MINUTES AGO , IT IS ALREADY IN PROCESS AND CANNOT BE CANCELLED OR CHANGED . THE THING PROBABLY WORKS WITH CERTAIN OTHER PHONE SYSTEMS , BUT I SHALL BE STUCK WITH A USELESS BACK-UP POWER SUPPLY FOR MY PHONE 'S BASE UNIT . BUYER , BEWARE !  
2	  Superb device that will add information and light when you most need it . I bought four and gave two to my friends . This emergency radio will more than pay for itself the first hurricane , tornado , or bad ice storm you go through . I like the durability and case it comes in . Need to change the color to Red or Orange or add reflective tape or marking , to both the radio and case . That can be for the next product improvement cycle , for now , this one more than does the job  
2	  .. and my FJ270 is still running smoothly . This is my 2nd Vaio notebook that I 've owned . My first one lasted 3.5 years - I sold it at that point ( for $ 400 ) since I was going to upgrade to a newer model . I 'll probably be upgrading from this one in the not-too-distant future , and yes , I will stick with Vaio . Vaios are a big cost up front , but it 's worth it in the long run . Let me first say that while Vaio batteries don't last very long ( I got 2 hours max ) , they will live for AGES . I 'm running this guy on AC power right now because the original battery only died about a month ago . When was the last time you heard of a battery lasting for over 3 years ? ! Mind you , I use this laptop every day . But aside from that , here are some pros : - Unbelievably sturdy and well built-Great display-Great sound quality-Keyboard ( I don't have sticky issues with the keys like some people say they do ) - Good quality cameraAnd some cons : - Runs hot . My older Vaio did this too , and it 's annoying , but I guess it 's the big trade-off . My laptop has outlasted my brother 's Toshiba , countless Dells belonging to friends , AND a Macbook . - Battery never lasted more than 2 hours . - CD / DVDrom is kind of noisy . I definitely recommend this model . Very pleased with Vaio notebooks in general .  
2	  It does everything it states it will do . Delivery was before expected . Works even in - 15 degree weather . Customization capabilities for specific needs ( rate adjustments ) .  
1	  I 've used numerous 19HS for casual stuff over the years without incident ; However I recently hooked two weather stations to a system running win7 x64 and now I get a BSOD ( IRQL not less than .. ) every few days . I have two 19HS connected , running the latest drivers and latest windows updates . Google for 19HS and BSOD ; It appears to be known but unresolved issue ( on xp , vista , win7 ) . I 'm now looking for a new solution that wont BSOD ..  
2	  I am using this switch to connect two printers and a scanner to both a Mac and a PC running Vista . Works really well . The switch time is very quick and I have not noticed any USB speed issues . I have had this setup working for a few weeks now and all seems to work well .  
1	  I purchased a Canon Powershot A710 7.1MP Digital camera and it is not working properly . It keeps telling me to change the batteries . I have had the same exact camera before and bought this one because I dropped my other one and broke it , so I am familiar with the camera . It is definitely a defect . Every time I turn the camera on , it tells me to change the batteries . I have tried different kinds of batteries alsom , and that 's not the problem . I would like a refund from the seller .  
1	  My DSL line has little problem to me so far . However , after I install this product , I connect my PC and laptop with it . I start my bad days . my pc and laptop freeze frequency . At the very beginning , I don't know know what happen . After trouble shooting on computers , I find nothing wrong but when I work on internet , email or doing the files transfer to my office . Later , I disconnect my DSL router and everything work fine now . I rate this product to 2 stars because it is easy to install .  
2	  Pros - Nice screen , scratch resistant casing , looks good , fm radio , customizable background . Cons - wireless is uselss , screen resolution same as ipod . Great buy for 200 bucks .  
2	  Son has a laptop that will not stop overheating . I looked at various coolers online and found this one to be high quality and affordable . Since he first plugged it in and kept it on my son has yet to have a problem with his laptop . Now that 's quality ! I recommend this to anyone with an overheating laptop . You simply cannot go wrong .  
1	  HAD TO OPEN PACKAGE TO FIND VOLTAGE  
2	  If you need microsoft points , it 's just easier to come here . It was quick and I had the points on my xBox within minutes .  
2	  These are great cables and well worth the money . Item arrived on time and at a great price . Who could ask for anything more ?  
1	  THE GOOD : I was able to easily connect my Palm Tungsten E2 & Sony Ericsson T637 to my various Macintosh computers . So , for roughly $ 10 ( after rebate ) I really can't complain too much about this adapter . THE BAD : However , I was NOT able to make a connection with any of my bluetooth headsets which was the main reason for buying this device . The bluetooth system preference ( OS X 10.4.4 ) was able to recognize the headsets and even get the manufacturer and model numbers , but would then say that the bluetooth hardware would not support headsets . If anyone knows of a work-around for this I would LOVE to hear about it . Otherwise it looks like I am going to have to pony up for the D-Link adapter if I want to use my extra bluetooth headset to use with Skype .  
1	  UPDATE : DO NOT BUY ! ITS NOT RELIABLE , COULD BE DANGEROUS ! One of my two units fried after only a few months . I suspect the tranformer had a short in it . The transformer got so hot the hard plastic enclosure melted . Too hot to touch . This was in a cool 55 degF room . Luckily it didn't burn my house down . I can no longer access the HDD from my home file serve . Hopefully , it didn't damage the HDD itself , still testing . Unfortunately its past Amazon 's the 30 days return policy . - original reviewAmazon part of purchase was OK , typical Amazon transaction . I bought two units , have both units working great . I 'm happy now , BUT .. product is bargain priced , you get what you pay for . CONS : - Installation is for the mechanically inclined and PC h / w component savy . Package is absent any instructions on how to open the case and physically install your hard drive . Its like a puzzle box . A user could easily be frustrated or even break components installing their HDD . - Internal cabling is stiff and space is cramped , could easily cause a connector , wire or cable to be loose or even break during installation . - I had two units , each with different parts which fit poorly . AFTER I knew how to open the case , I had a corner on a plastic part break off opening the second unit because the front cover fit so tightly ( must have been forced on in the factory ) . Fortunately , no adverse impact . PROS : - As for final operation , the aluminum case w / HDD installed runs cool , even cooler than the power transformer . - Price very low , notably cheaper than comparable products . - Comes with free external SATA cable , half the price of the product if bought seperate . - Comes with convienent free screw driver for assembly . Would I buy again ? For home use , YES to save money , recession and all . For business / customer / relative , NO for fear / risk of time delays if product needs returned , reliability & customer satisfaction .  
2	  I bought this refurbished and the price was much lower than new . It is factory conditioned and tested and since they lack moving parts and are intended for years of use with a warranty I had nothing to lose . With this gateway I am not paying the cable company lease charges on the cheapest modem they can acquire and I have consolidated two components into one .  
2	  It was such a cheap price , and the reviews said it either worked or it didn't . I decided to take the chance , and it works like a charm . My Xbox360 game quality is noticeably better , and the cable was such a steal !  
1	  I bought this off-camera flash bracket at the end of a camera equipment spending spree . I didn't have enough money left to get what I wanted , so I settled for the ProMaster . Well , it 's cheap construction and flimsy quality almost made me feel embarrassed to use it in public ! The little " strap " that goes around your hand for extra support is made of plastic . Worst of all , after only a few uses the flash mount clip broke off . It was held in by 3 tiny screws that wouldn't screw back into place because the screw holes were stripped when it broke . Save your money and buy something that will last .  
1	  AMAZON 's product description states that " You can make your files available publicly over the Internet or create password-protected accounts for authorized users " ; this was my main reason for buying the router , however , this feature is not documented at all in the manual , and Linksys ' tech support hasn't been able to tell me if the feature is supported or not .  
1	  Bought this system as way to protect my garage . Cold weather renders the Infrared detector useless and the door sensor goes through a battery every month . Outdoor siren is difficult to sync with control unit and mine went off for no reason and did not sound when it should have .  
2	  Love the Creative Zen ! For the money , you cannot beat the value . Excellent battery life , and easy to get to the battery if you had to . No need to send back to the company like an iPod , which my daughter has .  
2	  I loved this 3M flat panel mounted copy holder so much that after I received the first one for my office computer , I ordered another one for my home computer . I would have given it a 5-star , but the lower score was because I thought it was a bit overpriced . However , it was very easy to put together , and it really helps me see the documents I 'm typing on my computer , otherwise I would need to buy tri-focal eyeglasses to see at the necessary typing distance . I like how it swings back out of the way when not in use . I did have to tighten the nut to prevent the stand from swinging backwards while typing .  
1	  I purchased a 2Gb Extreme II SD Card , and it stores the images taken with my DSLR , but it does not display the files in my PC , through the Sandisk usb adapter . Therefore , I have to plug the camera directly to the PC . It is very inconvenient .  
2	  I got this used and really just needed the charger . But I got the palm and a keyboard and leather case and the charger . So I just started using this one . I use it as a pocket size Kendal and download ebooks to it . For $ 20 a great buy .  
2	  This is great . With windows media player 10 this mp3 player is so easy to work . I just had to buy a second one  
2	  I bought this card for use with my Nokia 6126 , and it works great . It obviously adds a ton of memory to the phone , so I can add pictures , videos , and music files . It 's affordable and well-worth it !  
2	  Set this up without any problems ( no tech support ! ) and have been using wirelessly for over one week without any problems .  
1	  Followed directions for using the cable . Upon connecting it to my iPod Touch 2nd Gen , the iPod displayed a message that the unit could not be charged . I called Monster and they said Apple revised the interface and I needed to purchase the Monster iCarPlay Wireless 250 instead if I wanted my iPod to charge using the FM transmitter . Will now be going to get this other unit .  
1	  Microtek has a genuine professional pedigree ; for years I saw Microtek scanners at the newspapers I worked for . And the 4900 has the apprearance of being a professional model , with sophisticated adjustments for tweaking color , etc . It also has some great features for amateurs , such as seven buttons on the scanner that can be customized , so that you could , for example , scan the same photo at 100 dpi , 300 dpi , 600 dpi , 48-bit , 24-bit , tif and jpeg , all without fiddling with the computer . But the instructions are not written for amateurs , and many features are not clearly explained . The program seems to default to allowing multiple frames , with the result that I got several crop lines on the preview screen I could not get rid of , and multiple images each time I scanned . But don't try looking up " crop " or " auto crop " in the help section - they aren't there . I tried to find out more on the Microtek web site , but it was down . Earth to Microtek : Look at each of your screens and each of the functions on each screen and write instructions for how to use them for your help section , not just a one-sentence label of what they are . The bottom line is quality , and the images are not up to par for professionals . I tried using the film adapter and found it worthless , unable to produce sharp images . But what is worse , I discovered that there was heavy horizontal and vertical streaking . At the maximum optical resolution of 2,400 dpi the vertical streaking was about six pixels wide , and was obvious even on the small preview image . This streaking was typically down to about two pixels wide at 1,200 dpi , and was still visable at 600 dpi . When I switched to a grayscale scan it was even more obvious , meaning the light sensitivity of the CCD sensors was inconsistent . There was also horizontal streaking , though less obvious . When I switch to scanning an opaque subject , the streaking was not quite as obtrusive , but still obvious if you knew what to look for . Since the streaking is visable at 600 dpi , this means the useable resolution of this 2,400 dpi optical scanner is only 300 dpi . At this rate , the images are not even up to par for amateurs . The color of the scans was good , but I would not call it professional . And it did not seem to me to be exceptionally sharp . Scans are fast , but the scanner is slow to respond , so total time is not so good . Loading the driver after clicking on the icon is agonizingly slow on my 566 mhz Celeron , and there is no " wait " icon . The OCR program is the worst I have ever tried to use , and I 've owned three other scanners . This may be the right scanner for some people . Basic functions are easy to use - if the scanner does not default to some cryptic mode . But anything more will take several days of experimentation to learn , unless you are a professional . I 'm not , and this scanner is going back .  
1	  Got it at a great price . Liked it . Used it , didn't abuse it . But for whatever reason , it just stopped working - way too soon . Maybe I got the lemon , but I can't recommend it - wish I could - just like I wish this mouse lasted much longer before it failed !  
1	  i just purchased this play and charge kit from BlueMall and it doesn't even work . when i purchased it i thought it was too good to be true to only be $ 9 when they usually are $ 20 and what do you know it was to good to be true because its not a microsoft product even though it says it is and the battery didnt want to charge . I would not recommend this device because its a waste of money .  
2	  I just bought this system . It is a great system for the money . When I compared this system with others of comparable features and price it had a much richer sound ( better highs ) . And , YOU CAN FastFoward WITH THE REMOTE . All you have to do is hold the Foward Skip button ( just like most CD players ! ) . This IS in the manual . My only complaint is that there is no RANDOM feature for listening to CDs and MP3s .  
2	  After loosing my battery charger for my Nikon camera I found out that Nikon doesn't carry the original charger any more - very disappointing , since the camera is only a few years old . I tried several off-brand chargers which just did not give the battery any charge . Then I found the exact Nikon charger that I lost on Amazon through PCMonde and it works great .  
2	  I actually got it for $ 7 at Ross but it is good at any price . Even though the ear clip part is a bit flimsy , it doesn't pinch your ears like other earclips . I sat watching tv for about 2 hours and forgot I even had them on ! They are great ! I tried jogging about the house in them , and the only thing moving was the cord . They are very stable in your ears and they come with two extra pair of earbuds ( just in case ) . I would def . recommend these .  
1	  I had a very bad experience with this product . I was able to get it to work with one drive in the unit . When I tried to install the second drive , I could not net it to recognize the full storage . I had this running on a home network with NetGear powerline carrier . Guess what , they are incompatible . I found that after I installed the software on my Vista and XP Pro machines , I could not get a clean shutdown . I kept getting an error message that there was a mirroring conflict when I tried to install it on a third machine . I finally ended up uninstalling the software and taking the SC101 offline . I no longer had the shutdown problem . Bad news ..  
2	  This is a great radio . Light weight , small , easy to cary or attach to exercise clothing . Provides great sound and awesome color screen is easy to read at various light levels . I also bout the specialty headphones for this unit and am very impressed . They improve overall reception and sound great . Very easy set up is a bonus .  
2	  This is my 2nd set of these Sony headphones - having lost the originals in a recent home move . They are especially comfortable to wear - easily adjustable and VERY light . I use them for audible text using an Amazon kindle reader , so the sonic range , for my use , is pretty constrained , That said , their performance has been excellent . I did not experience any loss of audio over time ( broken wires reported in other reviews ) but used them with reasonable care over the course of 18-20 months . I will certainly not stress the wire-to-headset connection knowing now that it may be a weak point . For the price , however , you can't go wrong . Highly recommended .  
2	  Missing a fifth star due to flimsy cap constantly falling off of the pen . Device works well to clean my lenses and the price was right .  
2	  This is the third time I have ordered this product . I would like to have one in each room of my home . This last one , however , was ordered for use as a Christmas gift . It is an outstanding product that you never even touch until the batteries need replacing , and you never worry about having the EXACT correct time .  
1	  False advertising , package claims Vista compatible but they have no drivers for x64 and if you read the replies people have gotten from reps at Microsoft they don't plan any . Good job supporting your own hardware and OS MS .  
2	  This is the best set I have ever owned and the ONLY set of in ear style headphone that don't fall out . I sweat ALOT and run ALOT and neither the moisture or the bouncing cause these things to fall out . I am going on 2 years with my first pair and they are still going strong . They must really safeguard these things against moisture . At the current price , you just can't beat these things . A must for the athlete who can't keep their headphones form slipping .  
1	  I already have an ipod mini but i thought it would be cool to have an ipod shuffle so i bought one and it sucks . It holds barley any songs and it doesn't have a screen . It 's so stupid . I didn't want it anymore so i gave to my friend . and she loves it i don't know why  
1	  I bought this cable thinking that all the VGA cables are the same . However my idea was wrong because I could learn that this cable doesn't support more than 1024 by 764 pixels . My computer monitor is 21 inches and if I use the VGA cable that came with the computer I have higher resolution options for the monitor display . When I use this VGA cable it gives monitor quality option only up to 1024 by 764 pixels . So if you have a bigger computer monitor or if you want to use this cable for a bigger screen I don't recommend this cable . Hope this helps !  
1	  I had the same experience as Wendy in Nebraska . The description is clearly of a computer case , and all I received was a power supply . I complained and Amazon sent me another power supply . I refused it , and will return the first one for a refund . Someone at Amazon should read the reviews and make some corrections . Newell Stallones  
1	  I had the same problems as everyone else who used this product . I had Version 1 for just under 90 days and worked with Level 1 tech support numerous times to get the thing steady . Tech support seemed to try to keep me trying things until I got to the 90 day point , at which time they seemed like they weren't going to help me . They kept asking me for the date that I bought it . I didn't want to get to the 90-day point , so I demanded a new router at about day 89 . They complied quickly ( no CC needed ) so at least they have that going for them . The original router 's problem wasn't that it rebooted , as other users reported . In my case , it simply didn't allow you to connect to the Internet by either not giving you a DHCP address when you started up or by just bombing out and freezing up at random times . The problem really could happen at any time . Sometimes it worked for 24 hours , sometimes for 2 minutes . You never knew when it was going to freeze up on you . If you power-cycled the router , all was well again . I quickly got a new unit from Netgear ( another V. 1 ) and the same problems quickly appeared . I followed hrd2k 's simple instructions ( set the preamble to long preamble vice automatic ) and now the system is stable for weeks at a time , which is as long as I 've tested it . I 'm satisfied with unit , but they definitely sold it with bugs . Auto 108-mode wouldn't work until a recent s / w update . That meant that the unit would only work in a mixed B and G environment at 54 Megabits . Also , the logs only monitor port 80 and only monitor outbound connections . If someone is using AOL IM or telnet on your system , you can't tell . Hey , if it 's a firewall , I would like to see what 's going out and trying to come in . The log only holds about 40 recent outbound connections , so it you surf for 5 to 10 minutes , the logs are overwritten . You can mail yourself the logs if you want before they 're overwritten , but most people won't care about this . If you want to see what your kids surfed today , they had better have been using port 80 and doing whatever within the past 5 minutes . So , with these kinds of problems and these limitations , why did I rate it a 2 instead of a 1 ? I like the fact that you can restrict access to certain MAC addresses and that the wireless range is better than the MR314 that it replaced . I also like the fact that you can reserve a DHCP address for a particular machine . This is handy for me because one of my machines shares a printer and I have the other network machines find that one by IP address . Anyhow , it 's now a nice unit thanks to hrd2k . I wish Netgear support knew about this fix . Hey , who would have suspected that changing something from automatic would fix it ? Good find , hrd2k , and thanks for publicizing it . You saved me some money by not having to purchase a Linksys or D-Link to replace it .  
1	  I received this strap and have decided to return it prior to actually using it . Although it appears well constructed , it is very rigid , wide in the area right at the neck and the inside surface isn't smooth - kind of wrinkled . Seems like it will be uncomfortable . Not well enough padded for the weight of DSLRs . Not worth the risk of not liking it after use for this price .  
1	  I always trusted Panasonic and thought this would be a nice birthday present for my brother however after having it professionally installed the sound could not be adjusted . So unless you could drive with your ear up next to the speaker it was pretty much useless . I won't trust the seller or panasonic again .  
2	  This bracket was easy to install and works great . It is a bit of a challenge getting the TV on the bracket , however , so be sure to have a strong adult with you to help when it 's time to hang the TV onto the wall bracket . I 'd buy another .  
1	  I spent many hours tring to connect my computer to the wirless router . I could not figure it out . Electronic cards going bad was the last thing I would suspect but I was not correct . The Card 1024 was my problem and I don't recommend buying one . I know electonics and this card failed me where other have not .  
2	  This backpack is great , there of good quality and plenty of padding for those bumps in life . the pocket could be positioned better and could be sized better . other than that great pack for your small note book computer .  
1	  STAY AWAY .. Way to bog for 13 " . It is bigger than the sleeve I use for my 15 " MBP . does not fit in my back pack like the 15 " and is useless . to return will be $ 12.95 shipping . add the 5.99 I paid to get it shipped to me , does not make it worth the return . wase of $  
2	  These speakers are simply amazing . Low volume , high volume , the speakers don't seem to care and will faithfully reproduce your music at whatever volume you choose . The ONLY negative is the lack of a power switch on the satellite speakers . It is on the sub . Highly recommended .  
2	  I ordered P362 and the seller shipped P363 , which is functionally the same but with a full-faced black grill giving it a more conservation look . Fine for me . These speakers replaced a pair of basic Klipsch Synergy F-10 's as the front pair on a 7.1 system . They deliver balanced sound with more accurate highs ( not as shrill ) and stronger mid-range than the Klipsch . Bass seems about the same . Dialogues in movies are clearer and mid-range is less strained on high volume . Bass is good but for movies , they do not replace a sub . I mistakenly watched Tron Legacy on two-channel and the bass was badly distorted out of the P363 's . Switching back to surround sound made me realize how much the sub was necessary . Overall , I would recommend these speakers to anyone of a budget , as I am . From my limited experience and reading many reviews , I think there are no finer sounder speakers at this price .  
2	  I bought this product to rescue the data on my hard drives after a PC of mine was struck by a power surge and refused to boot . I put my hard drives one by one into the enclosure and copied the entire contents of each drive onto the new PC HD . Will practice better data backup in the future . The install of the drive on the enclosure was not hard but was complicated by the tight fit of the ribbon connector . I thought I was going to break the black base connector on the CoolMax . I had to use what I thought was way too much pressure on the ribbon in order to get the screw holes to line up . This is hard to explain - try it - you will see what I mean . Anyway , nothing broke and the data on both drives were rescued . USB performance was acceptable . Unit did seem to get hot and this would worry me if I were going to leave the unit on for months at a time .  
2	  Solid stainless steel . Don't have to worry about this pot falling apart . Great price and fast shipping . Only problem would be the nose but it only last a min or so when the pressure is first building .  
2	  I bought this for my wife to use on her laptop . She has small hands so this was a perfect mouse . It tracks well and has a short cord which stays out of the way . If you want one for your desktop system get something else as the cable is VERY short .  
1	  I received this DVD / VCR combination for Christmas 2003 . It worked fine until February 2004 at which time the picture froze up and then further attempts to play a DVD would result in " Loading .. Loading .. Loading .. " but would never play the DVD . I called Samsung and was advised to bring the unit in to Sears for repair . After three weeks , Sears called to advise that it was ready for pickup . When I picked it up , they told me all it needed was a cleaning . I brought the unit home and on the second DVD we tried to watch it again froze up and no longer would read any DVD . I called Samsung again and they e-mailed me a shipping label , advising that if I sent the unit back they would replace it . I received the replacement and hooked it up .. it has the same problem ! It simply flashes " Loading .. loading .. loading .. " and will not play any DVD . I called Samsung again and they suggested I bring the refurbished unit that they sent me back in for repair ! Quite honestly , I want my money back and am totally unsatified with this product and am still dealing with the nightmare of trying to resolve it . In reading the past reviews , I see other problems similar to mine . I am not even sure if I can bring it back to Sears now since the new unit they sent me has " REFURBISHED " stamped on the box and they no longer carry this product . Samsung now wants me to send the unit back to them again , and I am trying like heck to just get my money back or a different new model . I am told that I will need to speak with a manager , but they can't seem to get one off the phone to speak with me and I am waiting for a call back . When I explained that a year is half over and my warranty is half expired , I wanted to know if I would get another 1 year warranty with the new unit and they are telling me no . Since the average life of this product seems to be about 6 months before it breaks , I am worried that it will happen again and I will be out of luck . I would suggest that you not buy this particular model . I WILL KEEP YOU POSTED AS TO HOW SAMSUNG DEALS WITH THIS SITUATION AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN RESOLVE THIS TO MY SATISFACTION .  
1	  After 6 hours , mine is only working as a wired adapter from the router to the stereo , but not as a ' wireless bridge ' . In wireless mode , sound is choppy and unacceptable . If you are a wireless network guru and must try this product , heed the advice in other reviews and dispose of the directions immediately ( especially if you have a router ) then expect frustration and disappointment for many hours . If you are expecting plug and play and are not a network wizard , I highly recommend another product .  
1	  Even on Hi-res settings pictures are blurry with no detail . ONly good for trying to claim lochness or bigfoot sightings as any picture taken is so blurry as to fuzz out whatever person is taking picture of . Definitely PASS on this item .  
1	  This product has been a nightmare for me . I purchased it new from Amazon and I was very happy with it at first . The screen was very bright for laptops of that era . It came with the usual battery and you were able to put a second battery in the futurebay . So I was able to run 6 hours without plugging in , something unheard of for laptops of that time period . After awhile , I started to notice the fan sounding very loud . It seems to have two speeds , normal and the turbo mode which is the laptop equivalent of a jet engine . It was so loud , that when I used it in the Mountain View library , I cleared out a wide berth around me . After a year when it was out of warranty I had the very typical problem reported of it overheating and shutting down after a few minutes and the computer was completely useless . Since I had a dual boot machine and it shutdown in Linux too I was able to ascertain that it was a hardware problem . Since it was out of warranty , I decided to take it to a local small repair shop called CompuRun as I like to support the little guy . This turned out to be a near fatal mistake . After paying him a couple of hundred dollars , he correctly determined that this was caused by the heatsink detaching from the processor . However , instead of getting the right repair kit sold by Compaq for this he jury-rigged by gluing the heatsink on , a solution that only lasted a few weeks . After I knew what the problem was I was able to determine from HP user forums the problem was very common and that HP actually had a retrofit kit for this problem . I then tried to contact HP support and tried to have them fix this problem for free since this in my opinion was a design defect . Staying on the line to HP support which is all in India is enough to drive anybody crazy . They put you on hold for a hour and then you get some guy in India who can't escalate a complaint to anybody . Just forget about calling the HP service line completely . I then wrote a letter to the president of HP at the time , Carly Fiorina and I ordered the repair kit . I got the repair kit which cost me something like $ 70 . The repair kit basically consists of a square of rubber very similar to what you would patch a flat bike tire with and four very long screws and four nuts to make sure it doesn't come off the processor like the original squareI then received a telephone call from a secretive group within the Silicon Valley HP that really handles customer problems . I told them the problem and without much hesitation they offered to pay the cost of this repair guy to put the square of rubber / heatsink on the processor . The story should have had a happy ending after the repair guy put the heat sink after charging me another of couple of hundred dollars , but that was just the beginning of a new nightmare . The CompuRun guy did not put the laptop back together solidly . After about a month , I had to bend the case to get it to power up . I brought it back to him again and after I argued with him extensively , he agreed to put it back together correctly . I think his idea of a warranty is a tail-light warranty . However , when I got it back from him after he tightened everything up , he claimed the backlite had just coincidently gone out by itself , he could not repair it . Now the laptop was completely useless once again . I then sent the laptop to authorized Compaq repair for about $ 40 service fee and they told me it would cost $ 700 to repair it . I decided that the whole computer was not worth that much . After about a year , I located Moniserve in Hayward which specializes in fixing LCD / Monitors . They told me that the inverter board was fried ( by my " friend " from CompuRun ) . They were able to locate an after market board and repair it for $ 110 . I still have a problem where all sounds on the machine sound like they are stuttering at the end of the sentences , but I can live with that ! So the bottom of line is if you have this repair problem contact HP in writing / calling directly to the president , use an authorized repair shop and stay away from CompuRun in Mountain View  
1	  i got one of these little kits at walmart for my dad 's 1996 f-150 xlt and there are no parts that fit it it only works for up to 91 f series trucks  
1	  I received a used filter with some dirty marks on it which I can't clean it . Really disappointed with what I received so I returned it .  
1	  I could not get these to form a single image of a star or planet because the two tubes are not exactly parallel . I do not know whether that was a quality control issue of the pair I had , or the overall quality specification is so poor that misalignment is typical . Mine went back . A properly aligned pair would be a considerable bargain . If you buy these , buy them from a place with a good return policy . Keep the packaging and invoice .  
1	  Tried some from Radio Shack and they did not work consistantly . Bought these at Best Buy thinking that they were a good " brand name . " They were completely useless . They would not even work in the same room . Get the powermid x-10s , they work great .  
2	  so this is your basic RAM , and it worked , nothing was of an issue . RAM is always evolving , and the older RAM gets expensive . I think this was a good deal .  
2	  I 've had the EI - 2000 for about 6 months now and have shot approx 1000 shots with it - I have only had to recharge the batteries 3 times total - very , very good on battery power ( prob likely due to the SLR which means you don't chew up battery power looking at what you 're going to shoot ) . Photo quality is superb . Functionality is great - you can use as point and shoot or it also has the ability to totally control the shot if you want . Neatest feature is the Jetsend function - point at a printer , press a button , and the current photo prints . Can't say enough good things about this camera .  
1	  The hood actually made it more difficult to see the LCD . It was much more effective to just turn so the LCD was in my own shadow . The rubber eye-cup fell off frequently . Eventually , after falling off three times over the course of one hour , I lost in it some tall grass .  
2	  I have had my Zen Vision M now for a month or so-It has the most amazing audio quality , AND the LCD screen is Gorgeous ! The videos look so true to life ! The colors are High Def and so Beautiful . I 've had alot of Mp3 players to date but this one is just out of this world ! Please consider buying this one-I only wish it came with an even bigger hard drive-WOW ! I 've purchased my second Zen Vision M yesterdy ! I am truly hooked ! I transfer my Tivo recordings to my zen and I sit back and watch extraordinary colors and sound ! I 've had a Dell , an iRiver , a Rio 600 , Rio 800 , creative nano and now the zen vision M ( 2 ) . So far it is my pick for the best player out there ! Everyone complains about scratches but to date I have none-just keep your player it the soft pouch supplied with your zen vision , you 'll be fine ! I haven't tried an ipod yet-and I may never-The zen vision M is truly a WINNER in my book !  
2	  I 'm in the financial bracket that doesn't usually allow me to spend lots of " toy " money . So when I was shopping for a home theatre system , I had to be very picky . I spent countless hours in audio showrooms and listened to just about every combination of audio equipment known to man . I even had the pleasure of hearing some Mcintosh A / V equipment ( that was only a pipe dream though ) . If price is not a factor , there are a lot better speakers available . However , if you 're like most people and don't have an endless supply of cash lying around , you will be hard pressed to find speakers in this price range that reproduce sound so well . I purchased an entire JBL Venue series 6.1 setup with these being my front right and front left channels . I use them for listening to music , watching movies ( and television ) , and playing video games . They perform superbly on all fronts , and always amaze anybody that listens to them with the clarity they have at peak range . I 'm the kind of person that likes it loud , and this is where they realy shine . You can realy pour the power on these things and it seems like they just keep asking for more . I can't say enough about the clarity of the sound reproduction at very high levels . If you 're looking for a home theatre system that won't break the bank , but sounds like you did . The JBL Venue series fits the bill . P.S. If you like floor shaking low range performance , I highly reccomend an independant JBL 10 " or 12 " sub box . One of these will greatly enhance your experience while watching movies . All said I spent around $ 2500 ( including my A / V receiver ) and couldn't be happier . My Dad is still listening to a set of JBL L-65 's he bought in 1978 , If mine last that long they 're worth twice the money .  
2	  I use this for switching input devices between my target-display-mode capable iMac and a Windows machine with a displayport video card . Works great . The box is very light , so instead of using the included stand ( which slides off of the switchbox ) I attached it to my keyboard tray using velcro .  
2	  Last just as long as the original battery . I can shoot all day ( w flash ) and have plenty left over .  
1	  I purchased this H10 20Gb at full price . It stopped working within 30 days and IRiver refused to honor their warranty . They gave me the runaround for an entire year until the warranty ran out . Now it 's a $ 300 piece of junk . THIS PRODUCT AND IT 'S MANUFACTURER ARE NOT RELIABLE .  
2	  It 's a reliable mp3 player , not expensive , for those who are looking for a cheap way to listen music  
1	  D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigbit Wireless Router does not provide any better performance than an entry level Linksys ; do not waste your money on this product .  
2	  Very good disks that are dependable and reliable . You definitely get your money 's worth for recordingwith such clarity that you will want to buy theseand no other kind of disk .  
1	  So what if the resolution is spectacular or the battery life is decent if the M515 turns on at the slightly touch or bump and inevitably drains the battery , rendering the M515 nothing but dead weight in my purse or briefcase ? My M515 is " protectected " by a leather case from none other than Palm . There are two little bars across the bottom of the case that are supposed to prevent the front half of the case from pressing on the buttons across the bottom of the M515 . BUT THEY DON'T WORK . If you put the slightest amount of pressure on the case , the M515 turns on and eventually drains the battery . I just carry around ( never toss or drop ) my purse or briefcase . Maybe the problem is solved by having a hard case but I 'm sickened and angered by how Palm can market the M515 without being honest and upfront about the ridiculous feather-touch turn on feature or the requirement for a hard case . I used to be a Palm loyal . Now I hate Palm . I wish I had realized the problem within the return period . Otherwise , I would not be left with a useless piece of junk . If I 'm missing something , like some trick to lock the keys , someone PLEASE let me know . The M515 is driving me nuts .  
2	  This tiny camera is perfect for keeping with you at all times , just in case of a celeb sighting , cute kid trick - whatever flips your lid . The Flip is a $ 100 product , so don't expect high-quality video or audio - it doesn't like too much movement and forget about taping stuff more than 6 feet away . But , as long as you keep this in mind and long as your lighting is good - natural light or BRIGHT indoor light , you 'll be good to go . Another reviewer mentioned incompatibility with certain USB ports . I happen to have side-mounted USB ports on my Macbook Pro , so I had no problem plugging in the Flip . Yet another reviewer mentioned some ideas for improving the camera . Sure , I have some improvements in mind too , but at 100 bucks , I can't complain too much . My dislikes ? I had to press down pretty hard to make the zoom work . This is a minor quip , since the 2x digital zoom is SO not worth even using . Zoom with your feet , people . The other dislike isn't with the camera itself . I don't mind so much that there 's no lens cap , but the cheap velveteen bag provided with the camera tends to shed , so I have had to blow the fabric fuzz off of the lens every time I use it . I 'm not going to comment on the editing software since I haven't used it . Tres cute ! Tres handy . Tres fun .  
1	  TOTAL waste of your money to purchase this . You have to send the appliance back for repairs , which takes 7 days there , 7 days before evaluation , and 7 days return . Add another five days for parts . You pay for shipping to them to boot ! Assumes that they actually get your appliance in one piece as well , which did not happen for me . DO NOT buy this .  
2	  I purchased a 30gb iPod Vid . some time ago . To start off , I have to say it 's great looking . The sound quality is amazing - I hook it up to my home theater system and it produces amazing sound quality and bass . The click wheel is super easy and is convenient for extended use - everything is right there . The quality of the graphics is very impressive - super bright and clear . With Videora iPod converter ( free ) , you can download or rip DVD 's and place ANY video file from ANY source by transcoding it . Now the Cons : This product is delicate . It is in no way " extreme " or " sporty " . Imagine you are buying a gem . This in fact is so delicate , that I would say that you might as well burn your $ 300.00 than buy one WITHOUT FIRST buying a cover or case . DO NOT USE THIS without buying a case please . I tell you this from experience . The 1st iPod video I bought was so scratched by the 3rd day , that you could no longer view your videos in acceptable quality . I ended up exchanging it some how ( hard thing to do ) , and getting a new one . BUT I didnt dare to use it until I bought a case by the brand " zcover " ( In my opinion , the best case out there - very usefull and protective ) . Basically , it 's being fragile is the only problem I found to it . Another thing is that I would go with the white iPod , which seems to show finger prints and scratches much less than the black . Overall , it really is worth it . IF you buy a cover with it . I use it at the gym , when I go out to run , in the car - everywhere . Its really light and given the fact that it has 30GB , i 'd say it pretty small . In my opinion , there is no other MP3 out in the market right now that matches the iPod video .  
1	  I expected more from Samsung . I bought this player with good hope from a brand I though I trusted . Now two months into having it , the DVD drive is broken . It will not let me bring up the menu screen to program the VCR to record a show or anything , and now I put in a DVD and it wont even play that . All I get now is a shakey blue screen of death . Ill be getting this back to the store I bought from very quickly and purchasing a different brand completely . Stay Away from Samsung !  
2	  Forget about carrying your zip drive around . This device can hold 256 MB , and fits in your pocket . At home , you can use this device to store all of your personal private files instead of your hard drive . When you 're done saving , viewing , and manipulating your personal files , you can simply put the drive in your pocket and take your files with you . That way , even if you share your computer , no one else can access your files . Your files will be safe even if someone steals your computer . This method is more secure than keeping your private files in your hard drive , no matter the security settings you have on there . The best way to keep your files private is to simply not store them on your computer . Instead , use a device like this and take your files with you . This device is so small that you can keep , secure , or hide it just about anywhere . In appearance , it looks like a small highlighter . I highly recommend this storate device to anyone who is interested in maximum privacy , security , and portability .  
1	  I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing . The combination of Amazon and the service plan company represent a beauracratic nightmare that ( it would seem ) seeks to obstruct the customer in every way . I have been lied to multiple times and have had to prove over and over again to the service company that yes I made the purchase yes I sent it back correctly , yes I bought a service plan , and more . Do not bother to buy this service plan . If you do buy service plan anyway , make sure you ; keep every scrap , invoice , original packaging , use usps delivery confirmation . Follow their rules . If you don't keep EVERYTHING that you can that refers to your purchase you will probably be screwed . I still haven't had my service plan honored and I have all the information they want . It seriously feels like they are trying rip off the costomer . I hope you read and believe this review .  
2	  I am very pleased with my purchase from Amazon . com . I had researched the different tv 's with consumer reports and this tv lives up to its ratings . I have never purchased something so valuable online and would recommend amazon . com for any purchase ! It was a great transaction !  
1	  I opted for this service plan for a Creative Vision M MP3 player I purchased from Amazon in April 2006 . It 's a great MP3 player , however it stopped being recognized by Windows XP . I contacted N.E.W. and was promptly sent a return mailer . The item was shipped to Lifetime Service Center in New York early last month . I received a post card confirming receipt of the player a few days later stating it would be repaired in ten days or a tech would contact me if repairs could not be completed . When I didn't hear anything after three weeks I called the service center . The customer service rep curtly informed me the player had been returned to Creative for repair and to wait another six to eight weeks . So much for follow up on their part ! After having read other negative reviews for this rip off , I get the feeling I should have simply gone to Best Buy to purchase this player to begin with . I 'll provide an update when and if my MP3 player is ever returned to me . 4/03/08 UPDATE - Tried to contact N.E.W. via email , but still have not responded after two months . Have called several times , the last being a couple of days ago . After being told each time Creative had the MP3 player and would repair it , they finally told me four months had passed and would be sending me a check for the full purchase price of the player . Hmm .. I was told each time I contacted them to wait two weeks ! I 'm curious to see if they indeed send me a check . 4/08/08 UPDATE - Received phone call from Amazon customer service today stating they will be sending a check within 10-15 days . 4/15/08 CONCLUSION - Received check today from N.E.W. , went to the Apple Store purchased an 80gb iPod Classic and Apple warranty . Hopefully I have better luck this time . Five months later .. if you purchase this warranty be prepared to make plenty of phone calls , as they will not contact you regarding the status of your repair . I have a feeling if it weren't for my regular phone calls , my situation would never been resolved .  
1	  It works fine , I can't compare it to the ipod but I 'm very disappointed in the lack of accessories available . I would like to find a car adapter so I can listen to it in the car longer than the short time the battery lasts . I have found nothing available ! Amazon lists it as discontinued and when I called Creative , they told me it was discontinued and they have no idea when a new one will be available . There is no cradle available either . Go into a store like Best Buy and you 'll see a wide variety of accessories available for ipod . Ipod cost more but I 'm very sorry I didn't buy one now since it seems that Creative is doing nothing to make accessories availably .  
1	  Graphics . Okay . Buttons and remote .. okayPeripheral capability .. looks good but sucksSoftware / firmware .. crappyUser manual .. crappyWhat Kodak should have provided was a software program that could be used to easily crop and size your photos to fit the 800x480 size . The frame did not even acknowledge when I plugged in a KODAK compactflash ! What pooty-doo ! Look around and compare before you buy this .  
2	  There is a wide price range for laptop carrying cases . I wanted something relatively inexpensive because I won't use it a lot . Wanted to take my laptop on vacation . I was very happy with the quality of the bag & the # of storage areas it offers . Very good buy for the price .  
1	  These fit in my ears and sound great . BUT the loops go completely OVER my ear . When I go running they constantly fall out . I 'll post a photo shortly .  
1	  I have the same problem . The printer won't print black ink . Half the time it won't print at all . When it does , the quality of the other colors is terrible . The black ink cartridge is nearly full . This is the second black ink cartridge , and I 've probably printed less than 20 pages since I bought this printer . I will never buy another epson product .  
1	  I bought this modem because there was a $ 30 manufacturer mail-in rebate and because so many on this website praised it . Here are the problems I found with this modem : 1 . When I send a fax using the Rapidcomm software included on the CDrom , after a few hours I find nothing works ; I cannot send another fax or even connect to the internet . errors " no dial tone " or " the port is already open " . Worse , I cannot kill the offending processes because they pop right back up . Tried switching off / on the modem . Not even a computer reboot would do it . I actually had to power down / up the computer to make it work . 2 . It would often disconnect me from the internet ( my ISP is MSN ) . 3 . The Internet update wizard meant to update the modem somehow cannot dial the 3Com server . So I went to the website usr . com to see if I could download upgrades but found the inf file for this modem is o . l . d . ! ( 1998 ) . I could not believe it . 4 . What is worst is when I called technical support ( case # 1728933 ) , I was on hold for one hour and hold your breath - there is no toll free number provided - it is a long distance call . 5 . The uninstaller does not remove all files eg . file ' usrwiz ' . So when you reinstall the Connections software , you have to know the specific file names to delete otherwise a reinstall will not work .  
1	  I 'm experienced with networking , as I have 5 computers networked in my home . This product kept cutting out my internet connection every 18 minutes . So any java type application , etc . would stop and I would have to reconnect mirc , aol , realtick type apps . ( .. ) I RETURNED THIS ITEM !  
1	  Having an ever-growing DVD / TV collection I was looking for something to get them out of a stack in the corner . Purchased this item and it was easy to assemble and looked quite nice , and it didn't take up a whole lot of room as it was quite tall . However within a month the plastic diamond sides completely snapped down one side rendering it 100 % unusable and unfixable !  
1	  I agree with one of the other more recent reviews . Overall , I have been extremely pleased with my Kensington products . They work well with my multiple Macs and also Windows-based PCs . I bought an earlier version of this desktop wireless set ( K64382 ) , which worked well for about two years and then began to malfunction - primarily a few keys that either wouldn't function or only every now and then . I contacted Kensington , and they informed me that they didn't have that set , which I 'd purchased via Amazon ( where I buy nearly all of my electronics and plenty of other products ) . However , under their five-year warranty , they told me that they 'd send me a new set , i.e. , this one ( K64390US ) . It 's fantastic . I couldn't even use the other one where I wanted to use it , which was with my Mac Mini that 's connected to our plasma TV in our bedroom ( reception wasn't very good , which resulted in using it directly in front of my iMac ) . With the new set , it works perfectly with my Mac Mini setup , allowing me to use the wireless keyboard and mouse about ten feet away . I 've experienced no issues whatsoever with the new set , which seems even more responsive as well . I would definitely recommend it as well as the Kesington brand due to my support experience . Sept . 8 , 2011 : This is an update to my original May 3 , 2010 review ( awarded 4 stars at that time ) . This newer set worked well until recently . Then it completely stopped working . It seems like a software issue . However , when I contacted Kensington , they informed me that they haven't updated and don't plan to update this MouseWorks-type software . I 've purchased several Kensington products for Mac over the years , but don't plan to purchase anything else in the future . Logitech seems to have some of the best Mac-oriented keyboards and mice . I 'm disappointed in Kensington 's apparent decision . Their newer iPad keyboard has received good reviews , but I 'd approach with caution based on my experiences with these full-sized desktop sets .  
1	  I 've ordered these for years and had few to no coasters per 100 pack . The recent pack I ordered I haven't been able to burn a single one . Why would they work in my Plextor burner before and not now ? You can't say the media isn't supported by my burner . Unfortunately , I threw away the wrapper , but I am deducing these are made in another country - India ? Malaysia ? I very much doubt they are the same TDK -R discs I used to order . I 've recently tried Verbatim discs and have no problems burning them . Just want to warn others that if you liked these in the past , you might not like them now . Better check the label when they arrive to see where they were made . If it says Taiwan , I think you should be ok . If not , don't throw out the packaging , but try burning one disc . If that fails , you could try a few more . But then send them back . It 's terrible when a trusted company fails like this . :-(  
2	  very inexpensive HTIB , but for the price I was impressed with the sound I got from it . Pros : 1 . Setup is extemely easy . 2 . Powerful sound .. I have mine set up in a room that 's about 30X15 . Butwe use one half of the area as the TV viewing area , so the surround sound field is about 15X15 . With that said I cannot put the volume past 27 ( goes to 50 ) without blowing out a eardrum . 3 . The subwoofer works well . I can feel the sofa vibrating . 4 . The speakers are pretty adequate and give out a nice sound . 5 . You can adjust the volume for rear speakers , front speakers and center . Cons : 1 . The remote buttons are a bit small2 . It only has pre-set equalization . Doesn't matter to me for movies , but I would have liked it for the radio . 3 . Even though it has a usb port on it , it does not read all mp3 players , specifically it won't read my ipod . If your looking for a nice inexpensive HTIB I would recomend this to anyone .  
2	  Not the best product out there , but for the price , it was worth it . I 've had it for about a month now and it rarely ejects itself . The sound quality is not the best , but again , good for its price . Overall , I haven't had any major problems with it and am very satisfied .  
1	  My Micromemo showed up today , and on first glance it 's a really sharp , well-designed product . Then I plugged it into my Nano . It 's two hours later , the Nano is locked up , and won't respond to any key commands . iTunes won't recognize it . Apparently the only solution is to let the iPod battery run down and reformat it with iTunes . This means I 've lost the use of the iPod for several days - assuming this works . Thanks , Micromemo . I 'll be mailing it back tomorrow .  
2	  It 's important to me if a produce is easy to use so I won't get tired of using it soon . I 've had this for a long time . It works beautifully . No problem ever . Simple to use . Plug it in and there are the pictures .  
1	  I was going to be wrapping this up giving this as a gift to my sister . Instead I bought something else for her since the packaging was so awful . The packaging was torn in places the plastic cover crunched and scratched so bad that you can barely see the product . It was perfectly wrapped in brown shipping paper so it must of been this way before shipment very disappointing . I will probably still give it to her but not as a christmas gift :(  
1	  I 'm having poor results with this device . It 's simple and intuitive to set up , although I 'm a little confused about some of the comments here concerning a stand or cradle . Mine didn't have anything like that . It 's very difficult to use the switch on the front to change from one computer to the other - the switch is cantankerous and touchy . And even when it is working - it allows the two computers to communicate with the PRINTER , but not with the SCANNER . For that , I have to unplug and rearrange cables . Overall , this was a waste . It 's caused as much frustration as it 's eliminated . Equipment : desktop PC , Mac laptop , HP photosmart printer  
2	  When I find something that works , and works well on a consistent basis , I continue to use it . I 've had no coasters , as of yet ! Further I use TDK VHS tapes as well as TDK Minidv tapes .  
2	  These headphones are a terrific bargain . I looked thru the selection at Best Buy , then I came back to amazon . The sound quality is excellent . The head band is adjustable . The headphones stay on my head , even when I 'm laying in bed . Highly recommend .  
1	  Our family loved the remote at first , but after a couple weeks the remote becomes more of a hassle than it is helpful . It seems to lose it 's programming or just decides not to turn equipment off and on in the proper sequence . If you reprogram it , it will work great for a bit longer , but then starts getting retarded again . We have switched back to the original remotes now .  
1	  Adorama Camera will pull a fast one on you and send you a cheap knock-off , which , even though it 's a simple enough product , is built like crap . In order to get the flash shoe to fit , the thumb screw has to be backed all the way out , which then causes the tiny springs to fall out . If you 're not careful then the spacer on the thumb screw , which I think is the culprit being slightly too long , will also fall off . Adorama wants the parts returned in new condition for a refund , HA !  
1	  THIS PRODUCT ALONG WITH ALL PYLE PRODUCTS ARE JUNK . ON TOP OF THE PRODUCTS BEING TERRIBLE .. YOU SHOULD CONTACT THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE . BELIEVE ME , WHEN YOU HAVE TO CONTACT THEM ( BECAUSE THEIR PRODUCTS ARE TERRIBLE ) YOU WILL SEE THAT THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS EQUALLY HORRIBLE . AVOID AND GO WITH ANY OTHER PRODUCT !  
1	  I had this router for several years in a small apartment . Had many problems with dropped connections and router needing to be power cycled . Replaced it with aLinksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router ( Compatible with Linux ) with firmware upgraded to DD-WRT which performs flawlessly . I regret spending so much time and effort trying to get the Netgear WGR614 to work reliably .  
2	  I 've tried other brands of DVD 's and they do not meet the qualifications that I need in a DVD . Fugi allows me to make a CD / DVD and play it in all three of my components that I use , including my car . The other brands would not do this . Work in some but not in all . I 've stuck with Fugi for years and will continue to do so .  
2	  The book for the camera is available online , but difficult to understand unless you know all the technical jargon . For the price , it is excellent , a great camera for us to learn on . But the pixels are too few for really excellent shots .  
2	  I had 3 digital cameras , that was the first one . I had also casio z40 and kodak ls743 . I would never get rid of 4330 , but I could not stand battery life .. I had 4 2000mah and I had to charge them all the time .. the other thing was size of this camera , kinda big , and that cover / cap .. But the pictures was incerdibly good , colors were natural , super pix in low light .. I hope I find similar quality camera with diferent kind of battery .  
1	  These cartridges must be factory rejects . The 3 colors in this cartridge are supposed to be red , blue , and yellow . Mine had orange instead of yellow . No wonders they are cheaper here . DON'T BUY !  
1	  I ordered this product on 12/15/05 . I got a knock off brand . The box not only says video camera battery ( then it also states its " for Nikon EN-EL3 " ) , it isn't what is pictured above . The battery has no label for it being of the Nikon brand , and no writing on the front of the battery . It only has " for Nikon " printed on the back along with its origin ( cell from Japan , made in China ) . It is a 7.4v but you are getting a 1500mah and not a 1400mah ( I don't know if that part is a big concern , just falsely advertised ) . I have contacted the seller for a refund . Is it reliable although it has a 12month warranty . Any comments on this , please ? I don't know what this brand is called , it just says " Video Camera Battery , Lithium Ion High Energy " and that 's it ? ! ? ! I would beware , what you see is not what you get ! Although , the knock off could be as reliable , who knows ? If someone else has had this problem , but kept the battery , did it work fine for you ? ThanksUPDATE 12/27/05 : Seller contacted me and said it was a mistake , that " After looking at your order i noticed are battery was on a nikon page . It was never suppose to be on that page and i am sorry , that is are fault . But i can guarantee you that the battery you have will work just as good as Nikon brand " I appriciated the honesty and I believe they are working to correct the issue . Therefore I am going to keep it for the price and I hope all goes well . UPDATE 12/27/08 : Three years later and still kicking . I 'm glad I kept it . I would like update the stars to 4 since it 's lasted so long .  
1	  I am not sure why I expected more from a $ 20 pair of headphones , but I did . I just got these a few hours ago and I could tell as soon as I took them out of the package that they are very cheaply made . They have the classic " Made in China " markings and the build quality owns up to their title . I was looking for a decent pair of headphones to use with my Imac while my roommate practices the drum . I am no audiophile so I am not to picky about sound quality . I will mostly be using the headphones with games and movies , but also the occasional music . I tested the phones with a variety of music and the sound meets my standards . Sharp highs , quick bass response ( a little lacking though in power in the lows ) . BUILD : - Very cheap plastic-I feel like I am going to break them-they came with " weak " looking lines in some of the plastic-ear fabric is paper thin-buttons incredibly cheap and do not click in place-inadequate 2 piece headband design . COMFORT : - The headband hurts the top of my head when wearing them . - The ear padding is big enough to surround my ear and IS comfortable . - They are very light-the wire comes out one side and is niceSOUND : -a little muffled in the mids-quick bass response but not very powerful-highs are the perfect amount of sharp , not ear piercingI wish I had an extra $ 20 or so to buy a better pair . SHould have bought the Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones or similar that look to have much better build quality . I would not recommend these headphones .  
1	  Bought this for my son for college , initially sound quality was great , in fact his brothers would use it for outdoor parties etc . Then something went amiss and the the unit kept shutting down . Tried to troubleshoot and that did not work . It is now in garbage :-( So , it only lasted about 1 year . Looking for another and hope it lasts longer .  
2	  I LOVE this camera . Unfortunately it was stolen out of my purse last weekend as I walked around Amsterdam . With it were all of my pictures and videos ( 4 gb worth - about 1000 shots ) from my first and only trip to Europe . Needless to say , I am more upset about losing the pictures than anything , but I am also upset about losing this wonderful camera . I had it for about 1 and 1/2 years and I used it all the time . I just replaced it with the 770 , which is not even the newest model offered ( they have an 880 now ) , but the Orange color is disappointingly no longer available . I ordered the 770 because it looked like " Blazing Red " might actually be orange , but it 's not . I also had the issue with this camera freezing a few times when I 'd been using it a lot and turning it frequently on and off . Popping out and then putting the battery back in fixed the problem every time . I am also having a problem with video-compatibility on my Mac Book ( the avi format that Casio used is apparently incompatible with iPhoto and Quicktime , but I am working on a solution ) . Other than that , I have no complaints . The pictures are crystal-clear and the camera is super easy to use !  
1	  Only one screen protector in an order . Very slightly ( about 1 mm . ) too wide for the screen of my XV-6700 , so it 's hard to put on . Scratches easily ( even the smoothing card that came with it scratched it ) . Not visibly or tactilely better than any other screen protector I 've used over the years , but also no worse . On the plus side , comes with disposable little finger-gloves ( like little balloons or condoms ) you can wear to prevent fingerprints during installation . Had not seen that before .  
2	  I would have given it a five star if I hadn't just tested the Bose . But I don't think anything can compare to the Bose . That being said , even after going back and forth , comparing them , I don't regret my decision . The Bose were super expensive . These were almost as good , and just about as effective . The Bose ear cup sealed better , slightly more comfortable , and you couldn't hear the noise from the cancelling effect at all . It also cancelled noise just a tiny bit better , probably because of the tighter seal . It felt like it was suctioning onto my ear , but didn't hurt . That being said , this one compared to the uber expensive one pretty darn well . I got it for less than a fifth of the price , and they are comfortable , cancel sound extremely well , ( made my first flight with them * much * more pleasant even though I didn't have any music , ) and have pretty darn good sound quality . The biggest difference was the sound quality , I think . I didn't know what I was missing until I listened to the Bose , and when I have disposable income , might even buy a set of the Bose , but these serve their function perfectly . Also , as an added bonus , these , ( but not the Bose ) , will function as headphones when turned off , thus not wasting battery when you don't need to cancel noise and want to have some sense of your surroundings . Though , it 's still pretty hard to hear anything when they 're on , even without the noise cancelling on . They block noise when off even when there 's no music playing , which I think is a sign of good noise isolation . Here 's what you should expect , and what I was pleasantly surprised about : - Noise cancelling noise : In all the noise cancelling headphones I 've ever tried , you can tell when they 're on not because everything 's quiet ( though that 's a factor too ) but because you can * feel * it . In these , when there 's no music , you can also hear it faintly . It feels weird , and it can start to bother me after a while , but they all have it . It 's because of the way noise cancelling works . - Comfort : You want a good tight fit so it seals , but I 'm someone who is used to earbuds . Putting anything * on * my ears was hard to get used to , and it can feel heavy and uncomfortable after a while . That being said , I didn't think these pinched , and they fit pretty well . - Noise cancelling ability : These are meant to cancel ambient noise . I find that they do a better job when you 're stationary , and facing in certain directions , which makes sense considering how the technology works . They are better with lower frequencies ( planes , cars , fans ) , and worse with higher frequencies ( voices ) . So , don't expect to not be able to hear the person talking next to you with these or any noise cancelling headphones . That being said , when I was also playing music , I couldn't hear the person next to me unless I was trying really hard . Me and a friend played around , talking to each other while we had these and the Bose on . When just the noise cancelling ( no music ) was on , then we could hear each other but it was dampened , softer , easier to ignore . With the music on , I could imagine someone talking to me and not knowing it . So , don't expect magic , but do expect very quality noise reduction .  
1	  The screen is the exact size of my display area but the little sticky tabs they give with it are all but useless . You 'd do better with scotch tape to hold it in place . In my opinion a waste of money .  
2	  This belt clip is simple but just what I was looking for . It is easy to use and does the job . I had a hard time finding one , but it was worth the wait ..  
2	  I got this card for my Canon FS 100 . It has enough memory to record memories with my little baby girl . This is why I will give a 5 stars review .  
2	  IM 75 years old and have had a ton of popcorn poppers in my life timeNever have I had one that I like moreTook a couple times to figure out the time to let it pop on my Microwave but I know nowPops everything just fine . I do use orville though  
2	  I paid only about $ 30 for this printer from a guy on eBay , but it was brand new , unopened and worked perfectly from initial setup . The photos we have printed ( mostly on Canon paper ) have easily equalled those we had done by CVS and Walmart in the past . The day to day printing is flawless too . The ink is dirt cheap here on Amazon ( Subscribe and Save and never buy refilled ! ) which makes the TCO for this very reasonable . I would recommend this to anyone , except I imagine it has been discontinued by now .  
1	  I borrowed one of these for a week and was hoping it woulld be a little better than this for the price , especially as this is a company from Korea . But the navigation was quite difficult and it seemed a bit slow for a hard drive device . It also doesn't recognize Windows files . While the battery life was quite good it still seems more like an iPOD imitation - without the easy navigation - than a device which will break its own new ground . Combine this with sound quality that is average at best and it 's safe to say I 'll stick with Apple for the next while . You just can't beat that scroll wheel . I 'd suggest iRiver ( imitation even of the iPOD name ? ) stick with what it does best , flash memory machines .  
2	  This bulb for my Double Durby DJ light did the job . It has lasted for more than a year now so that is all good for me . I was very satisfied with the purchase .  
1	  I bought this pretty much because of the Monster name . It had static everywhere on every station . I live in an area with plenty of free stations . Refund !  
2	  This fan came shipped in it 's original box , not within another box which was fine , saves on packaging . The item was easy opening and although it came with instructions I didn't need them to assemble due to minimal parts and common sense . The fan is not really a hard plastic , and the guard is also made of plastic but it is fairly quiet and really throws a lot of wind so I 'm satisfied . Will it last ? Time will tell . I think if it falls over it may be prone to breaking since it 's all plastic .. just don't tip it over .  
1	  Linksys by Cisco Wireless-G Print Server with Multifunction Printer SupportThis device is very confusing to set up . There are multiple steps of " unplug this , now plug in that , then unplug the first thing , now do this , etc . " And they must be done in order , or you have to start over again . There 's no going back one or two steps . If you get an error message or the program can't immediately find your network or the router it crashes . And beware that when it asks for the WEP key and invites you to create one DON'T , because unless you use the key already on your router you won't be able to connect . Then when I got through all the rigamarole finally and went to install the driver on my computer I found that apparently Cisco never heard of Windows 7 . I got a poorly translated message ( must originally been in Chinese ) which told me that the OS was " no " supported . I went to the Cisco website assuming that there 'd be an updated driver for Windows 7 , but no mention of it , only Vista and XP . So for me the device is completely useless . And anyway I was hoping to add my wife 's Mac to the server , but once again , no support . Bottom line , be VERY careful about ordering this device !  
1	  I did like the headset . Though it was more bulky it seemed more comfortable on the ears than other headsets . The mic quality received positive feedback from others on ventrilo . Unfortunately after 30 days the right side of the headset went out . It was the headset and not my computer as I also tried to use it on my other computer with the same results . Personally I recommend the logitech head sets . I bought one for my son who uses a head set as much as I do and he has never had an issue with his . Like an idiot I didnt think he head set would go out so I threw all the packaging and rma paper work out . Well live and learn I suppose .  
1	  I purchased these and tried many different configurations ; you are give a variety of little pieces yuo can use to customer the " fit : to your ear . Bottom Line : the did not fit any better or worse than any other ear buds that I have owned .  
1	  While this case is listed here as fitting both Palm II and Palm VII organisers , the packaging only mentions the Palm II . Sure enough , the Palm VII is just a little longer than the Palm II , so this case does not fit my Palm VII . Back in the box ..  
2	  Again Sony still is the best choice if you are looking for small and comfortable headphone . Again I recommend it  
2	  Pros : DD-WRT and Tomato compatible . If you do not know what they are , google it and spend some time reading up on it . USB port , great for sharing printers and HDDs on your home wireless networkBy far the easiest router to install Tomato on ( from wikibooks ) : 1 . If the device has OEM firmware version 3 . x or later , then you need to revert it to a pre-3 . x version , first . 2 . Downloading and unpack the " ND " version of Tomato firmware , rename the file to " WL520gu_2.0.0.9_EN . trx " . 3 . Use the OEM menus to update the firmware with the renamed Tomato file . Cons : OEM Firmware is terribleNeed to use CUPS drivers for Mac and / or Unix / Linux peopleRouter runs slow every once in awhileOEM router is terrible . UI looks like crap and and it runs like crap . USB printing was spoty and the router internet connection would drop every 5 mins with the Asus FW . Most people who bought this router bought it for its DD-WRT capabilities and the USB port . If you do not plan to flash it , go find another router that is more stable . Once flashed , however , this router is just amazing . It does what ever you want with DDWRT , Tomato or any other open firmware . You can share the USB port over your network . I usually share a laser printer on it , and I am able to print whereever I want in my house . USB HDD 's work too if you want to have a networked drive . The only real downside is that if you do use it as a print server with Macs , make sure the drivers are CUPS drivers . Build quality is ok for the router , its not heavy and doesnt feel substantial . Antenna is removable . There are slots on the bottom for wall mounting . Bottom line , this is a great router for the price to convert in a super router if youre willing to spend 5 mins reflashing the firmware .  
1	  I purchased this Rollei about 18 months ago as a replacement for an Olympus Zoom that I had enjoyed for several years . After many rolls of film the camera was stolen on a recent vacation , and I was almost glad ! The Scheider optics that the Rollei literature brags about did not translate into quality pictures . The contrast was low and flat , and the flash exposures were pitiful compared to the lost Olympus . The controls and settings were confusing and forced me to carry the manual for a long time in order to be sure I would know how to operate the camera and I never did master it . I have been a amatuer photographer for 30 years and own 2 Nikon FE bodies and an assortment of Nikon lenses . I understand the fundamentals of photography . The Olympus was purchased for my wife but I found myself using it quite a bit . It was much easier to use and the resulting photographs were better exposed and sharper than the Rollei Prego . One note to anyone that thinks that a long zoom is essential - keep in mind that at long zoom ranges the lense is at it 's slowest resulting more often than not in shots that are blurred because the camera cannot be held steady enough for the longer exposure . Consider a more moderate length zoom - 70 or maybe 80mm should be plenty without spending more for the opportunity of making unacceptable photos and consider the speed of the lense through the entire range of the zoom . One more thing - check out the reviews for the Olympus line of cameras and if you can live without a zoom , consider the Yashica T4 Super , too ! Goodluck .  
1	  This is a further review regarding a circular polarizer filter I purchased from Adorama . I wrote noting the shipping costs equaled the cost of the filter . Adorama then contacted me stating they would refund a portion of the outrageous shipping fees if i would change my rating of Adorama . I rated Adorama higher - then never received the credit I was promised . I will never shop with this company again .  
1	  The battery worked great for the first few months I had it . Last week I noticed when I put the battery into the charger , the charge indicator light was red , but after a few minutes , the charge light was green . However , when I put the battery into the camera , the camera indicated that the battery needed to be changed . It looks like a couple other people have had similar problems . There 's a 3 year warranty on this battery , so I emailed Lenmar to ask if I could get a replacement . Lenmar responded quickly , providing me with a return authorization number and detailed information on their warranty policy . However , since my battery was purchased more than 90 days ago , there 's a $ 7.50 shipping and handling charge for the new battery . Since I only paid $ 12 for the battery itself , I didn't think it was worth the trouble to get a replacement , especially since I could run into the same problem with the replacement . Anyway , I think it 'd be wise to spend the extra bucks for the Canon battery .  
1	  Can't say anything about the quality of the product - bought them as Christmas Gifts . I can say that I will never fall for a bundle pricing offer again - these were offered at a bundled price of $ 1.99 if purchased with the digital frames I bought - the shipping was separate and when added made them far more expensive than I could have purchased locally .  
2	  I just bought mine and it works great ! The software is easy to install . I had to download the software updates from adaptec . com to get rid of a couple bugs , but that was painless as well . I was able to get the full 8x writing ability to make an audio cd without any errors .  
2	  Received the fuse holders in just a couple days , very fast delivery ! Surprised at the quality of the in-line fuse holder . Better than I was expecting for the price . Tight cover should keep all moisture out and heavy enough wire to handle at least 30 amps .  
2	  Great for traveling . I throw this in my backpack and take it everywhere . I use this with my iPad along with a small , thin , Bluetooth keyboard . I love this product .  
1	  I was told by a videography producer in the industry that one of the first things I should buy when starting my videography business is a Pro Mist lens . He said that it helps to give a " film look " , kind of the same look as putting a nylon panty hose over the lens . So I went out and bought this 80 sum dollar lens just because of the advice I was given . BUT - Each time I used it , I did NOT like the picture . I do church filmings , weddings , events , interview segments .. and it looks horrible - not clear , it doesn't look professional at all . If you want the " film look " - I reccommend buying a camera that shoots in 24 frames instead of the 30 frames like most consumer cameras do . For my purposes , it was NOT worth the money .. I try to incorperate in my filmings .. but I end up taking it off because it never looks good . I did a filming of a bride getting ready - so I filmed some with it on / some with it off . With this lens on - made my footage look out-of-focus and like I didn't know how to film . I cringe when I see the footage of the pro mist filter . I 'm sure this lens would be good for abstract / creative photography , or those " glamour shots " but I don't reccommend it for filming .  
1	  I have already reviewed this once already , the party that sold me the product sold me a defective product . It did not work , so I complained and sent it back . I also received my money back . unhappy with the experience . the only good part is that amazon will post this bad experience online for others to see . J Tsang  
1	  The Manual for the GyroRemote & Keyboard Suite w / Receiver ( GP260-001 ) is what appears when clicking the Amazon Link included with this item 's description . The actual item for sale here at Amazon is : Wireless RF Keyboard w / Receiver ( GP220-001 ) which does NOT include the GyroRemote mouseand does NOT include the Ultra Professional Optical Mouse . Both of these mice are shown in the Digital Photo on Amazon . com . Amazon pictures two remotes with the keyboard and Amazon includes a link to the manual for the incorrect item ( GyroRemote & Keyboard Suite w / Receiver ( GP260-001 ) ) . By including a link to the incorrect item , Amazon confuses the consumer , and because of this error , Amazon mistakenly implies the GyroRemote is included with the Wireless RF Keyboard . The Description at Amazon states : 88-key Mobile Rf Keyboard with Receiver & 17 Hot Keys 100ft Range by GYRATION . The Gyration Web Site states for this item : 15 conveniently located Internet and multimedia hot keys , so I wonder why Amazon claims it has 17 Hot Keys . 17 and 15 are NOT the same number of hot keys . What you need is either : GyroRemote & Keyboard Suite w / Receiver ( GP260-001 ) ORUltra Professional Optical Suite ( GP270-001 ) . NOTE : Media Center Suite ( GP2100-001 ) includesGyroTools Media Center Control Software for Windows XP Media Center Edition so be sure you have the Media Center Edition ofXP operating system on your computer . I suggest Amazon clarify that the model on their web page does not include the mouse , and perhaps even show a photo of what you will be purchasing at Amazon , by asking gyration . com to allow them to include the digital photo of the Wireless RF Keyboard w / Receiver ( GP220-001 ) which is the actual item sold at Amazon .  
1	  It was only after I bought the TV mount I find out that I need to have an adapter as well . The adapter is over priced and way more material is included than is needed , but you 're stuck with buying if you want to be able to use the TV mount .  
2	  i was a little pissed off cuz it took more than the estimated arrival time for the item to arrive .. but it 's worth the wait . i have a 10 Mp Panny fz28 and this tiny card can store about 1000 pics . i am absolutely love it and i plan to buy another one .  
1	  Title says it all . These are very low quality cables and the female end is a joke . Look for ones that actually cover the male end you plug in and not this cheesy aluminum end like this one has . $U$ is the cable I went to and it rocked . Worked perfect for reasonable price . You 'll be glad you read this post . God Bless  
1	  I bought this camera after owning an Olympus digital camera for years . I was extremely happy with my Olympus , but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since I 'm expecting . This camera was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT . Just about every single picture I took had huge white blobs all over it . ( This only happened when using the flash . I must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash . ) Plus , if you used the zoom at all , the pictures came out fuzzy . The first digital camera I ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! The store I bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because I waited two days past the 14-day return policy . So , I sold the camera and took a $ 100 loss . I 'd much rather lose $ [ .. ] than keep this camera .  
2	  I bought this for my husband for Christmas along with an auto trash holder and it is being used every day .. it 's definitely worth the money !  
2	  Acoustically very good ear-bud , it beats most head phones hands down in sound fidelity and in blocking external noise . I also have quality ear-buds from Shure and Bose , but this one sounds better then both of them . It delivers deep bass as well as detailed treble and I can hear every instrument and vocal with absolute clarity . Ultimate Ear has become my favorite ear-bud . Like all ear-buds , I found it is uncomfortable after an hour usage , but it may be only me as in-ear comfort perception varies from person to person . Ultimate Ear comes with various sizes and types of silicone rubber flanges and plugs to best fit the ear canal . A very good tight fit is paramount for the best sound . A loose fitting ear-bud will lose all the bass response . So make sure you push the ear-bud all the way in and use the flanges or plugs which make the most comfortable but strong airtight seal . In my opinion , Ultimate Ear is undoubtedly one of the very best of its kind in its price point category . Only thing I dislike is its wire . The wires are thick which is good , but not quite flexible . So when I take it out from its box and try to uncoil it , the cables still tend to curl back to the coiled shape . I is very annoying to untangle and straighten the wire before every use .  
2	  I found this product easy to use . The instillation of the hard drive was well explained in the directions and if you need more information , there is plenty on the web site . It even looks good . Spend a little more for this enclosure . You will get all the cables you need for USB and Firewire .  
2	  My husband & I purchased the TomTom just before leaving on vacation . It was terrific ! It was fun watching the turns in the road - especially when we were in the mountains ! Not only did it save us time finding where we wanted to go , but it probably saved us from a lot of arguments as I am not a very good navigator ! We also enjoyed the feature that tells you where gas stations , restaurants , motels , etc . are .  
2	  I was having problems reading SDHC Cards on my SD readers , but no problem using my camera . So I scoured all the sites for a good deal on SDHC readers . I was dumbfounded about the inexpensive price that included the Extreme II cards . I have purchased two 2GB Extreme II cards that are great . I can take 3 shots / second with this card . Incredible stop action pics for tennis and football . The card reader is smaller than my old one I loved , what a plus . It takes the SDHC without a hitch . It comes with a groovy holder that protects the reader and card . This one is definitely a photographer 's friend . I wholeheartedly recommend this combo and I would like to thank everyone that has written reviews on Amazon because I come here first .  
1	  I bought the Safety 1st Safe Glow Monitor late last year . Now it switches off in the middle of the night without warning . I can't help but wonder how many times my daughter has woken up crying and I didn't hear her because I was depending on this thing ? I tried to call Safety 1st to ask them about and was asked to jump through hoops in order to get a replacement for this cheap monitor . You will be asked to fax your receipt along with your information . They verify it and then ask you to mail certain parts from the unit . Finally they will send you a check or voucher to replace it . NOT worth my time . I 've already told them that I am going to buy another monitor , but it will NOT be a Safety 1st product .  
2	  Plays all the file types you would want , good size and lightweight , built very solidly . All you need to do to play AVI or DivX is plug in your flash drive and the file list pops right up . My techno-phobic grandparents were able to manage it . Comes with AV cables , a pouch to mount it on a car headrest , car lighter adapter , ac adapter , and a set of very cheap and small headphones . Player plays well , picture is crisp , sound is clear . I only had 2 issues ; there was a small scratch on the right side of the screen , just large enough to be noticable , and just large enough that once you notice it , you can't stop looking at it . The other problem is the headphones ; as I said , cheap and small , so much so that they don't even come close to fitting a normal person , they seem designed for very small kids . If you 're going to buy this player , and I do recommend it , be aware that you 're probably going to have to invest in a decent pair of headphones as well . I paid $ 109 for the player and then spent $ 20 on a set of earbuds , which work perfectly , no background noise or scratching sound like with other players . I use it when working midnight shifts to kill time , if you 're a traveler and want to use it on planes or commuter rails , you 'll need to buy it a carrying case . Otherwise , it 's great .  
1	  Tomtom wants you to BUY most of the POIs that I expected to be included in the unit , walmart , bestbuy , many diners , resturants are not included in the box or available free from Tomtom  
1	  Apparently a replacement for the terrific 932c printer , this " upgraded " model is a bomb . Jams , can't print straight , picks up multiple sheets , and horrible service all add up to a misfire . I went through the hassle of getting two replacement units shipped to me , and both replacements had more problems than the original ! I 've written off my 940c . I don't think anyone should waste their time ( and certainly not their money ) on this one .  
1	  This is the first complaint on anything I have bought through Amazon . This product was fulfilled through 47th Street Photo . I specifically ordered it because it was advertised as Canon brand name products . When the order came , it was a Samsonite camera case ( nice , but bigger than the Canon item ) , and " off-brand " batteries and charger , similar to ones that I 've had trouble with in the past . It was specifically the Canon batteries I wanted , in addition to the case . I won't go through the return process , but I 'll think twice before ordering something again not sent directly by Amazon .  
1	  Samsung support is virtually useless , and this unit will still not play Dead Man 's Chest . Samsung says there will be a firmware update in a couple weeks . Up till now I 've always considered Samsung a very good company . This BD-P1200 fiasco has changed my mind . So BUYER BEWARE if you are considering a Samsung BD-P1200  
2	  This well priced , superbly performing product works well with Nikon digital cameras ( not all SD memory devices will ) . Highly recommended and the mini high speed reader is a welcome gift .  
2	  This product works just as it is supposed to , nothing snazzy just an awesome gadget !  
2	  These cartridges are fabulous . They may not look like the HP cartridge , but who needs a fancy label or a name brand on it . The cartridges fit the HP model , work wonderfully well , and save me a bundle . I will definitely be buying these again , and again , and again .  
1	  The volume wheel of my Rio Carbon broke few days after the warranty period ( 90 days ) and the Rio customer service does not care about it . I do not recommend this player especially due to the poor customer service . I bought my Rio Carbon for $ 249.99 four months ago . Its price dropped down to less than $ 179.99 ! . It is pretty easy to guess why ?  
2	  I bought this product a while back and it has yet to dissapoint . Great value for your money , by the far the best and most resistent external hardrive . Once you get it , you won't need anything else .  
2	  I bought it as a used one for less than 50 $ , the battery is so good that I can used it even if not with a car . The maps can be updated to the latest for free . A really good gps , I think I will use if for years . I love it  
2	  Live 20-25 miles north of the TV transmission towers , get a fabulous picture with this little antenna .. and I don't even have it on a mast above the rooftop . Local HD is fantastic . So far , happy with the purchase .  
1	  Under the technical details it says it , " Includes TI Connect Software CD .. " This is simply not true . All I received was the cable .  
1	  I live only a few miles from a repeater tower and this antenna couldn't pick up any local channel at all . The channels it did pick up were really low signal . The antenna that came with my other TV picks up all local channels just fine and in HD in perfect quality . Not sure why this antenna failed so badly , but just a fair warning to anyone out there thinking of it .  
1	  I had high hopes since I have used their DVD-R 's previously . The first disc had scratches and was damaged . It was also dirty with many particles present on the surface as well . The next few discs also were dirty . The product was returned to Amazon .  
1	  My hub stopped working after a few months ' use . I agree with 2 of the other reviewers - find a different company to do business with .  
1	  Received this TV in late November , but didn't have any HD sources until later on in December . The picture is amazing in HD , when it works . Unfortunately , most of the time the screen is covered in pink and green dots that clearly shouldn't be there . Sometimes , after about 20 - 30 minutes , these clear away and the picture is great . Samsung is supposed to fix it on 3 Jan , so we 'll see what happens after that . Update : TV was fixed under warranty today and looks great ! Samsung gave me no hassle in getting it fixed , so I 'll give this product 4 stars now .  
2	  I bought the Wolverine Data FlashPac 7-in-1 Memory Card Reader to take with me on a 3 week tour of Italy . The cost was more than offset by the cost of memory cards for my camera that I did not have to buy . It really was a one button operation and the batteries lasted the entire trip without recharging . There was a charger if I needed it . I used only 3 GB of memory and downloaded over 1000 photos . It is a nice compact , efficient machine .  
1	  Amazon site said by sony . and that is not what you get . Can buy other cheap bulb for a lot less . I wanted A sony bulb .  
1	  The online description states " Ideal for introductory university modules " , but the preface of the book ( which is not included in the pages that are provided for online viewing ) states " This book is not a basic signal processing textbook .. it is assumed you have a good knowledge of sampling , difference equations , z-transforms , FIR and IIR filters , FFT , etc . " I was looking for something more basic so I sent it back .  
1	  After doing a lot of research on the Net , I thought ; " ok the lighting is not good and the display is dark , but a lot of people really liked the camera " , plus Radio Shack has them on sale this week .. Well I should have taken these reviews more seriously . I bought the Fuji 2800 camera to replace my old trusted Kodak 240 digital camera . I wanted better zoom and a newer camera with the cool new features . What I got was a camera that did not take low light pictures very well at all and many of my pictures were out of focus . You might say , well I can live with the low light , I COULD NOT ! I need a camera that produces quality pictures regardless of light . And my pictures were fuzzy . NOT good Fuji ! Did you rush this one out the door or what . After calling Fuji 's Customer service they told me that I had a defective product and to return it . ( Being in denial I thought , maybe I was doing something wrong , because this camera had the zoom I really wanted . ) I did not really want to look at another Fuji after that dissappointing ordeal ..  
2	  This combo works pretty much as advertised to copy VHS tapes onto DVD 's of various formats . It isn't completely intuitive to operate , so , horror of horrors , you actually need to read the directions to operate it . The directions assume a level of competence I don't possess , so I 'm still trying to figure out how to split titles and edit , but that will come with some experiementing .  
1	  Don't think for a moment that you 're going to get high fidelity sound with these headphones . You 're better off buying a small mp3 player / fm tuner with wired headphones . Some of them even allow you to wear the device on your arm , getting you most of the freedom that these " wireless headphones " offer . I bought these as a Christmas present for my wife , and we 're both very unhappy with the sound . Also , the 900mhz frequency was of some concern , and it turns out to have been with good reason . We have a 900mhz cordless phone which uses " DSS " ( digital spread spectrum ; it does frequency hopping ) . It turns out that the headphones pick up a very frequent " click " noise which must be a result of the cordless phone 's transmitter going past the same certain frequency over and over again . But even ignoring that issue , the sound is just not what we 're used to from our mid-range consumer stereo and other experiences listening to consumer grade walkmen , cd players , and corded headphones on our hi-fi .  
1	  They DO NOT have ENERGIZER batteries . They sent me a substitute battery . I called and they said they did not have the energizer batteries . They did offer to credit me , I accepted . Now I have to get an energizer from some place else .  
1	  I purchased this unit Technics SA-DX 1050 stereo receiver - paid full price over $ 300 and because of the design of the mfg all circuits are on one fuse . WHen the unit gets hot - which it naturally does when in use or left on , it ruins the portion of the receiver that creates the stereo channels - ie . after only a few hours of use the stereo portion of this receiver is shot . When I took it in to get repaired - over $ 150 - I was informed of this particular issue of all the circuits being on one internal fuse . It stopped working only a few months after the repair .. My solution - buy another brand . Purchased at Best Buy - would NEVER purchase another Technics anything .  
2	  1st , The service was speedy and acurate no problems plus the prices are good . 2nd , The smartmedia card adapter worked but not for the Casio Keyboard which was what I needed it for . I agree with other reviewers that it 's because of the size of the XD card you use .  
2	  I love the sound that this system puts out .. Great bass quality .. good buy for the price ..  
2	  It is great product , like the remote control . It fits into home stereo and easy to switch back and forth .  
1	  I received my battery pack on time , but unfortunately I only used my battery pack for two weeks and then it suddenly failed . I don't know the reason ; I supposed the battery pack was compatible with the Sony PEG NZ 90 . Now the battery pack is death  
2	  I bought this filter to protect the fabulous Fujinon lens on my X100 . While I was sold on the idea of getting some basic cover for the front element and cutting visible haze , I was concerned that a cheaper filter would degrade optical performance with flare and non-parallel glass elements . I needed the promise of precision manufacturing , good glass and high performance coatings to feel confident about putting this on a favorite camera . This filter is heavy in the hand and appears really well built . It screws on and off the lens easily with no binding . Images taken before and after the filter show no degradation . Job done - wallet lighter !  
1	  We bought this GPS unit back in 2004 for cross country . It was great then . Then we did a software upgrade last year ( 2006 ) , and this year the unit is basically non-functional now . The unit freezes upon processing data / destination route . This is really disappointing for a company that sells the unit ( originally new for over $ 1K ) . We expected to get more life out of this unit . Additionally , we inquired about the unit repair-we would have to fork over another $ 200 to get the unit fixed after last year 's upgrade , which cost us about $ 200 then-to find out the warranty for the upgrade is only for 3 months . What kind of warranty is that ? What company would have so low confidence in their product to only offer a 3 month warranty ? $ 200 is no small amount . Recommend buying a GARMIN . Magellan people have a lot of problems to fix !  
1	  I purchased the WD57731 from The Big Screen Store in August 2006 . In November 2007 the light engine died . It took two weeks for the tech to come to the house to inform me that he couldn't fix it there . Two weeks later , I get a call informing me that the parts were backordered . The TV was not repaired until January 2008 . Now , in September 2008 , the TV won't even turn on . I 've tried the unplug overnight trick and the reset button trick . I called for service three days ago , talked to a machine , no return call . I called again today , Tuesday , talked to a machine . Four hours later , still waiting for a return call . I agree with the post suggesting a class action suit . Is there a lemon law for TVs ? By the way , I also called Mitsubishi customer service . I did speak to a person , but they were no help . They said to call them after the service is delivered . I guess my next stop is back to the Big Screen Store to discourage their customers .  
1	  this camera is an excellent camera . i bought it and it took great videos and good still pics . about a year after i got the camera i started getting an error message on the screen . it said that the unit was in safeguard mode eject and reinsert tape . upon doing so , nothing happened . the message still showed up on the screen . i tried everything i could think of to reset the camera . i removed the battery for several hours and tried again and the message still appeared . i have recently sent a message to jvc and am waiting for a reply on how to solve this problem . if you buy this camera make sure you get an extened warranty on it .  
1	  Before you buy this delicious looking combo read reviews . Problems with keyboard connection and making connection if you are succesful will take between 30 to 60 min ( ! ) of your time on regular basis . Tried to set up USB bus so it is not disconnected by Windows ( to save energy ) helped nothing in resolving the connection issue . Tried probably everything . Nothing works to fix connectivity issue . Unless you uninstall ane reinstall software every single day . Simply stay away . Don't even bother .  
1	  Product may seem good , but I 'm disappointed in not getting a TV included . Now upon looking at discription of product , it says TV audio . I 'm not sure what TV audio is , but I 'll use the product as some gift . If you could provide me with information on what is " TV audio " ? Thank You Don Snellenberger ..  
1	  When the USB cord is connected to the WD external hard drive , my computer will not sleep properly . The screen goes black and the internal hard drive spins down but the fan continues and the lights never begin to pulse as when the computer is in sleep mode . It won't wake from this state and the only thing that I can do is hold the power button until the computer shuts off . This only happens when the USB cord is connected , it doesn't matter if the WD hard drive is on or off . Firewire doesn't cause this problem and I use it for data transfer but I need the USB for the memory card reader . Also , The WD hard drive won't shut off unless I push and hold the power button . I eject the disk from my computer as intructed but the problem remains . When I push the power button on the WD drive the light flashes for a moment then remains on . I never transferred data to the drive so I don't think that it is transferring data when I try to shut it off . It sometimes won't show up on my desktop after waking from sleep mode . I have to go into utilities and unmount then re-mount the drive in order for it to show up . Besides all that it seems to work fine . The software is terrible so I just manually tranfer data to it . I have emailed Western Digital about this but haven't gotten a response from them . Machine Name : Power Mac G4Number Of CPUs : 2CPU Speed : 1.25 GHzMemory : 1 GBOS Version 10.4.9  
2	  I 've been using the Microsoft Natural keyboards for a number of years . I really think this is the best one yet . It is very comfortable and the keys have a great feel to them .  
2	  I bought 3 of these cables , even though I only needed two . I figured , at this price , I can buy 3 cables and still not spend as much as my local Radio Shack would want for one cable . All three cables functioned flawlessly on a 42 " Sony Bravia 1080p ( with sound bar / surround sound ) system . These cables work just as well as the ones that cost $ 30 and they 're a LOT easier on your wallet . If you have college kids in dorm rooms - send ' em a few of these in their next care package . They 'll resell them to their buddies and make some beer money for the week !  
1	  We bought this dvd player in May of 2004 , used it 4 or 5 times . The sound is very low in the car so you must buy the ear phones . We pulled it out recently for a trip and the left hinge just broke ! We were very careful with this item and yet it broke and is out of warranty . Save your money and don't buy Polaroid DVD players .  
2	  We live in the shadow of a hill . I installed a big Winegard HD7084P antenna on a chimney mount and we pulled in all the channels we needed , but a few were a little iffy and needed some twiddling of the antenna rotator . Our DTV converter box reported at most 52 channels with some channels hovering around 14 % on the antenna meter . During some weather conditions we were losing signal and missing the two or three shows we watch a week . I didn't want to go through the hassle of installing a preamp on the mast , so I bought the Motorola amp . The unit feels solid . I like the gold-plated connectors , especially the weather-sealed coax power connector . I hooked everything up , rescanned , and got 70 + channels . The borderline 14 % channel is now regularly reporting 54 % strength with no pixelation or dropouts . Everything else up to 70 % and 80 % . I 'm very pleased with this unit 's ease of installation , build quality , and performance . It 's one of the best A / V purchases I 've made .  
2	  Works great . Slight glitch when first hooking it up . My internet provider resolved the issue . Great price .  
1	  It is not worth it to buy these headphones instead of $ 15-$20 Sony , Nike or Koss headphones . I was looking for an upgrade over that basic level and I thought this would be it . I was wrong . Yes , the sound quality is better but the headphones have many downsides . First , I 've owned the headphones for 7 months and the wire covering is already frayed . Second , the length of the cord is insanely long and incredibly annoying . And finally , they only do an average job of staying put in the ear while running , especially that they claim to have the twist to fit system . Save money , buy something else .  
2	  Yes , they look strange . Yes , they look like a futuristic design from the 1980s-and indeed , they are from the 80s . However , for the price-range ( under $ 60 or so ) there is no comparison . Still none . These things have been on the market for ages , and folks still rightly rave about them . I remember using these babies on an old Sony Sports Walkman ( tape ) and the sound was amazing-big , fat bass , and loud . These are unmatched for bass , period , in portable headphone in this price range . They put the others to shame . Yes , they are bizarre-looking , and slightly awkward to fold up , and the metal clip in the middle might rip out a hair or two . But if you 're more concerned with the best sounding portable headphones for a Discman or an iPod rather than looking cool on the street with cooler-looking ( but inferior ) headphones , these things are perfect . Highly recommended . No accident that Koss ( an American company , no less ) hasn't changed up the design of these in ages-they don't have to . If you want something a little ' sportier ' and smaller , try the SportPro . Not as powerful , deep , or loud , but excellent in their own right .  
2	  I just wish I would of thought to buy it sooner works so much better than the plactic cover I had .  
1	  I got an iPod mini last in 04 for Christmas . It was so awesome then ! So pretty and good-working . Then about 2 months later i carried it around with me in my backpack in a special little makeup bag type thing and it didn't hold up very well even though i didn't move around a whole lot . Well i opened the bag up to listen to it on the bus and the entire screen looked awful ! There was a HUGE crack line down the front and the screen had an awful weird blackish line down it and a few tiny black lines too . I was shocked because i thought it would hold up better ! So luckily I got a replacement . But then about 4 months after i got the replacement , the battery life slowly dwindled down to about 1 and a half - 2 hours ! I was on a plane for vacation and it died halfway through the flight ! I brought my charger with me and charged it at the hotel , though . But i turned it on to listen to it , only to find that it only played 4 songs ! The 4 songs just happened to be the only ones on my iPod that i didn't buy and my friend later told me ( after i got home ) that i needed to plug it in the computer to fix that problem . But i didn't have my PC with me on vacation , obviously . And i don't have a laptop . So yes . I did that and it was all better ! But as soon as i plugged it in my other charger and took it off after it was fully charged , it did the same thing again ! So unfortunately i have to live with it that way and take off my purchased music , otherwise , it 's just wasted space . So I 've ended up with an iPod that : - Can only last for 2 hours - Skips over all my purchased music and plays only non-purchased music - Takes 4 hrs to charge but only plays 2 hrs ! So it 's pretty much obsolete in my mind . I am sort of weary to buy the Nano , seeing as how it has had lawsuits filed on account of it , because of the easily crackable screen and it 'd probably snap in my pocket . I am kinda leaning toward the video iPod even though it 's huge and i 'll never need 30 GB of music . But if i bought a battery pack for my iPod mini , it 'd cost me an extra 80 or 90 bucks and it 'd be double the size it is now , so why don't i just get a brand spanking new one ? I don't know . Apple is just sort of .. mm . So many problems ! and since Apple makes you pay like 100 bucks for insurance and warranties and stuff it 's like what 's the point ? I 'm basically banking on the fact that it 'll blow . Oh well . I don't know what to do . I have a useless iPod on my hands ! Whoopie !  
1	  Camera broke after having it for only a few months . The lens cover is stuck half open and half closed . When I turn it on or off it just vibrates and returns to that half & half position . I haven't even used it a dozen times . Called Sony to have it fixed and they said that it would cost over $ 100 just to look at it .. I will never buy another Sony again . Very disappointed .  
2	  My 5 year old loves it , she 's been using it for a couple of weeks and so far , no problems . Its really cute and easy to use .  
2	  You can't beat the price and they are very comfortable , especially if you were glasses . They 're bigger than I thought , but I 'm very happy with them .  
2	  This TOSlink to Miniplug is the perfect addition to my home theater . I use it to attach the Optical headphone jack on my Mac mini to my Yamaha 5.1 receiver . The mini connects to a HDTV LCD via DVI-HDMI cable and needs a separate audio connection . Sound quality is excellent with this cable ! And the price cannot be beat ..  
1	  I received an ipod for Christmas and still cannot get it to work with my Windows XP . I have spoken to the customer service support people over the phone 5 times and they cannot help me . When I went to my local Apple store at Stoneridge Mall in Pleasanton , California the " Geniuses " at the Genius Bar were far from being a Genius . Especially when they said , " We had a lady come in here the other day and we just couldn't get the thing to work on her Windows laptop . Oh well . " They refused to take give me my money back even though they admitted that my computer just might not be able to support the ipod . You call that customer service ? I have learned more on the Amazon reviews of ipods about how to get this thing to work than from the * # @ % ing Geniuses at Apple . THIS IPOD IS AN IFRAUD !  
1	  Good pack for a student but not a professional sales rep that travels a great deal . Not enough business card pockets or zipped pockets so lose items don't wander around the bottom . Also not enough pockets for cords , batteries , cables , etc .  
1	  I purchased this remote for use with some research software I run on a Windows XP machine . The software seemed to allow one to map individual keys on the remote to match the research software , but this never actually worked at all . I found the software to be cumbersome and not user friendly . I did test the remote with iTunes and it worked fine with that , but $ 60 for an iTunes remote ? I returned the remote and since have purchased a unit from Interlink ( more money , but actually works as advertised .. ) .  
1	  I went to a sporting goods store , bought a true water proof carry bag thats twice the size and was half the price . Now my Dig . Rebel , PLUS a second point and shoot dig . camera , 2 lenses , Canon 's 420 flash , multi filters , charger and cleaning products fit with room to spare . Don't rush out to purchase this bag , you 'll regret it .

1	  I have had this system and to earn 5 stars here is what needs to be fixed : 1 . The transmitter 's wire should not break in about 9 days thus creating nasty sound . The customer service rep . said that no replacement is available . The wire is special has 3 not to wires inside ! 2 . The sound has too much popping even with in 30 feet away from the transmitter , even more annoying at night . 3 . One of the speakers broke with in 1 year so much that you can barely listen to it unless at big volumes . Garbage !  
2	  I didn't use this very long , but not because of it . The Ipod + Nike kit just isn't very accurate . This pouch on the other hand is good . It fits well and attaches to your shoe laces . Make sure to follow the instructions ( yes there are instructions ) on which way to put the pod in . Otherwise it won't calculate correctly , or at least as correctly beause it 's usually pretty far off anyway .  
2	  - It 's big ( 8Gb , that 's more pictures you would have taken in a lifetime of film ) . - It 's fast ( you can make HD movies with it ) . - It 's cheap ( 32 bucks , how much is your camera ? ) - It works ( duh ) , = > So buy it , Dummy . I bought it too .  
1	  I purchased this printer just under 2 1/2 months ago . It did well and gavesharp copies . I went to use it today , and it will not power up . I usesurge protection on my computer and peripherals , and with no external powersupply , I am left with an oversized paperweight .  
2	  Where else can you get a mouse that 's a race car ? This is the best EVAR !  
2	  This is the second Harmony 550 Universal remote we purchased . The first one we purchased from Amazon was for our main TV system with HDTV , surround sound , DVD / CD player , Direct TV and DVR . The remote switches between the various options I programmed in , like Watch TV , Watch a DVD , Listen to radio , Play CD , Play Ipod , etc . and turns on and off the correct components and switches to the correct TV input when required . I found the Logitech programing fairly intuitive and easy to use . The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that on rare occassions , the remote does not select the correct input on the HDTV . However , if you just press the " HELP " button on the remote , it will prompt you asking " Did that fixed the problem " . If you answer " NO " , it will try again , and I have always found that this fixes the problem . We purchased a second 550 for our Bedroom TV which just has an HDTV with combination DVD / VCR player and it works the same way . You do have to use a different sign on for each remote with Logitech for programming a subequent remote , but that was not a problem . My wife , who is a self proclaimed techno-neophite , has no trouble operating either TV / remote when I am not home . I would definetly recommend this product if you are looking for a realitively inexpensive remote with lots of features and easy to use .  
1	  Simply put , these earbuds gives the worst , tinniest , least dynamic sound I 've ever heard in my life . It seems like Koss tried to actively develop lousy sounding earbuds because I can't imagine a beta tester using them and not saying they 're garbage . They are uncomfortable . The connection sucks . They are temperamental . Jiggling them causes the sound to sometimes drop out in one ear . The perfect trifecta : I bought them from Radio Shack , used them for a day , and promptly tossed them in the garbage . Do yourself a favor - look elsewhere .  
2	  We were very pleased with the speedy receipt of the product and the stated condition of the merchandise . Will purchase again from this vendor .  
1	  First , there is a small level of computer knowledge required to really use this thing at its full potential . Not much , just the ability to drag and drop files in windows . If you can do that , then you do not have to have your player tied down to any software , you can mix and match file types within album folders if you so choose , something that would melt itunes or windows media . The radio is excellent , the battery is decent , the screen is nice , the sound is very good . It looks nice , survives falls easily . The ability to read text files and record voice is good for students . Plus if you carry this around , and you dont really need a thumb drive . so why only two stars ? Cause the longest I have ever heard one of these things lasting was just under two years . Generally the firmware fails somehow and you can no longer transfer files . The mini jack is not of the highest quality ( when obviously the mini jack should be the most durable thing about any portable music player . ) If you do get one for like 50 $ or something be sure to carry around a small paper clip btw , you will need to reset it semi regularly .  
2	  I bought this lens to take macro photos of insects , and stuck it on my Nikon D80 years ago . It has never let me down . Mine has great glass-I 've never looked at a shot and thought : Oh no , I should have used a better lens . Plus , since it cost very little ( compared to others .. ) , I will NEVER give it up-even though I 've since bought fancier lenses by far because I never have to worry about Ooops ! bashing it or dropping it when crawling around in the woods or through a marsh . I know I can replace it . And I would !  
2	  So since my cars a piece of work from 2000 , this is exactly the sort of thing that I needed . It works just like a charm , and the second you open the box you 're pretty much set to use it . The wire is adjustable to fit any cassette drive , and it 's indefinitely long enough to reach any sorta place you 'd want to cram your player . However , when listening to music always make sure that your player 's volume is at 100 % and your car 's audio system at the lowest point , otherwise you 'll get a very grainy sound that might shatter your ears . You can adjust it as needed , but for the price I got this at you definitely get more than what you 're paying for ; as most cassette adapters will cost well over 25 to 30 bucks . I 've heard rumors that these things break down , but for the 2 months I 've had mine , I can't say I 've had any real problems with it . The chord might be a tad bit thin , but if you use common sense and treat it properly , it shouldn't snap on you any time soon . In other words , this product is cheap AND useful ; two things that don't usually coincide . If you 're looking for a cassette adapter , I 'd say this would be your best bet .  
1	  Keyboard is great . Help with adapting this to a Mac they want to charge for which I don't think is right . So I fumbled , found a download and all is well .  
1	  On my iMac ( intel 2.16ghz with 2G ram and Leopard OSX ) this product behaved erratically frequently crashing after a few cards were scanned in . The OCR was only about 60 % accurate and I had to manually enter most of the data . Even after talking to tech support and updating the software to the latest Leopard compatible version the crashes still occurred and the accuracy remained unchanged . I can't in good faith recommend this product to any Mac owner ..  
2	  this watch is one of the coolest watches i have ever seen . i have read reviews and technical data about similer products like the casio pathfinder . the pathfinder primaraly has the same fetures as the vector . the difference is that the pathfinders altimeter can be off by 1400 ' or more in stable weather ! the vectors altimeter never really gets off more then 200 feet . if you want one of the best watches avalable get the suunto vector  
2	  CONS : 1 . Let 's get this out of the way . It 's heavy . Your head won't be used to it but after you wear this for a few days and get past a little neck pain , your muscles will strengthen and then you get all the benefits . PROS1 . Unlike a lot of headphones , these are really hard to break . 2 . Unless you have special studio phones , these are absolutely without a doubt the best headphones ever . The quality is superb and you won't find something better for this price . 3 . These headphones tune out the whole world . Get ready for hours of enjoyment . It 's like being at a concert or listening to a fine symphony or opera . 4 . It 's Koss so it has a lifetime warranty with no questions asked . I have a lesser pair that have been destroyed twice ( one time I jerked the cord standing up and it stopped working and the other time a vacuum cleaner tore the two side cords off ) and Koss had a new pair sent to me and I didn't lie about how either were damaged . 5 . All I have to say : Koss all the way . Stay with this company faithfully and the dividends will be enormous .  
1	  Headphones advertised as " noise canceling " . I could hear more sound happening outside of the headphones than I could from the inside . Ended up returning them . Not worth purchasing if you 're looking for something that will block out exterior sound .  
2	  I haven't had any difficulty obtaining a seal with the Sennheiser PX 200W , and it provides sufficient isolation to be usable on the subway . This headphone has a nice midrange , producing vocals that sound quite natural , but the treble is severely rolled off above 10 KHz and there 's a pronounced midbass hump , resulting in a overall sound that , while pleasant enough for casual , portable listening , isn't at all refined or " high end " in character .  
1	  For one , this product is built very cheap . This means that overtime some ports will simply stop working .. why ? I 'm not really sure .. perhaps cheap components , and slight bending ? Secondly , it does not support charging , and yet it does at the same time . If you plug in say an apple device you 'll get an error , but it will charge which again does not make sense . This is not a 3.0 USB hub , it 's a 2.0 . Many new devices will require you to have 3.0 now or in the near future . For instance , my new webcam hates being plugged into this hub as the performance greatly drops . Lastly : Mine is just about destroyed , because of a slight drink mishap . Nothing seems to be wrong with device other than .. it stops working from time to time , and I sometimes have to clean the ports with a small amount of water to get it to work again .. just very annoying . - Additional Notes : The Stand is horrible . It won't stay on , especially if you have multiple cords attached that pull in various directions like the power cable . ( It falls out easily , it does not snap on , it 's basically just a slightly heavy stand that it " rests " on top of . ( Useless ) - It glows neon Blue . Why ? I 'm not sure . I like it because it matches my setup , but it 's very bright , and I 'd rather the " power " be used towards the other devices . Finally : This device will likely not support 7 devices being plugged in at the same time .. I would get 3-4 to work .. maybe .. at any given point . Eventually the two bottom ports simply decided to " not work " entirely which is completely stupid because I rarely ever used those ports to begin with . This also made me think there was something wrong with my device , and wasted my time trouble shooting . ( just had to switch ports ) In other words .. don't buy this device .. get a cheaper hub with more slots , or a 3.0 hub with more features . This is cheap ..  
1	  This is not a Canon product - despite what the photo looks like or how the product is described . It 's a compatible ink cartridge .  
1	  I got this as a cheapo lens protector - with some UV filtering as a supposed bonus . I liked it - until I just got back from a trip shooting wildlife on my Canon 70-300mm f / 4-5.6 . All the images with that lens were slightly blurred . Those I focused manually , those that auto-focused , wide-open or stopped-down . Slow or fast shutter , even on a tripod . All detail was blurred . I got home to shoot some test photos , and I found that when I took this filter off , images were perfectly sharp . Look at the fencepost comparison photo I included in the images . All settings are the same between the two shots , just the one on the right is with the Tiffen 58mm UV filter , and the one on the left is without . FYI - I also have a BW 77mm F-Pro MRC UV filter that I tried on that same lens with an adapter , and the images were crystal clear . Tiffen is going in the trash and I 'm buying a different brand .  
2	  I 've been using this printer for about 3 months , light duty , and am very pleased with it . The quality of black text is very good indeed , and color printing is quite nice . The limited number of photos I 've printed look great . And it 's fast ! After living for years with the HP 560C 's tri-color cartridge , I love the separate ink tanks . I always thought it was really lousy to have to throw out a tank that had ink left in two of the chambers , but was empty in the third . Canon hgas me sold ! One thing - take your time aligning the print heads , and really try to do a precise job . It makes all the difference in the world with your print quality .  
1	  I tried four copies ; three were bad , one was awful . This lens has been very favorably reviewed , and I find their 50 f1.4 to be magnificent , so I took a chance . The only thing I can think , based on what I saw in the files , is that in each case , one or more of the elements was out of alignment , because they didn't produce a normally focused image at any focus distance . Something 10 feet away on one side would be in focus , and something fifty feet away on the other side would be . Very strange .  
1	  I bought this bag looking at the display on amazon . But compare to price I paid this bag is not atall good . Size is small , extra pockets are useless , where you cant keep much . Camera pocket is also not convenient . Only plus point is quality of material used .  
2	  THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT . IT 'S A LITTLE HEAVY . VERY SOLID . VERY BRIGHT ON ITS HIGHEST SETTING . THE BRIGHTNESS IS ADJUSTABLE WITH A KNOB THAT GOES FROM % 100 - % 10 . THE LIGHT GETS A LITTLE YELLOW ON THE LOWEST SETTING . I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT .  
1	  You get what you pay for . I tried these and was very disappointed at the quality . All were warped and touched the DVD surface and the clear outer cover was poorly attached to the case . Not a case I would put any of my DVDs into .  
2	  This product deserves a boost in Amazon ratings , so I simply want to tell a prospective buyer that this machine prints superb photos and crisp , clear documents . If you follow the installation instructions , everything works fine . I have XP Home and had no problem whatsoever with the installation . It looks really slick also and you can add an additional paper tray and 2 sided printing unit . This machine is well worth the money .  
2	  I wanted an XM radio for working ( daily ) in my garage , and for interstate ( somewhat infrequent ) car travel . This car unit saves me money by allowing me to own only one radio , and transferring that radio into the car on an as needed basis . Absolutely not as convenient as having a built-in , or professionally installed unit , but it serves its purpose for those that have a Pioneer Inno , and own an older vehicle that still has a cassette player ( required ) . The magnetic antenna has stayed on the roof securely , and I 've had no problem in getting the unit to function properly . You can stick the unit to your dash with adhesive , or hang it from one of the air vents . I chose the later . Depending on the vent in your car , it may not hang perfectly . Mine tilts downward from the weight of the unit . Overall , I can recommend the car kit , but keep in mind that it requires a cassette player in your vehicle . If you plan on buying a new car in the near future , you may find yourself trying to sell this used , in what I don't think is a huge market .  
1	  Player installed just fine but will not work with a firewall on the server computer . Called tech support and they told me they are telling their customers to disable their firewalls . I find that absolutely amazing in this day and age . The interface for playing music will show you albums without the artists names , artists without the album names or playlists that display song titles without artist or album information . With a ripped CD collection of over 500 titles and without the ability to identify what I 'm listening to I find this to be only of use for background listening . I 'm a tech junkie so I 'll hang on to this for the time being , but I 'm certain this device will soon be overshadowed by something more capable and intuitive that provides for network security as well .  
2	  I can't use earbud headphones so the Sony headphones work perfectly . The sound quality is excellent ! Won't fall off when you work out !  
2	  I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas to use in college as her last one was stolen out of her backpack ! She loves it . Superb quality . Excellent price .  
2	  THIS CAMERA IS GREAT , TAKES A LITTLE BIT TO FIGURE OUT ALL THE SETTINGS , GREAT PICTURES  
1	  I purchased this TV for $ 2400 + tax in November 2005 . In April 2007 it ceased to function . Fortunately I had the Best Buy ( should be called Worst Buy ) 4 year performance service plan ( for which I paid an additional $ 400 ) . It took a few days for the independent contractor that services the warranty to pick up the set , then it took 2 weeks for me to get it back . When I got it back it turned on just fine the first time . The second time I tried to turn it on it no longer worked . It 's back in the contractor 's shop now for who knows how long . Best Buy won't replace the TV until the FOURTH time it fails to work .. I will update this review ..  
1	  I really was looking forward to reading this book , however , by page 250 or so , I just wanted it to get to the point so I could put it behind me . The author 's style of writing is intricate and delicate , making for long and eloquent sentences that wound their way into to paragraphs full of promise and drama . The disappointment , however , is how the author failed to make any of these paragraphs tie into anything even resembling a plot . What is sold to the reader on the back of the book as a mystery , is in actuality a muddle of characters , plots and subplots that have absolutely nothing to do with one another and failed to fully mature . I wasted so much time on plodding through this morass , that by the time I finally reached the wretched , anti-climatic end , I immediately threw the book away in frustration and disappointment . I didn't even feel it was worth of inclusion into my personal library . What a shame .  
2	  Excellent digital camera , superb optical zoom and image stabilization system . Easy operation , has a very clear ( and large ) LCD screen .  
1	  It looks nice . But that 's the only good thing about this flawed MP3-CD player . Long startup time , small display , problems reading certain CDRs , problems playing certain MP3 files , bad skipping . Biggest issue ? It 's not flash upgradable , which means you 're stuck with these problems and they can never be fixed . I returned the EXP103 and now own the excellent Riovolt from Sonicblue . A superior MP3-CD player in every way .  
1	  The unit itself is ok , other than the battery was completely dead on arrival . The real problem is I ordered a new unit , on sale directly from Amazon and I was sent a refurbished unit , with the previous users home address and destination addresses still in the memory of the GPS . I finally found the phone number for Amazon , which isn't easy . They should have sent me a new unit and picked up my refurbished unit . Instead , I have to send back the unit I received , for a refund . The new units are no longer on sale , so I would have to buy a refurbished unit or pay a lot more . I said ok , then just credit me the difference of what I paid for a new one , to the price you sell a refurbished one for . Amazon said , " no " . Part of my purchase price was a gift card , so , I am afraid things will get even more screwed up if I return it . I am very disappointed with Amazon .  
1	  The mechanics of this mouse was ok , the exterior sides , however became sticky almost like it had a gooey melting rubbery material flaw .  
2	  This remote is great . Setting it up on the computer is much easier than making it learn via IR signals , and it has worked great . There are only two problems : 1 . My roommates don't quite seem to understand how to use it , and they keep going to the " Devices " menu and choosing the individual components of the system to control - effectively picking up another remote . 2 . It seems to set the wrong input on the TV when switching between activities . This could be my fault , and I 'm going to try to fix it by reprogramming it . For reference , the TV is a Samsung and only allows you to cycle through the inputs .  
1	  While visually appealing and an absolute GREAT fit in the ear for joggers / athletes , the plastic casing around the wire splintered in multiple places within a mere day of use-rendering them essentially useless . I was incredibly disappointed .  
1	  Pros : Does this do anything other cards don't ? Cons : Uh , where to start . First of all this thing AIN'T WORKING . It hasn't been working for over a month and no amount of reinstalling of drivers etc will work . I 'm an IT professional and I 'm comfortable with networks , but this product is flawed . Secondly , when it was working the PERFORMANCE IS POOR . My machine was the nearest to the router in the office - less than 2 metres - and I regularly got link quality dropping below 50 % ! . Also there were occasional hangs . The other machines got worse . This is particularly annoying when you consider what figures Linksys claim for this POS . In short , HORRIBLE software , HORRIBLE documentation , HORRIBLE support , POOR performance . Get the Netgear MA401 instead because Linksys don't deserve money for this flawed product .  
2	  These are cans that sound good , not great . I bought these for the mobility and in that they are pretty good . I do have some static occasionally , but if I simply switch channels it usually goes away . My set does have the EXTREMELY obnoxious low volume issue where they shut off after 3-5 minutes if low sound is coming through them , so don't think you are going to use these to list to some quiet , smooth jazz or anything . Again , they are good not great , but are the best wireless cans I 've tried overall .  
2	  This is the first set of noise canceling headphones that i have owned . I spent a long time researching which headphones would be the best between 50 and 75 dollars . Sony had a nice set but there were a lot of complaints about a loud humming sound when the noise canceling was turned on , pretty much all the different headphones i looked at had similar reviews . I have had these headphones for a couple days now and there is a very very faint humming noise when music is not being played through the headphones , other than that they have a very nice sound and are pretty comfortable . For only paying 75 $ for these headphones i think they are definitely worth it . I will be traveling in India soon so I guess that will really test how good they are , but i am confident they will perform great .  
1	  I received my m505 as a birthday gift , replacing my broken but beloved Palm IIx , so I hate to criticize something that was free . However , I am mad that a loved one paid more than $ .. for this gift . I realized what a disappointment the device was before I even did my first HotSync . The cheap stylus , which is hard to remove from the handheld and has no weight for writing , was the first tip-off . It seems like a small thing , but the stylus is the primary tool for using the handheld , so it really makes a difference . I hurt my fingers trying to get it out of the side slot and it hasn't gotten any easier to remove with time . Also , my old styluses , which are much nicer , don't fit into the side slot so I can't use them unless I carry them around somewhere else . And what use will I ever have for an expansion slot ? The cards seem like a useless gimmick to me , with the possible exception of using a card to back up files when away from your desktop . For me , that 's hardly ever . I also don't need more space . Even as a busy journalist with lots of notes and records , I haven't used half of what is available . Moreover : Don't need more games . Very few U.S. cities are available on the travel card . In a way , I wish Palm or some other company would give us something worthwhile in the way of card programs . But isn't the idea of carrying a Palm to streamline and get away from carrying extra things , like expansion cards ? Unlike some other reviewers , I am fairly pleased with the monitor , which is a major improvement from my prior Palm . I also like the quickness of the computer . I like the notepad program , too , but I noticed it doesn't work with as much accuracy as it could . However , none of these positives outweighs the negatives and the high prices of these new Palms . I 'm sure a lot of people will soon agree and make plans to jump to a better product .  
1	  Cartrige I received expired in 2006 and had leaked all over the place . The description said that it was a new cartridge . Now i know why it only cost 1.94 . The shipping was around 4.95 . I just threw it away , did bother returning it .  
2	  I bought this bag to lug around all the notebooks , books , & supplies I need for Nursing school . So far this bag has held up really well . Not to mention being rolled , kicked , & slung around the parking lot & class rooms . It should survive me the 2 years of the program & beyond !  
1	  We were so disappointed witht the iball . Do not reccomend it . Did not work out of the box .  
1	  Never could get this adapter to work ! Have used other brands of adapters with no problems , but this one just flat wouldn't work .  
2	  The product is one of those technologies that you should expect to see in almost every home , perfect for anyone who cannot decide what pictures to put in a room . I personally take my pictures then upload them to the frame , and just let it " slide show " .  
2	  I bought Jensen 2749 as an after-Thanksgiving special for $ 199 . The lowest price for all 27 " flat screen TVs . My biggest discovery is not the super low price and very good picture quality but that it has PAL playback function . I have some PAL DVDs and when viewed with my old GE TV , the pictures were black / white . ( My pioneer DVD player does not have a PAL-NSTC converter ) Now they are with beautiful colors ! What a super buy ! The TV broke in less than 5 months ! When I was watching Boston Marathon , I heard a spark noise from inside the TV and then the picture became foggy with insufficient contrast . Difficult to find service and I would have to pay the labor cost . After some efforts I returned it to the seller and bought a Sony 27 flat . When watching DVDs , the Sony is slightly better but it does not support PAL . When watching TV program ( without cable ) , the Sony is not as good as Jensen . I hope it will last much longer than my Jensen .  
1	  I like this player , the sound is good , it 's light , it 's compact . There 's just that one niggling , hardly-worth-mentioning , thing - it 's just not " jogproof " . Go running with it and it 'll skip or , even more likely , stop playing all together . A shame really .  
1	  I wish I had checked here before purchasing . The DVD player failed right out of the box . The same load / read issue as everyone else . It 's going back tomorrow ! I guess I 'm lucky that it failed right away - I 'd hate to be stuck with the darn thing .  
2	  Great company to deal with - I ordered wrong items - this company responded immediatly and my transaction was a breeze  
2	  If you buy these with the expectation that a pair of $ 30.00 speakers will rival much larger and more expensive speakers - you 'll be disappointed . If , like me , you have a space limitation , you will be more than pleased with the sound that comes out of two 4-inch speakers ! I 'm very satisfied with the speakers and find the sound remarkably full for the size .  
1	  I cannot get this cover to fit the new iPod Nano . Maybe it fits the old one ..  
1	  It 's quite annoying when a product has to be thrown away after 2-3 years because the cost of a minor repair is greater than the cost of a new one . Our HP Office Jet 5510 no longer feeds paper and the Geek Squad says replacing the barrings costs more than a replacement . Do we need to be a throw-away society ? I 'll do more research before buying next time .  
2	  " You get what you paid for " is a common saying these days , especially with electronics , and when it 's about TVs , it speaks the truth . I 've had two prior HDTVs before settling down with this Sony BRAVIA KDL-32S3000 , a Vizio and a Sharp . Granted they provide a nice HD picture , it just seemed they could be better . I bought this Sony from all the reviews I 've read , and from the fact that I constantly look at it when I go to a major electronics store , comparing it between other companies and other Sony TVs as well . Once I got it home , properly calibrated it , the picture quality was stunning to say the least . The colors really do pop on this TV set , more so than the other TVs that I have own . Contrast ratio really does make a difference when it comes to LCD TVs , and I 'm not talking about that Dynamic contrast ratio with crazy numbers like 7000:1 to 15,000:1 , I 'm talking about the " true " on-screen contrast ratio . This 32S3000 Sony provides up to 1600:1 on-screen contrast ratio , which for an LCD is very good . The other two TVs I owned had 1000:1 and 1200:1 , and yes I can notice the difference . Typical of any big name company , Sony in this case , TV build quality is top notch . Built like a tank , this TV speaks quality . I like especially the matte black look bordering the TV , as I 'm not a fan on the piano black trim some TVs have . No worries of backlight bleeding or hot spots on the LCD screen , everything is uniformity , much improvement over Sony 's last generation of BRAVIA sets . 2 HDMI inputs , 2 Component inputs .. all which that can accept a 1080p signal . Now this is not a 1080p TV , but it can accept the signal and down converts it to 720p , or the 1366x768 native resolution . This is cool , as I can send a 1080p signal from Playstation 3 and it will accept it with no problem . HD content is quite amazing , from cable to Blu-ray movies , they all look good on this Sony set . You will be amazed . Simply put , if your even thinking of getting this TV , do it ! You will not be disappointed .  
2	  This was one of my best purchases for the 360 to date . You will save SO much $ on batteries by using the play and charge kit ..  
2	  Pros : I found this to be a nice accessory with 3 items in a single writing tool . It has a comfortable grip and the tip on the pen is fine which works well for my purposes . Cons : The ink on the plastic near the screw on area to replace pens wears off easily ( I had it a month and it was all worn ) . The plastic is not so nice as the metal pens I got for the same purpose ; but for 9.99 ; Actually I also got a Pilot Dr. Grip with a Pen and Stylus and like it alot better . The switching from pen to stylus to pencil is not that good and sometimes hard to do without having to completely unscrew the barrel !  
2	  By far these headphones are the best pair for under $ 100 . I went through a pair of Sony 's and the Sennheiser P-200 before getting these and they sound as good as everyone says . My only beef with these is the cheesy hook system for collapsing them . It works , yes , but the hook and it 's mate on the other side hit the tops of my ears and annoy me ! I 'm really tempted to take some metal snips and cut them off , but than I 'd had sharp metal potentially and that could be worse . Even with that little problem , I give 5 + for these and will probably buy a second pair .  
1	  I tried the trick of resizing , but honestly , the image quality is still abyssmal . The images are so low-resolution that only the vaguest of detail comes out . Please , if you 're thinking of buying this for someone for Christmas this year , choose something else . It might be okay for someone with low standards or poor eyesight , but for anyone who can see well and knows what a good digital image looks like , this will be a huge disappointment . The good news is that in a few years these digital keychains will have advanced and will offer much better performance - that 's almost guaranteed . So put this one on the " must buy for mom " list for the 2008 Christmas season . I very seldom write a review , and only wrote this one to keep people from making the same mistake I did .  
1	  Based upon the mostly positive reviews , bought these . Not very good . The silicone ( or whatever ) earbuds are very comfortable , but that 's about all there is that 's positive to say . Very tinny and anemic . No range at all . Ultimately , they sound lousy . I bought these as a replacement for the phones that cames with my Iriver HP-120 Mp3 Jukebox , but these earphones are very clearly inferior .  
2	  This is my second pair of these DJ headphones . My first lasted 7 years and I 'm looking forward to the next 7 . I can't say enough good things about them , so I 'll stick with " they rock ! " .  
1	  These speaker if you could call them speakers BLOW and I dont mean that in a positive way ! They are cheaply made but cost a fortune the sound SUCKS and the woopdidoo lights burn out ! SAVE YOUR MONEY and run from this product .. Don  
2	  I have a HP Compaq TC4400 . This is the pen for it . Compared to the one I got with the tablet PC this one is designed to be harder to break , which is a good thing . My previous one broke when I accidentally dropped it on hard ground .  
1	  My 2 stars are for the aesthetics and versatility of this product , respectively . They definitiely appeal to a broad range of people , and its a great idea to include three different sizes for all ear canals . BUT .. These are badly designed . Any earbud with such a narrow speaker is an open invitation for permanent hearing loss . I tried the small and medium sizes first and while the medium fit very snuggly , it felt WAY too deep . With the large , i couldn't get a good seal and subsequently wound up with poor bass quality . We were told for years to take caution when cleaning our ears with q-tips - all of a sudden , we throw that advise out the window in the name of convenience . Over the head or around the neck headphones are certainly cumbersome , but at least you know what you 're getting . Too many earbuds are manufactured without accounting for people 's poor judgement . Push em too far in to get a better seal and you wind up listening to dead silence for the next 50 years . These are also supposed to provide great bass and I was not impressed . When it comes to headphones , solid bass comes from a solid seal . Earmuff headphones are the best in the biz there . Any earbud trying to accomplish the same type of bass is going to warrant shoving them as far as possible into your ear . FYI , Sony offers more affordable earbuds with better audio quality and a safer design . Sony MDR-E828LP Fontopia Earbuds with Winding CaseI 've had em for a year and they 've never failed .  
1	  While I purchased my DVD201 almost 2 1/2 years ago , I have yet to put over 30 hours of recording on it . The problem is that the camera has a horrible time with disc access errors . I have used brand new SONY DVD-R discs ( both the 1.4GB single sided and the 2.8 GB double sided ) , and every time it is a crap shoot as to whether it will work or not . About 1/3 of the disks never get recognized by the camera at all - and basically have to be returned as bad , even though they seem to work ok in my personal computer . Of the ones that originally work , almost HALF of them end up with disc access errors at some point - many when I am finalizing the disc ! That means I lose the entire contants of the recording ! I 've lost recordings of family vacations , holidays and birthdays , and finally ( the straw that broke the proverbial camel 's back ) I LOST THE VIDEO OF MY ONLY DAUGHTER 'S WEDDING ! UNBELIEVABLE ! I went to SONY 's online " help " , and found it was a joke ! Not only were they incredibly slow , they asked me the same questions over and over again . DId you format the diswc ? ( no - the DVD-R 's do not require formatting ) . Have you finalized the disc ? ( no - the camera does not even recognize it has a disc in it - I can't even record , let alone finalize anything ) Have you tried a new disc ? ( yes , about 6 of them , right out of the package ) If the discs would fail initially , then I could at least get new ones - BUT TO HAVE IT FAIL AFTER THE PICTURES ARE RECORDED does not leave me ANY options . SONY recommended going to a data recovery house to recover the data , but they want $ 400 bucks to get whatever you get - I am not even sure the data is recoverable ! I 've been on several boards and have seen the same problem reported over and over ( unfortunately , not before I had purchased the camera ) . Has ANYONE had ANY luck getting this camera to work reliably ? SONY wants $ 211 ( flat rate ) for me to send the camera to them for repair , and a couple of other places have quoted about $ 140-$160 . Before I throw any more money down the drain with this camera - I 'd like some assurance that it will actually work . ANY suggestions greatly appreciated !  
2	  All I can say is that I simply love this amp . It is worth every penny if you are looking for A LOT of BOOM for your buck . But be warned this is a very high out put amp and will easily blow any competition subs if they are not a true high RMS watt sub . I am running Solar Baric L5 's with the amp running just over half and it is simply heart pounding , ear bleeding , a punch in the chest total onslaught of bass rattling the pictures off my neighbors walls the next block down . If I knew this amp was gonna produce the amazing power it does I would have gone with Higher wattage subs or sub . I still am debating on throwing a Memphis 18 " in the trunk and turning this amp all the way and watch my trunk lid fly off its hinges . Highly recommended if you are looking for an extreme amount of power . This amp at 1.3 ohms pushes around 2400watts rms and peaks over 3300watts . If you want you subs to last make sure they are rated very high RMS wattage not peak wattage . example If you subs say 2000w peak but only 500w RMS you will melt the voice coils right out of them at 1ohm .  
1	  Oh , my hopes were high for a VGA / USB switch between an old Mac and a new MacBook Pro . But alas , these hopes were dashed when it became clear that the Zonet relies on a " scroll lock " key - which simply doesn't exist on most Mac keyboards - for USB switching . All calls to Zonet tech support proved fruitless , though I did get someone on the phone within a couple minutes .  
1	  I want to love these headphones . They are comfortable , they sound great , they noise isolate as well as any other set I own , and no wires ! Other reviews say the range isn't great , but that isn't important to me - I generally have my iPod in backpack , bag , or pocket and just don't want wires dangling around me . I was all set to give these a 5 , but then I had a synchronization problem . I had my iPod in my hands , my headphones in my ears , and for whatever reason , I just couldn't hear the music - in fact , the little green light wouldn't come on on the transmitter - but the operation is just plug and play - couldn't have been a user error on my part . I sat on a plane between Portland , Oregon and Washington , D.C. , cursing my headphones the whole way . Now the operation appears to be intermittent . I have no idea under what condition they will decide to work and when they won't , so I end up carrying a spare pair of earbuds with me .  
2	  In the past I 've purchased replacement batteries for my Uniden phone from Radio Shack . This year I noticed my phone wasn't holding a charge more than an hour so I knew it was time for a new battery , before the phone couldn't hold a charge at all . I walked over to Radio Shack ( with my phone handset and its battery ) to purchase a replacement . Because the battery in my phone didn't list any technical specs , I wasn't sure which battery I needed because the new battery packages didn't have enough information for me to be sure I had the right battery and the store clerk didn't know either . Also , I noticed the price for batteries had nearly doubled . Between the price and the store clerk , I decided to go back home and check on Amazon for a replacement . I was surprised that I could get the same battery on Amazon for well under the price at Radio Shack . The technical specs were detailed enough that I felt confident I 'd ordered the right battery . Even paying for shipping , the total price was several dollars less than Radio Shack . The item shipped quickly and , although I don't have any electronic testing equipment to verify this , it seems to work as well as any previous battery . In comparison to my experience at Radio Shack ( which I won't include here because it was not the usual , satisfied experience I 've always had in the past ) , the Amazon purchase was a breeze . I expect I 'll buy another back up battery in the next few months so I have it on hand next year ( these batteries only last a year or two ) but I 'll definitely check out Amazon first before I buy any electronics in the future ..  
2	  I saved over $ 50 purchasing the itrip here on amazon . com . It works wonderfully ! It is easy to change stations and great in the city where so many stations are already taken . The fact that it is a charger is an extra plus . I would highly recommend to others .  
2	  i just bought one to day and it shakes my room my parents LIKE THAT and it is not 300W it is 360Watts and i have a boies and i got this and i gave my dad the boies well i like it thank you .  
2	  There are two of these Kill-a-watt usage monitors ; one with the ability to project expected usage and this one , which actually takes an average over time of the usage . Because of this , this one is more accurate . The man of the house is fairly meticulous and wanted the EXACT usage , so we got this one . He is absolutely ecstatic about this thing . I think it 's pretty cool myself , as it 's given us a valid , non-superficial reason to replace our hideous but still running fridge .  
2	  i really like this item because it can hold so much the only downside to this is that it didnt come with a usb cable or the little pouch .. my only negative to this : if youre gonna sell stuff , put pictures of the item you 're planning to sell not put pictures of the item you 're selling along with things that don't come with it :)  
1	  I have had Epson printers for over 10 years so I know a good Epson printer when I see one . This is not a good printer . The colours are dull despite being heavy on ink and the printer needs constant head cleaning to keep away heavy banding . While not being a professional standard at this price you would expect this to be a quality product . Mine failed after 15 months and , in my opinion , Tech Support are neither Technical or Supportive . I would strongly advise caution before paying your hard earned cash for this unit . As for me I moved to a Canon i9100 - Lets see if this fares any better .  
1	  I had this unit for about a week before it died . It was plugged into a surge protector .  
2	  I bought this for myself after our son , who is in college told me about the one he 'd purchased . I liked his , but it was WAY too small for my older eyes ! I did some research , and found this one . It 's fantastic . If you are looking to purchase an MP3 player , be careful , because not all of them are expandable . This particular little gadget is perfect for all my needs . No more skipping , like you have with a CD player ! It 's easy to work , and sounds fantastic . I have no regrets about buying the Rio Cali .  
2	  I 've had my Volt for about a month now , and I absolutely love it . Sound quality is great , the LCD display is large and clear , it 's not a battery drainer .. this thing is wonderful . Don't understand the people who claim to have had problems figuring out the PROG button , or the different modes .. programming a large ( 250 + song ) cd is a piece of cake . Buy this player , you won't regret it .  
1	  I bought this camera around Christmas time , and haven't been happy with it . Although the pictures do come out some-what nicely the other features of this camera are horrible . First off , when you zoom the image doesn't appear on the screen , there is simply a orange line that appears around the image . Another thing that is not satisfactory , is the way it tuns on . Instead of having a button to turn it on it has a little sliding thing . The problem with this is that it is constantly turning on in my purse / pocket . Instead of spending your money on batteries , use that money to buy a better camera !  
1	  I had originally rated this product with 5 stars ; however , over the past 3 months I have changed my mind . At first , I loved these headphones because they fit perfectly and were very comfortable for my 2 1/2 year old boy ( he does have a large head , so these were great :) ) . I bought them as a Christmas gift in 2011 to go along with his LeapPad Learning Tablet . Now it is early March 2012 and they are already not functioning properly . The sound is warped and low . They have been well taken of so I know it 's not something that we did . I am very disappointed that I bought the highly rated , expensive headphones thinking that they would last . Don't waste your money on these headphones !  
1	  This product is terrible . I cannot get the thing to stay on a station , it jumps all over the place . For some reason the FM doesn't work at all and it is built really cheap . I expected alot more for my Thirty bucks .  
1	  Broke after 2 months of use . The drive is completely dead now . The extra bulk that everyone complains about didn't bother me too much but this thing doesn't have any warranty . While it worked , it was cool .  
1	  I need a good keyboard touchpad , this inferior product jumps the cursor around opening and closing windows , someone suggested repairing the crimped USB wires inside , I repaired the wires but the problem still exists . It seems Adesso products are too flawed for consumer use . I will never purchase Adesso again and recommend buyers to beware of this company 's inferior products . Adesso deserves 0 stars but I had to choose 1  
1	  I bought this Sandisk micro SD for my Garmin GPS . What a deal ! $ 4 .. Until it didn't work . I went to Office Depot , paid $ 17 for the same thing , and it worked fine . Live and learn .  
1	  Tick , tick , tick , tick , tick .. it will get you too ! It lurks within . The dreaded H07 ( after four years ) finally struck my Panasonic down . Based on the dozens of messages below , there is no recourse . Thus , I 'm taking a hammer to it this evening - should be fun ! If you own one , it 's only a matter of time . If you just bought one - take it back ! Run to the store ! Panasonic is laughing at you .  
1	  When the speakers came , they were wonderful . For a little price I got a good quality sound . But after a week it is annoying . I 'm very dissapointed .. I didn't expect a miracle , but now the speakers cannot be used at all . Another thing : they didn't arrive with a USB cord as other people said ( not a seller 's problem since after buying them , I realized the USB was not included ) .  
1	  This is the most profoundly flawed maching Apple has ever produced . If you look on CraigsList in any major city , you will find unfortunate " early adopters " putting them up for sale . Apart from the " gee whiz " factor of new technology , bright screen and cool styling , it is virtually useless as a modern computer . 1 . HEAT : my MBP was so hot I could not keep my hands on the laptop or keypads . In fact the underside MELTED PLASTIC . That means it can coaglulate protein ( i.e. burn flesh ) before long . This is well documented by unhappy users all over the web and hundreds of powerbooks have been replaced . Supposedly there are " cool " machines out there , or maybe only people with very cold hands . The machine should have never been released with this unresolved heat issue . 2 . NOISE : there are 3 or 4 intolerable noise issues on these computers . I have had all of them , and all are , again , well documented on discussion groups . There is a high-pitched whine on the right side of the computer when the powercord is not plugged in ( supposedly the screen inverter ) . There is the " mooing " or " distant buzz saw " sound , either of fans or processers happening at various times . And when the heat gets high enough , very irritating buzzing fans can be heard in any quiet room-across the room ! 3 . SLEEP ISSUES : screen black on coming out of sleep , refuses to wake up , complete crash ( automatic restart ) on coming out of sleep . 4 . USB ; various incompatibilities ( as reported on discussion groups ) . For example , on all my printers , I now have to go into sleep mode , or even restart the computer completely , in order to have my printer be recongized by the computer . 5 . SLOW : this is MUCH SLOWER than previous powerbooks , because of non-native applications .. i.e. ALL THE IMPORTANT ONES . If you use InDesign , Photoshop , etc . be prepared for spinning beach balls .. as much as THREE TIMES longer for certain actions , including opening a document ! Adobe Support told me directly : " We do not support ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS that are running on a MacBookPro . We did not hear about them until you guys did .. we had no prior warning . " But also even finder activites , lke ejecting a connected firewire drive , are slower and sluggish . Changing applications takes forever . INSTABILITY.Many more crashes , hangs and forced quits than the same software and OS software running on my old G4 . SERVICEApple has done everything to deny all the above and make it difficult for users to get any kind of satisfaction , relief or resolution . In short , the once user friendly Apple has finally matched the arrogance and diffidence of Microsoft and Quark . Save yourself a lot of grief friends , and stay away from the MacBookPro debacle !  
2	  Great product . It was a snap to setup with my laptop . I now have three monitors to work with which makes my work much easier and I save a ton of paper . It will pay for itself in a month .  
2	  I bought my Palm Vx almost a month ago . In that time , I 've come to depend on it to manage my day to day life . I 've always had problems remembering appointments , and now my Palm Vx reminds me of everything that I used to forget . The Palm Vx itself is very light and very small ( it fits easily in my hand , but I have big hands ) . The screen is crystal clear and crisp . It is really easy to see the screen even in less than optimal lighting . The backlight is also easy to read in very little light or in no light at all . In all other conditions , if the screen is too hard to read normally , I 've found that holding the screen at a slightly different angle helped , depending on the lighting . Battery life is stated at about a month . I think that is battery life if you don't use it at all . I usually end up using my Palm about an hour or two a day , and at that rate , a full charge will last for about 7-8 days before the battery needs to recharge . For most people , this won't be a problem , since putting the Palm into the sync cradle charges the battery . If you charge it everyday , it will only take 5-10 minutes , but if you charge once a week like I do , it will take an hour or two . Overall , I am very happy with my Palm Vx and wouldn't trade it in for a Windows CE device even if someone paid me . It only took an hour or two to become proficient in Graffitti , and all of the included applications are extremely easy and intuitive . I would have to give this three thumbs up .  
2	  The cable works great with my iphone 5 . The length is several inches longer than the Apple supplied cable which is great because the apple cable is too short . The lightning connector is about the same size as the Apple cable . It 's sometimes a bit tight in the connection but I 'd rather have that then have it loose and coming out unexpectedly .  
1	  I bought this case along with an SD1100 camera , as the description states that it is made for it . BUT , while the camera fits , the magnetic closure is either very weak or poorly designed as it always wants to flop open . I would 've have thought that the Canon case would be of a better build quality . Now I know it 's not . I would not recommend this item .  
1	  I had a previous version of the MX500I . It worked great but the wires split at the audio connector . I hear static with the new headset .  
2	  I recently moved to Houston TX and got one of these gadgets to explore the area by myself and not have to worry about reading a map while driving . It 's great , well almost perfect . I 'll talk about the only negative points I have found using it . 1 . Driving along the interstate in the slow lane and suddenly it thinks your not on the interstate anymore , it decides that you are on the frontage road - " Off route , recalculating .. " it says . That is annoying . 2 . It sometimes decides on routes which take longer and involve more turns than required . ( But i guess if you know a better way , then go for it , it soon realises that you are off route and recalculates accordingly ) 3 . I was trying to find the nearest Outback Steakhouse from my location and the nearest one it found was 12 miles away , which is completely wrong as there is one less than 5 miles away . I suppose it can't know everything . 4 . I was stopped by the police for doing 69 in a 65 zone and the police woman spotted the Ique on my dash while writing me a warning for my speed , she asked what it was . After I told her she said that it was illeagal as of September 2003 ( in the state of Texas ) to mount any device on the dashboard which blocks any part of the drivers field of view . She wrote me another warning for that . So now the Ique sits on the arm rest in next to the drivers seat , but the signal is not half as good there and it often looses a satellite reception . All that said though , I still reccomend it to anyone who hates maps or who has a spouse who 's terrible at map reading . Once you get the hang of it , you won't be able to drive without it .  
1	  This has to be the worst keyboard I 've purchased . It 's my first wireless . I 've used and sold several keyboards and none have fealt as cheap as this . With the added snap-on plastic palm rest it sets the base up too high . Without it there is a ' hump ' where your palms go that puts your hands an an uncomfortable angle . The plastic is really bad . It feels really cheap and slick . Before I purchased this I had been trying to get in tough with Logitech about their products and compatability but they never bothered to respond . So , bad product .. company on the slide .. doesn't add up to a good value . Logitech used to be the best company out there .. or at least one of the best ..  
1	  Bought these as cheap speakers for my child 's pc . Well for 15 dollars they sounded ok but within 3 months the volume started shorting out . Now it 's gotten so bad that they are either on full blast or not on at all . If you wiggle the knob it sort of corrects the issue , for about 15 seconds .. Not even going to bother with the warranty , hardly worth shipping .  
1	  This was described as " Used " , when infact it was damaged with a bad gashon the screen and should not have been for sale .  
2	  I am by no means a professional photographer , but I really love this little camera . This is the second Canon I 've owned-the first one being a Canon PowerShot 650 , which broke when I dropped it in Ireland this summer . I would have been happier with my older model , but when I bought this one out of need , I was so happy that it had all the features of my old camera plus some new ones . This fall , I was in Japan , which gave me ample chance to really test out this little camera . When I was there , through some trial and error , I learned how to use the wide-angle , did some really cool stuff with the macro ( the " tulip " button ) and took some really , really great shots . I 'm not one to take lots of pictures of people or myself when I travel , but I like to capture cool objects . This camera is perfect for someone who is interested in the art of photography but NOT interested in shutter speeds and auto-focusing .. although , from the great success that I had with this camera , I am definately beginning to become interested in all of the above ! This camera is good for : People who want a small camera that is easy to use .. People who want to take really beautiful vacation pictures .. People who are not naturally inclined to fuss with their camera 's settings , but can if they want to .. This camera is NOT good for : Someone who cares about a ton of zoom power . Frankly , zoom shots rarely come out well . Someone who cares about a camera with a ton of megapixels . This camera 's 7.1 megapixel ability is plenty for ANYONE !  
2	  I have tried to find my original Emerson remote and could not . I then purchased 3 different universal remotes and none of them let me access my inputs so I could play my games . ThenI found the Miracle Remote . Now I know why you guys call it the Miracle remote . I just put in my batteries and it did work . It is the only remote I ever found that has the Game button to switch to games . It also works my menu and has a sleep button . I absolutley love this remote and recommend this remote to anyone .

1	  We purchased the first PDR-M25 on 5/16 . It lasted for 31 days , and then it would not turn on . Toshiba exchanged it for another camera ( same model ) . When the replacement came , it would NOT take a picture when it first came out of the box . Then it took a few pictures , and then seized up again and the shutter button would not work . Toshiba sent another camera , same model , and it lasted 61 days before it refused to focus properly and the flash got out of sync with the shutter . I am awaiting camera # 4 , as Toshiba refused to send my money back .  
2	  I was a little nervous about buying a camera with a hard drive , especially since I bought a first generation JVC hard drive camcorder and was very disppointed with it . This camera pleasantly surprised me . Video quality is excellent in bright light and still pretty good in low light . I almost didn't buy this camera based on the low light reviews , but it is not nearly as grainy as I 've read in other reviews . $ 1,400.00 is a lot to pay for a camcorder ( less if you buy it from Amazon ) , but it really is worth it . Still images are good , although I haven't yet tried to print any of the images . On screen , the still images are very good and nearly indistinguishable from my Canon SD550 . Again , the DVD burning process wasn't nearly as bad as I expected after reading some of the reviews . It took me about 10 minutes to figure out the main features of the software , and successfully burned my first movie to DVD ( in high def ) in about 1/2 hour ( about an hour after I received the camera via UPS ) . I played it on my Blu-ray player and the quality is great . I transferred everything to my 500GB external hard drive and again have 60GB free on my camera . The format is really convenient . Structurally , the camera is very small and light . I bought the super extended battery ( as a package through Amazon ) and it is quite a substantial battery . It sticks out a bunch and is quite heavy , but is worth the extra battery life . All in all , it is a great camera and I would highly recommend it to everyone . In fact , my dad is thinking of getting one now after seeing it .  
1	  Amazon lists this as better together with the Garmin C330 . It does not work with it and the Garmin C330 from amazon already comes with one . Completely worthless .  
1	  The flash drive that I received is defective . I bought is as a gift for my father and carried it across half of the world before I opened the package . All PC in the house recognized it , but in attempt to read it I receive a warning that the disk is not formatted . When I try to format the disk , I get another warning that says that the disk cannot be formatted . Instructions from Tribeca tech support did not help . Bottom line - it 's a piece of junk .  
1	  I was looking for a smaller UPS to handle small transient outages so runtime was not an issue . This looks like it would do the job so I gave it a try and sadly the loud transformer hum is noticeable 15 ' away . While such noise is expected when the unit switches in , once the battery has been charged I would expect such noise to be gone . Just keep in mind the sound if you plan on being near where you deploy this item .  
1	  What can I say , it broke after using it the 3rd time .. disappointing to say the least .. should have purchased the lowest one  
1	  I could not install this camera . I have windows vista in my computer and this camera will not function with it , Went to HP website , installed the driver update they suggested and still it did not work . Any ideas out there  
2	  Before I bought this ram upgrade for my MSI some programs were a little slow but now every webpage is fastly opened and all the other programs I installed are quicker than before . Its not so difficult to install and infact you can find many videos on the web that explain how to do it yourself .  
2	  I 'm so glad I found this product . I bought it to use on my new iHome IH15 , and it fits right in , it can charge the Shuffle or play it through the player . It does seem a little expensive for what it is , but it is a lot less expensive than buying a new iPod .  
2	  best carmera i have you most pixel for your bucks . the color application are cool too . would make a great gift  
1	  HAVE I TAKEN THINGS APART IN THE PAST AND THEY WORKED ! You better ask yourself that question before you start or your in deep doodoo . The instructions are very small and you 'll need a magnifying glass to read them AND they are not complete ! Please google taking apart an iPod before you start or you are already in trouble . I didn't disconnect one group of paper thin wires and ruined my iPod BUT I got a better unit ( read my reviews ) . My advice , its cheap BUT you better know what your getting into ..  
1	  Despite claim from manufacturer this product wouldn't interface with mac . It wouldn't load the mp3 format from itunes and it took forever to load a video . I returned it it to amazon .  
2	  I own a G2 also , but the ELPH is the one to slide in your pocket everytime . Light and small , but feels as sturdy as a block of steel in your hand . The video mode records 180 seconds per clip in 320 mode , not many other cameras can do this . Very fast cycle time between photos . Cons : None in 3 months  
2	  Not much more to say , never had a problem with the ink though I seem to go through it rather quickly .  
2	  As most of the other reviews state , this really is a 5 star keboard . I can find no fault with it other than it may possbily be TOO comfortable ! I purchased this keyboard for use at work as this is where 75 % of my computer usage occurs . It can take a little while to get used to if you 've never used an ergonomic keyboard in the past as the curvature and split key configuration is a bit different . Is just so happens that I 've actually been able to increase my typing and at the same time , keep my wrists and hands in a more natural position . Through dumb luck , I was able to get this keyboard for $ 22 from one of the independant sellers ( they changed the listing the day after I bought ) and I must say I would have paid $ 100 for this luxury .  
2	  The card installed easily and has worked flawlessly . This card can easily handle any game you throw at it ! The only problem with ATI as a company is they are slow on getting drivers out . So if you buy their newest card and it wasn't designed for your operating system you will have a fustrating wait for several weeks , so it is better to go with a card that is about 3 steps down from the " latest & greatest " - plus it is alot cheaper too !  
1	  This item broke after 11 uses and stopped working with the radio at that point I discarded it I won't purchase it again  
1	  First of all let me comment upon the good , the function of the device . The earphone sound is fair with the main issue being inability to get it positioned correctly . The microphone is good with clear sound , good placement and great sound isolation . The USB connector was recognized easily and set up without problem in Skype . Unfortunately , the rest is bad . The swivel on the earpiece is annoying , it swiveled into the wrong position often when I tried to put it in and tended not to stay put when I turned my head . The flexible ear hook is a little too wimpy . Sure its comfortable , because its so loose it likes to fall off . Also , although I havent had it long enough to have it fail yet , the cable from the headset to the 2.5mm jack is of the cheap two-wires connected together kind that has failed for me many times in the past . Oh and between the USB connector and the headset there is way too much cord , enough that I taped all the USB cord around the the dongle thing , which is quite large . So to summarize , bad fit , cheap wire , good microphone , USB connector too large and with too much cord .  
2	  I can only listen to this at 1/3 max volume . Heart-throbbing base indeed , and at 67 % of the original 2001 shelf price . Old technology-I did not wince at . While I may be pleased as punch with the audio capacity of this devise , I still am not altogether pleased with the fact that it was a USED item , and that was not indicated on the Amazon ad page .  
2	  I love these things ! I bought my first one in high school , about 8 years ago . It still works flawlessly . Bought the new one a few months ago , and I 'm in love all over again . With almost 200 CDs , this is the only way to organize them ! I typed up all my albums onto a word processor , printed and laminated the sheet instead of having to scribble all of them onto the provided paper . Just a tip .  
2	  I was extremely happy with the Tamrac 5273 - holds everything I have and offers great protection . It is easy to carry and when you are able to stand in one place for a while and experiment it acts like a easy access protective tray for the different lenses and filters . My first camera only backpack and I am really liking it .  
2	  The recorder has performed just as I expected . The sound quality is fine , the controls are intuitive and easy to operate , and battery life is acceptable . I especially like the three recording modes , so you can do dictation , record a one-on-one discussion or podcast , or a large lecture , and get good sound quality with the proper mode set . No complaints .  
2	  I got a great deal on this subwoofer . i used this to replace a 10 year old jensen sub in my dodge durango . I was blown away by the difference . The jensen sounded good , untill I put this Rockford in . I just have one , in a sealed box , in the back of a durango , and it still hits hard as a rock . The bass is tight , clear , and zero distortion . For reference , im powering it with a small kenwood amp ( kac5204 ) it rates at the same watts as this sub , and its the perfect combo . If u want a reliable tight sounding sub , this is the one . UPDATE : WOW , i got this sub for 32 dollars , now its 99 ? go to crutchfield its only 79 there .  
1	  This product comes with no instructions I have yet to find a lense that it accurately fits  
2	  The Targus Ultra Mini Optical Mouse ( TUMOM ) is an amazing piece of hardware . Its convenient size and weight make it just another competitor in the laptop mouse field , but what sets it apart from the crowd is its cord . Not only is the cord extremely thin and light-weight , but you can make the length anywhere from six inches to about two feet and then retract it down to nothing for transport . It 's almost like having a wireless mouse , but without the added initial cost or the ongoing cost of batteries . Having the second mouse button is a big bonus for Macintosh laptop users ; the third button ( depressing the scroll wheel ) is great too ( mine is programmed for Expos & eacute ; ' s " view all windows " feature ) . There are a couple caveats , but these are probably going to hold true for any laptop optical mouse , not just the TUMOM . When I plugged the mouse into my PowerBook ( in battery power mode ) it sucked about 20 minutes off the clock , which then kept dropping at an accelerated rate . Although it seems to have ergonomic styling , over use of the mini mouse will probably result in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome , so be careful out there . I 've only had my TUMOM for a couple days , so I can't speak to its longevity ( so far , so good ) . I 've had a hard time convincing my three-year-old that it 's not a toy ( I 've had a hard time convincing * myself * it 's not a toy - it 's just so fun to extend the cord .. retract the cord .. extend the cord .. etc . ) . The silver finish perfectly complements my Aluminum PowerBook ( I briefly considered a Microsoft laptop mouse that was also silver , but , hello .. evil ) . I was initially concerned that the retractable widget would get in the way while moving the mouse , but that hasn't been a problem . My previous favorite computer gadget was the Lexar 128MB USB JumpDrive , but this makes that look soo last year ( which it was ) . This is truly a gadget lover 's dream .  
1	  The sound quality is not good . The scroll dial is not easy to deal with . The volume function is very touchy . It is located in the center dial and it 's also used to " stop " . It 's almost like a " joystick " , so if you are not careful , you are constantly turning unit on and off instead of lowering or raising the volume . I have had many voice recorders , and although I like the ease and capability it has to save on the computer , I like the Sony product much better for sound quality and ease of use .  
1	  Please be wary of the " good " reviews . They are people who just bought the product and haven't had much experience with it . I have experience with the product . I bought my player 4 months ago and loved it , at first . But this morning I too got the dreaded H03 error . And .. I can't do a darn thing about it . Normally , I 'd return it under warranty repair and pay my $ 90 . But , I 'm sitting in Iraq right now , without my receipt to " prove " when I purchased it . I can't even pick up the phone and call Panasonic because I 'll be on hold more than the 15 minutes I 'm allotted weekly , like I 'll use those precious phone calls for them versus my family . And I could pay the money and it still happen again in another 4 months while I 'm here .. So I 'm stuck with it - be aware , so it doesn't happen to you too . I 'm ordering another brand today and being done with it .. So Panasonic .. you 're messing with the troops now too ! And I 'm mad !  
1	  Out of 50 , I was able to burn six CD 'S , an 88 % failure rate .  
2	  Worked fine to transfer all data from the hard drive before sending my laptop in for repairs . I didn't need to go through driver installation procedures on the enclosed disk , just plugged it in and it was ready to go .  
1	  The picture is a power supply , the item is a power cord for a laptop .  
1	  I inserted the color cartridge into the printer and three weeks later I needed a new one . I was gone two of those three weeks on vacation and did not print anything in color the other week . Where did the ink go ? Just asking ..  
2	  It works well and fills my room with music . It also charges your ipod . The only tiny problem is that you have to take of the ipod case in order for it to plug in .  
1	  I would not consider myself as a hard core Audiophile but I am certainly headed that way . Let me share with you first of how many things I am listening to ( same type of content generally but different outlets to hear from ) In the Gymrecently moved from the [ Bose TriPort In-Ear Headphones - Headphones ( ear-bud ) - black toSennheiser PMX60 Headphonesin both cases being played on theApple iPod shuffle 2 GB Blue ( 2nd Generation ) ORApple iPod Video 60 GB Black MA147LL / A ( 5th Generation ) The bose definitely has deeper base but Sennheiser delivers on loudness . Someone had complained earlier that its too loud where other can hear around you . I find this to be a feature actually because the gym showers don't have and sound or music there . Just crank these up and you can instantly hear music ! In the car ( 2006 Lexus GS300 ) There is very good sound imaging in this card mark & Levinson ; system . So I really enjoy that clarity in the car via the native CD changer . The home studio : Podcaststudio Firewire BundleIn the living RoomWell the living room is the grand slam setup of : Polk Audio Monitor Series CS2 Center Channel Speaker ( Single , Black ) So sadly this review has turned into a listing of my stuff . So to make things simpler : These headphones are noAudio-Technica ATH-ANC7 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling Headphoneson an airplane obviously but they are perfect for those heavy and fast workouts ! I was worried that on some exercises this will hurt my neck or something but doing everything in the gym from aerobics to glider run , it fits well and sounds great ! Of course the price is just right as well . If your looking for something that will compliment your listening all around , these headphones will do the trick . UPDATED STATUS - DONT GET THESE ! They last about 1 yearThis set despite its sound quality prowess , did not last a full year ! The year barrel and the inside tweeter just came off ! Next thing i know it got yanked out of their place - it looks really crappy ! i am so sad cause i had love the sound in these and comfort . Let me enlist what i have tried so far : Apple Earbuds ( White with Gray Earbuds ) these just kept falling offBose In-Ear Headphonesthese just kept falling off + they developed gunk on the plastics after a while of usage ( but the sound is awesome ) Sennheiser PMX60 HeadphonesWell these sadly just broke under a year ! but amazing sound ! Now will try theSennheiser CX380 Sport Series II Noise Isolating Earphonesafter reading several hands on reviews of people ! Will let you guys know how it works out . In the meantime don't forget to check out [ .. ]  
1	  When i first got this printer i already new that i would use mostly for printing pictures on regular paper . well that has come out to be true , but wow i was wrong . the quality is extremely bad the pixels are sometimes as big as a millimeter by a milimeter ! as for scanning , i could say that it 's exeptional , but i don't use that feature much . copying is average at best . Text printing is the WORST there letters are like fraing blobbs . as for faxing a havent found any issues exept for speed which is a little slow . Now tha ti have had it with this printer i am getting a epson c82 because thats all i really need and the quality is very good , thats what i would recomend to you , or if you want these features i would recomend the epson cx5200 for only $ .. which is twice as cheap as this and at least twicew as good .  
2	  I am a very big guy , 6x shirts and i bought this in hopes it would stretch or add material to it to make it fit , But there was no need , i opened the package and moved all adjustments to the max and put it on , i actually had to tighten it back up it was to loose . Only down fall of this product is the attachment doesnt fit my NIKON Action EX 8x40 8.2 degree waterproof binoculars . This product does come with two small key ring like adapters to assist in this problem but here is the problem .. The only way to attach them on my set is to use the provided strip ties to secure the rings to the binoculars and then attack the harness to that 1 ) very cheasy way to attach to a very expensive set of binoculars and 2 ) the one zip tie broke during instal so now i have to find another way to attaching my harness . The good part is i don't think it will be to difficult just have to head to the store and find something . If i had to do it all over again i would buy these in a heart beat just do to the size and the solid construction . 5 stars  
2	  Almost as good as the very good 595s . These are a real bargain . Easy to drive . IPOD friendly . Comfortable . Well made . Good SQ . Seem to be durable . Sound is not as laid back as 650s or many other Senns . Still , I wish it had just a bit more punch ( I like rock ) .  
2	  This mount worked perfectly for our 23 " HDTV in our nursery . Very sturdy and heavy . All required hardware was included .  
2	  I had purchased a cheaper cable , and it was terrible , then I saw this one , and was skeptical about the higher price ( Only like $ 3 more ) and decided to get it . I am yet to say or learn about any negative aspect of this cable , the video output is clear , the cable is of VERY high quality . I repair computers , and needed a vga cable to connect to my monitor , and with my screen 's native resolution of 1900x1200 , this cable displays that resolution ultra clear with no fuzz or lines ! WILL purchase again and recommend !  
2	  I plugged it into my panasonic cordless phone and it worked like a charm . The sound is clear , the headset is comfortable , and I can hear quite well also . What else is there for me to say ?  
1	  Most annoying piece of hardware that I have used . Pointer tracking , The most important of mouse 's function , it does a worse job .  
2	  I didn't find this one before I wrote a review then I posted to the 320GB . Here it is . I bought two acomdata 160GB external HD . The quality is very good , very reliable , never feel hot whenever I touch the shell . One is very quiet , another has clear sound but still ok . I never opened the box to see which company 's hard disk is inside it , but my two years use already comfort me this is a good product that can be relied on .  
1	  Beware of this false advertising scam ! I ordered this toner cartridge which carries the picture and description of the genuine OEM article , but they sent a cheap " compatible " substitute !  
2	  I got this tv just before christmas 2006 . I got it from circuit city for $ 1299 + tax ( after asking them to do a price match with fry 's ) . I also had a $ 100 cupon of circuit city so i ended up paying $ 1199 + tax = $ 1330 for this brand new TV . It is fantastic . Setup is very simple . Colors are very bright but one problem that i face is with dark scenes . Dark scenes look very dark on this tv . but besides that the tv is excellent . I had to get monster cable to make DVD signal look richer on the television . Two thumbs up for this tv .  
1	  I found this in a discount store in NYC and since it was cheap so I bought it . After a day I returned it and got a good refund , because if I had it longer I 'd have thrown it out of the window or burned it on my stove . ( Background : for those not in the know , Coby is a small Korean company that peddles low-quality electronics . They are known for low cost and , surprise ! , low quality . ) The DVD recorder was supposed to let you burn video source materials onto DVD blanks , but as much as I tried I couldn't get it to work . About 30 seconds after I pressed Record it would give this vibrating noise and then eventually I had to unplug it . The exterior of the recorder also does not inspire confidence at all : one of the buttons on the front didn't quite work . Seriously , save yourself the money and buy something that works , like the popular Panasonic DMR-E55S or DMR-E55K . The Coby isn't worth the frustrations even if it were given away for free .  
1	  I would not recommend buying this printer . Mine is only 4000 copies old , has already gone through 3 toner cartridges , and emits a high-pitched earsplitting squeal when printing . Since it was still under warranty , I got Sharp to exchange it . Sharp customer service is fast and pleasant , but the problem remains unsolved . The replacement ( refurbished ) machine is even louder . I can't pinpoint the origin of the noise , except to say it is not the scanner unit . My guess is either the paper exit roller or the drum . The drum is not guaranteed , but should certainly last longer than 4000 copies . It also eats large quantities of toner while producing copies that are way too light . It is also considerably slower than the 12 sheets a minute it is rated .  
1	  This is the perfect example of excellent marketing pushing an inferior product to market . The consumer is fooled into thinking that this " hard case " is actually hard and is actually made of alumunim , when in fact the case is made of PLASTIC and has two VERY thin strips of aluminum outside the plastic . This case could easily crack under little pressure . I purchased this case but was greatly disappointed by the plastic composition and flimsiness of the case . For 40 bucks you think you 'd get something nice and strong , but save your hard-earned money for some other case . If you want just something to protect your Palm V in , I 'd strongly suggest something with a leather cover that is far more durable than this plastic case . Even better , go for the leather case that has a zipper . For even more protection , go for the Rhinoskin Palm protectors . Those are a little bit more expensive but are definitely worth the money , considering the amount of money it costs to replace your Palm if you damage it . The only reason why you should buy this flimsy , overpriced " hard case " is if you have a LOT of money to blow , care more about looks than functionality , and don't care if your Palm actually gets damaged . This case will pop open when you don't expect it , and who knows what will happen to your Palm 's panel .  
2	  We purchased a new camera about a month before we went on vacation so we would have time to get used to it before we left . We could have bought it the DAY we left , it is so user friendly ! The menus are easy to navigate , and set up is a breeze . We chose this camera based on 1 . anti-shake 2 . Size & overall ease of use 3 . Screen size . 4 . location and ease of pushing function buttons on camera ( husband 's man-sized fingers & my small fingers ) 5 . Bestshot features and video ability . This is the first camera we have owned without an optical viewfinder - we don't miss it . The screen is clear and bright , easy to see in sunshine . Before purchasing this camera , we also considered a couple of Canon models . Only thing that would make this camera more perfect would be a bit more zoom , but you can't have everything I guess . Love the red color , too . Pictures from the vacation and subsequent shots have turned out amazing ! We are very happy with the results . Battery life was terrific also . Some would recommend having an additional battery just in case , but we don't and didn't need one while the camera got heavy use on vacation ( 700 + pictures and video taken over 8 days ) . Just recharge in the dock at night , ready to go the next day . Very easy to slip in a purse or pocket , but not too lightweight for good " hand feel " . After the trip , my father couldn't stop talking about the camera to his friends . Infact , it impressed us and him so much , we bought one for Dad for Christmas , in a different color of course . We highly recommend this camera ! A great value for the price !  
1	  I needed a radio I could use to pickup a weak station next to a stong one . This one keep switching between stations . I returned it .  
1	  First of all the good : the device works fairly well . Only fairly well , because it is routinely confused and tells me to bear right when it should say left . ( there 's a three spots going down into Tacoma and another by Bellevue which I always have to watch close ) The bad part ? Updating the software and / or the maps is confusing , if it 's even possible at all . An hour was as long as I was willing to devote to the task before I gave up and just accepted that whatever maps it came with , that 's what it 'll have until I throw it away . What should have been simple ended up require 2 different registrations and 2 different codes on their website before they would release current maps . ( Who do they think is going to take their maps , that doesn't have their device ? The map data is useless without one .. ) When I finally recieved the data , it didn't work . Typical corporate philosophy : the shorter it 's lifespan , the sooner you 'll have to buy another one .  
2	  I 've been a Linksys owner for nearly 7 years , and I always enjoyed their products . But that time , I looked for a Gb router + N wireless . Then there is not much of a choice . Also it looks like the Linksys quality drops since they 've been acquired , so I decided to buy my first D-link . The overall experience so far is very positive . Very easy to setup via the web interface ( although some menus might look a bit confusing ) , it worked out of the box . I liked some minor features like binding an IP to a MAC address ( very usefull if you want to share a printer among several OS , including old Windows 2000 , who are not too good at detecting printers on the network ) makes managing your home office network easy . I notice that in mix mode ( N + A / B / G ) , windows 2000 will freeze or crash . No issue for windows XP , Vista , and Mac . Meaning , if you want to take advantage of the N-wireless , better to update your OS 's . There are plenty of customization that gamers will love , where you can prioritize network ressources to specific application . No use for me , but worth mentionning . I strongly recommend that product !  
2	  I was looking for a portable CD / tape player for a gift and at this price , I could afford to be generous . I was concerned about the white / blue / black casing , but when I opened the box , I thought the unit was quite attractive and much better looking than in the picture . I have a JVC boombox and expected this portable would have slow , smooth opening CD and tape doors and not the " pop " opening quality of other portables ; I was not disappointed . There isn't much you can do on a portable without an equalizer , but the multiple sound settings ( beat / pop / clear / flat ) did improve the sound quality . The sound was adequate for a bedroom . The delivery was also excellent : I ordered this JVC boombox on Friday and it was delivered by Tuesday a . m . I would recommend this unit .  
2	  Love this new camera ! Since I received it 4 weeks ago , it has been my constant companion . The learning curve was quick . Ergonomically , it fits in hand like a glove . Love the larger display screen , love the ease of menu options and quick change settings . At first I thought switching from regular 35mm and digital point and shoot would be difficult .. but I was wrong . Canon makes it an easy transition with this camera . Things that used to take hours in the darkroom or one would have to just rely on that the lab would get right , you can easily do both right on the camera and then fine tune later on your computer software . Love the B & W ; and sepia tone options ! They have said that the 10.1mp don't make that much of a difference over the 8mp models .. but I notice it . Fine details are clearer and remain so after cropping and enlarging . I cannot wait to add other lenses and extras . Photographic freedom ! This camera allows you to be ' creative ' without worrying so much about the technical aspects .  
1	  I got this printer for school , and after the first few months , it would not print in color for more than 2 days after replacing the cartridge . Plus anytime you change a cartridge , it prints a test page that uses up a lot of ink . It 's loud , and would wake my roommate up in the mornings . The best thing about this printer is that it can provide great stress relief . At the end of the second year , I took it outside and beat it to a pulp with a hammer , along with a friend of mine who had problems with her printer , also an HP . Bottom line . HP printers are NOT worth the money .  
1	  I 've owned 2-3 of these cable releases . They work fine .. but the rubber cable cover on the camera end weakens with usage , causing the cable to bend and exposing the wires . Once that happens , the cable can misfire just by moving the camera . This release needs a stronger rubber covering on the end that attaches to the camera . Other photographers have also complained about the same defect .  
2	  I humped this thing around DC last week for 7 hours , and not a worry to mention . Well balanced , I had it full of a camera , 4 lenses , flash and miscellany . I cut all the extra straps off , and just have the shoulder harness left . And it looks good too . Of course , it 's a great advertisement for thieves so never let it out of your grip .  
2	  bought this mainly to use as a protector for a lense . Can't really tell a difference that it makes in the photograph but it does a good job of keeping the front lens clean and clear of scratches .  
1	  Bought the Zenith Z50PX2D in July of 2006 . Tonight the infamous POP occured . After doing a search for what the problem could be , I 've realized there are TOO many malfunctions with this product . I called the LG support , tech guy basically said too bad . But was kind enough to offer me phone numbers to service centers which are over 100 miles from my home . No way will I pay to have this thing repaired , as so many others have spent more money only to have it POP again within days or months . Not only is it a disgrace for a company to knowinly manufacture such a defective prodcuct , it is a shame on how many tons of trash this TV is adding to our landfills . If anyone knows of a class action lawsuit has been filed , or knows how to start one , please contact me .  
2	  This camera is old . There is pretty much no way you are going to buy it . However , when mine does eventually die , I will buy another one , and here is why . This camera provides crisp pictures in most lighting and manageable pictures in low lighting . It is quick and responsive . It takes great macro photos . With the underwater case , it can survive almost anything . It plays slideshows which you can add mp3 music to . However , this camera 's real excellence is in its durability . I originally bought this camera in November of 2006 . It is June 2012 now , so in a few months , that will be 6 years . This camera has survived a summer in the Greek Islands , 5 Mardi Gras Seasons , 5 Neon Glow Paint Party raves ( where both I and the camera are being constantly exposed to a water-based paint ) , and a foam party . It has survived heat , cold , moisture , and an incredible amount of general abuse . As I now have a serious DSLR in addition to this camera , I generally only use my Sony DSC N-2 for things that I 'm afraid could hurt my weather sealed DSLR . Every time I am convinced I have killed it , I wait for it to dry out and is surprises me by coming back to life . Like I said , it is old , and I 'm sure you can get something similar or better for a good price . But I won't . I 'll be buying this again whenever mine eventually gives out .  
2	  I have this router since January 2009 . Initially I have bought it for a friend in 2008 and one year after , I have bought back the router to my friend ( 50 % cheaper than new , of course ! ) . The last time that I have powered off the router was 94 days ago and at this time the router never have had a crash or any problem . Of course , since the first day that I bought this router I have installed DD-WRT that brings stability and lots of functionality to the router . I have tested many Buffalo and Linksys 802.11N routers and the coverage is very poor compared with de WRT54GL , that is at least 40 % better than similar routers with 2 external antennas . If you want stability and you don't mind if it looks like an " old school " router this is the best router on earth for home and small business customers . I never have had to reset this router by a crash . Finally , if you want a Wireless N router I recomend that you first do a search on the DD-WRT database and confirm if the router that you want to buy is supported to install DD-WRT . Regards from Costa Rica .  
1	  This antenna didn't do much for us - it worked slightly better than our rabbit ears . It pulled in the signals less than 6 miles away but couldn't do much with those 6 + , which is similar to rabbit ears .  
1	  I use a Sony RZ Pentium 4 2.80 GHz with a Linksys wireless USB link . This computer comes without a serial port that 's why I had to install a Serial Port . The drivers installation were fine , and it did work ( with some , not all applications ) but when I turned off the computer and turned on again the system stopped recognizing the wireless USB , I restarted the system 5 times until it occured to me that it was something about the belkin port , then I unplugged and restarted and presto ! the Linksys worked again , however , now even with the belkin Port unplugged I have to plug-off and plug-in the Linksys card in order to be able to access the lan . I other words , the Belkin installation spoiled my Wireless connection . Be aware that this product may conflict with some of your USB devices , and since some applications wouldn't work I would try another alternative as a PCI serial port card or a USB to Serial cable from another manufacturer .  
1	  Product was defective-the sensor had a large black spot in all the pictures ( not due to dirt / grease etc ) . Disappointing quality-not what one might expect from a Nikon .  
1	  I just spent 3 hours with tech support and was finally informed that this unit is not supported by XP SP3 . They are working on compatibility problems with another product , thus this is not on the current queue for upgrade . EXTREMELY disappointing support from a company such as cisco .  
2	  I bought this MP3 player for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas and I have not been disappointed . She uses it constantly and loves it ! I am the one who puts the music on it for her and have not had any problem with this . The player comes with software to effectively and easily organize , add , and create playlists . My daughter had no trouble learning to use the player . About five minutes of instruction from me and she was on her way to learning the rest on her own . The player has great sound and is especially great for little fingers because of the small joystick operation . The picture and video quality on this player is fantastic as well . I have about 250 songs on her player already and there is still tons of memory space left . Excellent all around ! I would recommend the following accessories : colorful skin to both protect and jazz up your player , a DC charger for times when you can't charge using the USB on your computer , and a carrying case as the one supplied with the player is a small bag and is difficult to get everythig into . Don't hesitate to buy !  
2	  Cable came right on time and is a robust cable of top quality . Despite its length , which allows me to sit on my couch and project my computer onto my 58 " Plasma HDTV across the room , the signal is perfect . And the result is stunning - my slide shows and videos are crystal clear . I recommend this cable and this provider .  
2	  I know many people say that the canon 's are the best , but I have found that for the money and simplicity the sony 's are the best bet . I would suggest however that if you can take dealing with a bigger camera you should buy it . The smaller these camera 's get the more they struggle to keep the image quality up . Many think that just because of the higher megapixel ability the image will be higher quality . That is not the case . The lense on a small camera can't keep up . The Carl Zeiss lens with Sony however does a good job , but it can't compete with a bigger camera of similar quality .  
2	  Item worked as advertised . Item arrived just two days after the order was placed . Only weak point - It came with no paperwork which would have been unhandy in case of a problem . Garmin USB Cable  
1	  These Dynex cassette adapters were once good products - I 've owned a couple of them in the past . But , like all of these cassette adapters , the thin cord eventually goes bad and you have to replace them . Which is just what I did recently . However , Dynex must have produced a LARGE bad batch of these , because the new one I got was awful . Loud hissing and droning came from the speakers , and the volume coming from the iPod was so low that I had to turn the volume on the tape deck up all the way to even hear it .. which made the hissing , droning background noise overpowering . Obviously it was defective . But when I returned it and exchanged it for another one , the new one had the same problem . I had to get my money back . Dynex , get some quality control and fix these !  
1	  I used to have an Olympus Camedia 4100 , and decided to switch to a smaller camera with the same resolution . The performance of this Nikon is really disappointing . In auto-focus mode , photos mostly turn out blurry ( which never happened with my old Olympus ) . The camera does offer different settings for different types of shots ( portrait , indoor , outdoor , sunset etc . ) , but only portrait generally produces crispness comparable to what I am used to .  
2	  Excellent performance for home use . Fast to connect and easy to use , printer and scanner .  
1	  This camera will take amazing pictures , and the 2.5 inch LCD is quite impressive . However , I definately would not buy it again . After 13 months of having the dscw1 , it malfunctioned beyond personal repair , and Sony customer service is a joke . The warrenty ran out a month ago . And sony wants $ 171 to fix a camera that I paid $ 350 for . I am quite upset with the situation , but there 's not much that I can do . Just take my advice , and go don't buy this camera ; it was not meant to last .  
1	  I 've owned a Lexmark Z33 for about a year and a half , and I 've had problems with it beginning after a few months of purchasing it . The main problems are the ink cartridges and the print quality . Not only does each one cost almost half the price of what I paid for the printer but they dry up rather quickly . Currently I 'm having print quality issues where there are white lines running horizontally throughout printed text . This results in the text being pretty difficult to read . I 've repeatedly tried their online troubleshooting solutions without success . The sharpness of the printouts diminishes with time . I didn't buy this printer with high expectations - all I do is print out a few word documents and articles off the internet . But I 'm pretty disappointed in Lexmark after purchasing this printer . After all , it 's a pretty inexpensive printer but if this is an example of the quality of printers Lexmark turns out , it 's pretty bad . I 'm looking to purchase a new printer now , and if you are to , don't waste your time purchasing a Lexmark !  
1	  Easy to install , but annoying to use . Seems to have a delay before the cursor moves , then kind of catches up to you .  
2	  I had a pair of these for about a month when I found my two year old boy chewing on them . :( So this is my second pair . Sound quality is much better than the Sony earbuds I replaced ( cats got a hold of those ones . :( ) Ive had some of Sennheisers over-the-ear headphones in the past and they performed beyond my expectations . The first pair I had lasted around seven years or so . Im not what youd call an audiophile but maybe more of a thrifty shopper . I know not to be too cheap , but also know not to blow over a hundred bucks on a set of earbuds ( no offense to those who do . )  
1	  I don't know the problem is because of Nero 7 or DVD burner or my machine ! but I am not able to solve it and non of the customer services ( Sony or Nero ) are able to solve it too . the problem is after burning the DVD the quality of picture is very bad which I guess it is because of the interlacing . I paid 60 dollors extra to upgrade Nero 7 to full version but still I am not able to burn my DVD ( which I am getting with my Panasonic Camcorder and while playing back with camcorder is perfect ) . so I don't recommend this product at all .  
1	  I bought this unit from QVC about six months ago . I have really never been able to set this up . I have a tv with all the connections but have no idea how to set this up . I have tried many different ways & when I do either one part of the setup works or none of it works . When I put it to DVD Live / TV the picture is all snowy . Anybody have any ideas on how to give me easy directions on what the correct way to set this up is . I also bought Monster cables for the Component setup & that doesn't seem to work either . When QVC had this on they said it was an easy setup . I will never buy another Cyberhome product again . JUNK , JUNK , JUNK !  
2	  I don't personally own one of these , but I have messed with them in the stores . I don't believe all that bad stuff thats being said about this . Like for instance , one review I have read , was that the people who have perviously used Ipods would have trouble with the Zune . Actually the zune is easier to navigate with . Instead of missing your song every time on the ipod you can just click down .. My cousin has a Ipod and I couldn't get to the song I wanted very easily . The only ones I have played with are the brown .. Thats a CON , When your looking at the brown Zune you can see a green border like thing on it . If you go up and look at it you will notice it too . Yet , I don't personally think Apple has much to worry about . For christmas its either been the Ipod ( which has games ) , or the Zune ( which has a big screen ) . I have now got to mess around with it and its easy to use and the picture on it is great .. This is one thing thats a awesome gift idea !  
1	  Bought this to replace a D-Link router that is getting flaky and spent an entire frustrating afternoon with it . IP obtained , no network capability . Updated the firmware even , no help . The website offered advice on resolving that in no way matched any software either available on the website , or the software that came with the product . Finally I plugged back in my D-Link and am temporarily back in business - will look elsewhere for a solution . At least the D-link came with understandable software and a website that is comprehensible .  
1	  i purchased this dvd player for a trip with my kids to hawaii - they used it on the plane to hawaii and that was it - just after a year i got it out of the cupboard to take on another trip and it was broken - it would not play the dvd - i called audiovox and they wanted over $ 90 to fix it - what a joke - i barely paid $ 120 for it - i would never buy another audiovox electronic again - what a waste of money  
1	  This card is not compatible with 1.0 compliant AGP . The confusing thing is you think 2.0 compliant is 2x , it is not . I called costomer service before buying this card . I had asked if 2.0 compliant was the same as 2x , she said ' right ' , that 's was her only word ! She odviously didn't know what she was talking about . I like Creative products , it 's not that , I have the SBLive X-Gamer and it 's excellent but I bought my PC only last year and this Anhilator 2 should be compatible with 1.0 slots but it isn't . Most other top of the line cards ( Voodoo 5 ) are 1.0 compliant and AMD super7 compatible . I give it an extra star because it is said to be good on 2.0 AGP systems . No stars on mine because it doesn't work .  
1	  It does what it should be doing ( privacy ) , but you will pay the price : the screen become way to reflective ( I can see myself in it even with regular daylight ) . If you 're working only in the darkness or doesn't mind extra " mirror-effect " then it will work for you . Otherwise I can't recommend this filter . Returning it ..  
2	  I gave this item a 5 star based on the written description . I will beable to further review this item if something where to happen to my iPod .  
1	  I ordered this rewinder because the idea of it made sense . Why let my camera do the grunt-work ? The maxell wasn't the cheapest , but still pretty cheap , and even tho the reviews were not favorable , I tend to have good luck with stuff so I figured , why not me ? And I could save $ 30 over the more expensive rewinders . Upon attempting to use it , I experienced exactly what some other customers experienced : the " rewind " button stuck down , the thing tried to eat my tape , and it never did anything remotely electrical besides niftily remove about $ 17 from my wallet . If you think you need one of these , send me your $ 17 and I 'll send you a CD I don't like instead . Your chances of being pleased with your purchase is much higher .  
1	  I selected this item at no cost to myself as part of an employee award program mainly for entertainment value for the kids . It is a very fun item with the flashing lights , bubbling neon looking lights and mini jukebox shape , so keep in mind this item is only for the light and young at heart . It adds fun to a small room quite well which is what it is supposed to do , so I guess it 's a success . Where I disagree with the first two reviewers is regarding the sound quality . It has one four-inch full range paper speaker for each channel and the sound reflects this basic cheapness . Of course if has no bass at all and with an external power supply providing only 14 volts and 2 amps , bass is not possible . The lack of bass I can understand but the lack of crisp highs and any sort of detail I cannot . The sound is below the standard of most computer speakers . The sound cannot come close even to $ 100 iPod docking stations . For a street selling price of $ 200 I would have expected better . You have to try to mess up digital sound , the iJuke has done just that and it 's clear from the cheap old-school speakers that not even Crosley intended the iJuke to be a music device . My kids love it anyway because it 's fun . I 'm bitter that I have no reason to listen to it . The unit is lightly and cheaply made and I give the remote 6 months of use before it stops working . The second item is , my unit broke within 30 days of new . One of the tubes pulled out of the bubblers in plain sight on the front panel and stopped working . Crosley has not responded to my requests for a return authorization number , neither by phone or by e-mail as the website says will happen . So in my opinion be aware you are shelling out $ 200 for a low quality toy if you buy this item . If you have money to burn , don't expect sound on par with docking stations half the price , or don't expect anything more than infrequent bursts of entertainment for the kids then it 's an OK purchase . ADDITIONAL experience a few months laterWe recieved a replacement unit a few months later , but not through Crosley as they were unresponsive . I managed to get my company awards program vendor to take the old one back and supply a new one because this is a fun item for the kids . The new one failed within just days . We were eating dinner while this was on and there was a sharp CRACK ! and when we went over to look at the unit , one of the bubbler tubes had cracked , no more bubbles and the fluid weeped out . That one was returned as well . Since having this unit I have purchased one of the Logitech Squeezebox radios and the difference in sound is just night and day , Bose would be happy to have sound like the Logitech produces . This Crosley has such bad sound and such poor quality a fitting nickname would be the iJunk .  
2	  Great clear sound using a 5.1 card . Love it in games and movies . The Sub is heavey which is a good size indicating it has a big speaker under its belt .  
2	  needed a economical , multi functional travel plug . lighter weight , great concept , but eurpoean plug need a little more length . compact .  
2	  We were apprehensive at first ordering a TV from Amazon but were delighted with white glove delivery . Tv itself is outstanding picture and color quality , sound is like surround sound we keep looking to the side and behind us to figure out where it is coming from ! Very satisfied w / tv and purchasing from Amazon . com .  
2	  Great camera for all the begginers out there . It does work with xp . You can get 41 of its best quality pics on a 32 mb cf card . I would recemend rechargeable batteries since it takes about four pictures with flash and lcd to kill them . great pictures and comes with good software .  
1	  I got this for the new Macbook Pro ( MBP ) 15 " . I upgraded the screen to Antiglare Widescreen Display . When I put this privacy filter on top of the display , it created many dark lines . This made my eyes tired after working for 10 minutes . I tested this with my old MBP with the standard glossy display , I didn't see the same dark lines . I recommend people who has an Antiglare display to stay away from this product .  
1	  I bought this in a gamble to see if it would be compatible with my new nano 5g . It 's not . I do still have a nano 3g , so I thought I 'd use it with the old one . No big deal , right ? But no , the sound quality is so bad , that I just had to return it . I know that FM transmitters will never have good quality sound , but compared to my old DLO FM transmitter , iTrip is garbage . DLO has a big cradle that 's attached to the cigarette lighter , which is why I wanted an iTrip . But I think I 'll stick with the DLO .  
1	  I have had this drive and am extremely dissatisfied with it . It performs far slower than my old Lexar JumpDrive which is only USB 1.1 . I have read the Cruzer titanium is the fastest on the market . Well , after owning the Cruzer micro I can say it must be the slowest on the market . I have tried every type of file system when I format it . I have tried to optimize for performance . And I have tried to copy files large and small . No matter what I do I cannot speed up this drive . It does get 1 star though for being so small and having a cool blue light when it is plugged in .  
2	  Item as described . Received my shipment super fast . Would do business with again . Can't beat the low ptices . Beats paying $ 25 or more for same item  
1	  I 've been looking a while for the best pair of headphones for the price , and I feel like I found it with these bad boys . The sound quality is fantastic , bass works wonderfully . I must say though the cord length is a problem , but I improvised and tied the cord up to make is smaller . Also you may find them a bit tight at first , but within a few minutes it was fine . Now though , the headphones are acting up . Sound quality is basically gone . I had these since March of 2010 and had no problems until today ( June 9th 2010 ) . This is how I found out . My headphone jack was all the way in my Creative Zen , sound quality was bad , volume was low for how High I had the volume . Well I mess with it a bit , move the cord , sound quality is back to normal , but only for a bit , then I pull the jack out a little bit , that helps , but only until I put the jack back all the way in . I never dropped them or anything , I took the best of care of them , now they 're junk .  
2	  An excellent out of the box camera that provides clear sharp pictures at a very affordable price . The software included wasn't used since I prefer to use San Disk readers rather than the included factory software . Almost impossible to beat the quality to value pricing for this camera with features you 'd see in cameras costing $ 100 or more than the base price of this one . The only drawbacks I found were the delay in the shutter time which makes it very hard to keep steady long enough to allow the camera time for the auto focus mode to kick in . To resolve this I had to get a tripod . The next drawback is the size and shape of the camera . While it can and will easily fit into any size camera bag it is a little difficult to hold even for small hands and the shape of it is a little bulky in the front to back measurements making it awkward without a fixed base as your holding platform . Other than that though , it truly is one incredible camera that will deliver sharp crystal clear pictures in almost any type of setting or light .  
2	  I picked this unit up to replace a Saitek A-100 system that had skyrocketed in price after I fried it due to a power adapter mismatch . Unlike the Saitek , this personal system comes with a power adapter ( no identification on it , so it would be prudent to label the device it 's intended for ) . The sound from its lightweight speakers is at least as " present " and loud as the Saitek unit , though bass frequencies are slightly more muffled . The Cyber Acoustics Portable is not quite as " grip friendly " as the Saitek 's narrow , flatter design , which is also lighter overall in weight when used with batteries , employing 4 AA batteries as compared to the Cyber Acoustics ' 4 AAs . Nevertheless , the Cyber Acoustics Portable can slide into a jacket pocket with little problem other than excess wire ( see below ) . Even though the Cyber Acoustics comes with power adapter , it lacks the fold-out stand that made the Saitek relatively stable when used on a desk top . Especially when not weighted down by the 4 double-A batteries , the Cyber Acoustics is prone to tip over and move around on a flat surface with little provocation . Also , the power adapter pin doesn't seat deeply or securely in the speaker unit , causing it to come loose with moderate movement of the speakers . The cable to the player is permanently attached to the speaker , which could save the frustration of searching for a misplaced mini-cable . The downside is that it 's a good 5 feet , more than you need ( or want ) when transporting the speaker with your iPod on walks around the block or when your player is in close proximity to the speaker . The excess cord requires some clever concealing on the part of the user . Also , I 'm not one to complain about overly bright " power on " lights , but this one , even though blue , is a potential migraine trigger , so best not to gaze at it . Overall , a good little speaker for the money . It 'll serve until Amazon Gold Boxes another Saitek A-100 .  
1	  Shortly after the warranty expired the printer quit working . It showed error message about " paper jam " and there was not a paper jam . I contacted HP on the phone twice and once online . It would not reset and HP would not replace it . There is no fix for this problem . I found customer service at HP to be the worse I have ever dealt with . They would only offer a refurb at a price which was higher than I could buy a new one at most stores . This will be the last HP product for me . I also had a HP CD writer that did not work . I hate HP products ! I replaced the HP printer with a Canon MP530 for half the price of the HP and it works perfectly .  
1	  Superb cam , picture quality is excellent - so is handling . According to several reports in internet unfortunately large quantity seems to be affected with tape transfer noise , the one I bought too . For more info see ww . akuutti . netKind Regards , PKa  
2	  These speakers give truly high definition audio . Being THX certified , its no surprise . The sub-woofer is hyperactive so I keep it at one level above minimum and it blends in perfectly with the sound . The sound card connecters are not very good and at the first shot I ended up getting sound only from 3 speakers and the subwoofer . Then after pressing the connectors in harder they clicked properly into place and the sound was perfect . I 've read some reviews online that state that these speakers emit a hissing sound even when not being used . I was able to get rid of that problem by using lower impedance cables from the sub-woofer to the speakers . Also , using optical connection makes the music sound way better . To give you some idea of the power of the speakers , let me tell you this - I live on the first floor of my building and have a friend who 's on the fourth floor . I was able to wake him up from sleep just by turning the volume to 3/4th the full . He thought there was an earthquake . Now that 's something really amazing .  
2	  This is a great compactflash card . I took a lot of pictures in Europe for about 2 weeks and the card wasn't even half full . Excellent read / write data speed . No issues in the sport mode .  
2	  Love it to death ! Apple did it again as u know and Amazon gives u the best deal . What can I say ? More than words can say . . . Place your order and enjoy your music .  
2	  I love it ! Met my expectations ! Why I have to put so many words here ? I just LOVE it !  
2	  Just got it as a gift and already cant be without it ! I take it too the gym , the office or out running . I am a fanatic for hi-tech stuff but this is really great for anyone .  
2	  I just love my Sony Psyc Boombox . It offers big sound from a very small package . It 's ideal for sitting around the pool , with its handy multi-function remote . All of my neighbors have commented on the design . Some say it looks like a spaceship , I think it looks like a giant ant head . The full , rich sound is enhanced by the mega-bass function and is comparable with other high-end compact systems . With the unit plugged into the wall , this little system will fill a room with hi-fi sound . Running on batteries , however , is a different story . Six ' C ' batteries are required if you have no access to an outlet . If you plan on playing CD 's while running on batteries , expect to listen to only one disc . The CD 's laser , presumably , uses an exponentially larger amount of juice than any other function , radio or cassette . Radio listening will get you the most time from the batteries . If you decide to go rechargeable , get the higher capacity batteries . Overall , I 'm completely satisfied .  
2	  I gave one of these to my daughter when it was clear the Sony videocam I had given her earlier was not seeing any use . Immediately the films of grand-daughter demonstrating her latest ballet moves started arriving via e-mail-good enough to motivate me to get my own Flip , even though ( or especially because ) I 'd never used my Panasonic videocam . Like a Canon Elph , the Flip fits in a pocket , but it 's less complicated and more user-friendly . The image quality , moreover , is quite satisfying if your primary interest is in capturing some of those moments that are otherwise lost . The good : 1 . The convenient the pull-out arm means no missing USB connector when you need it . 2 . Good image and sound when camera is plugged into composite inputs on a TV set ( admittedly lousy audio from the camera itself ) . 3 . The company is so determined to make things easy , the camera comes with batteries installed . Such attention to user-friendliness characterizes everything about this camera and its save and edit program . You can send low-res clips over e-mail , save hi-res clips to your computer , select snap-shots with a simple click and then drag them as Jpegs to iPhoto ( I 'm using a Mac ) . Edit movies in iPhoto or use Flip 's editing program , which is similar to that of Roxio Toast ( permits trimming the beginning and end of a scene ) . 4 . On a Macbook a 30-minute film opened on the desktop in 30 seconds . Saving it to a higher resolution required 2 minutes . 5 . The lens is capable of capturing viewable images even in near-dark conditions . Things to be careful about : 1 . The zoom lens button is so close to the start and stop trigger that it 's quite easy to activate the unintended feature ( compose your shot , then forget the zoom ) . 2 . The lightness of the camera makes it very susceptible to camera shake . ( Keep your shots short and resist the temptation to zoom in and out . ) 3 . There is no viewfinder and the camera 's screen washes out when shooting outside in bright conditions . 4 . The delete button is so accessible that a 2-year-old can lose all your footage with two clicks ( it was poor judgment on my part to let her play with the camera ) . 5 . Very few instructions come with the camera , but they 're not needed . Flip dumbs it down to practically any point and shooter 's level . Which Flip ? There are some demonstrations comparing this Flip with the newer model ( Ultra Flip ) on Youtube . It soon becomes clear that there is no improvement in image quality when using the newer , more expensive model . And since I have little interest in editing and have an accessible laptop , I figured that 30 minutes would be all the time I would require from the camera . If you choose your shots resourcefully , half an hour is enough to capture an entire wedding-from ceremony through reception . Think like Hitchcock-keep the shots short in duration and make them count .  
1	  I bought this DVD / VCR combo so that I could play DVD , VCD etc . multi format as well as PAL tapes from UK . However , I found out now from Philips Tech Support that it does not play some compact DVD as well as VCD . Their website states that it plays it all in region 1 but now I found out it does not . Hence , I have to return it to Philips and find out if it is a problem with the unit or not . I could play these on my neighbors Panasonic DVD . It is a bummer . HB DVD reveiwer  
2	  This was one of the best purchases I could have made along with my new LED monitor . Not having the easy option for two monitors , I knew that I wanted to continue to use my Macbook 13 " as a secondary monitor , mostly for stickies and mail , leaving my main monitor open for Photoshop ( which is what I spend most of my day on ) . I picked this stand mainly due to the aesthetics , but there are numerous other merits to it : - Strong , wobble-less design ( unlike others I have tried ) - Promotes better air flow ( small reduction in temps noticed ) - Elevates Macbook Aluminum 13 " to an excellent height for dual monitor usage - Easy cable management with the hole on the back - Even when not using secondary monitor , this has helped my posture by elevating the laptop screen - Finish is VERY close to the Apple aluminum - Cutout for easy lid openingOverall there is just no comparison ! This is absolutely the best stand for Apple ( and other ) laptops on the market . Due to its stationary nature and lack of moving parts , you can fully expect this product to last you for YEARS . The metal used seems mostly scratch-proof , indeed I have seen little o no wear in the year I have owned it ! I would highly recommend this to both people with an external monitor , and those using the laptop by itself - it will improve your posture and reduce strain on your neck and back ! Highly recommended !  
1	  All I can say is , sometimes it works , sometimes it causes Windows to crash . I have had to reinstall this device as many times as I have used it ..  
2	  I should have bought this years ago . I 've tried " universal " remotes that just don't have the buttons I need to work my relatively simple system . But this remote actually does replace the 4 that I used to have , and controls all of the features I use on my equipment . It feels good in my hand , and the buttons are sized and placed in useful and at least semi-intuitive places . Setup was straightforward . Although , as previous reviewers have noted , the Harmony web site gets a little jammed sometimes , so it can be a little frustrating to set this up if you pick the wrong day or wrong time . A little patience solves that problem . And so far , battery life seems to be pretty good . Perhaps the reviewers who were experiencing poor battery life were using backlighting a lot ; I find that I don't , and that may be why the batteries are doing well . I would recommend this remote to anyone who wants to get rid of remote clutter .  
1	  This unit has great sound and quite a punch . 22 Watt RMS , twin possition BBE processing for nice mids . But the biggest drawback is the quality of the unit itself . First off , the magic flap idea is unique . But the first problem I had is that it wouldn't always flip open for use , but continue to play . Next , All of a sudden all it would do is play the disc , and never even eject . I was stuck listening to the same disc for a couple of days . Then it just quit working all together . When I contacted Aiwa , They informed me that I was just days past the end of my warranty . It would therfore cost me 99.00 to get it fixed . End of story . This unit is either going in the trash , or I am going to send back to the manufacturer so they can shove it where they may . I will never buy another product from this company . And I would advise anyone I know to do the same . If you ask me , they don't deserve anyone 's money .  
2	  I bought the 1600 Microsoft Points , which ended up being $ 1 cheaper than if I bought them from my Xbox 360 . The code showed up immediately , so in no extra time I saved $ 1 . Plus I didn't have to give my credit card information to Microsoft . Well worth the buy , if you are in need of some Microsoft points .  
2	  It meets my needs for a scanner and copier . Copies are clear with good color . The only drawback is it doesn't have a handset to enable it to double as a phone , but it does have caller ID . For an inexpensive all-in-one , it serves my purpose just fine .  
1	  I ordered 6 keychains , all working but none of them connected to computer after applying all setting given on different forums like of " USB Updates " etc . I tried on 4 different computers / Laptops . It shows the image beautifully comes by default , but its of no use if you can not transfer your own data .  
1	  I bought this product from Wal-Mart and I loved how it looked but once I used it for maybe 3 days I hated it . The little sleeves keep falling out and it is just a big mess . I don't reccommend it .  
2	  * Did a lot of research before buying this lens and it is everything I was hoping for . My favorite lenses in the 35mm film range were 24 and 28mm . This lens covers that range with some left on both sides with very little distortion , and the edge to edge sharpness I would expect from a fixed focus . So far I have not noticed any major " purple fringing " problems that others have in high contrast areas . Since I do all my processing in PS , I am prepared to deal with those as they pop up . I manual focus only so did not test the auto focus aspect of the lens . I personally do not mind the size of the lens hood as long as it does the job it was intended to do . Someday I will buy that 15mm LTD , but I like the ability to zoom instead of switching lenses out the the dust , dirt and sand I find myself shooting in many times . Maybe Pentax will come out with a weather sealed version of this great lens ?  
1	  I had the same monitor " dying " experience as some of the other reviewers . Screen suddenly started flashing one day and the whole thing went dead . Returned it for repair and Samsung kept me in limbo state for the last 3 months . The process went from repair->exchange->refund state after hours spent withconfused reps . It seemed that the process is designed to wear the consumerout , with multiple departments passing the buck . Today I was notified that my refund has been canceled without any reason . I have to call back in a few days to find the reason for the cancellation . Will never buy Samsung again . I have already bought my TV from them , and it isa nightmare to think what would happen if it went dead like the monitor . My only recourse is the small claims / consumer court if they cancel my refund .  
2	  OEM Epson inks are the right product for your inkjet Epson printer , as long as you care about things like color fidelity . Of course , that 's equally true if you use a different brand of printer . if you use lasers * and * dont care about color fidelity , you have more options . this seller provided current , legitimate Epson ink at a good price . thanks !  
1	  the product seems like a great idea , however , it did not come with attatchments for an i-pod , which is the reason we bought it . Called the company to get the adapter and now need the mfg part number . it has just been a hassle  
2	  I have used an iPOD in the past and have not really been impressed with the click wheel and menu system . My favorite up until now has really been the Creative ZEN series . I stayed away from the Zune since I heard some bad press when it was released over a year ago . Late summer of 2007 brought a new version of firmware which righted many of the wrongs reported by people using the Zune , kudos to MS . Fast forward until black Friday , 2007 .. Microsoft and several retailers including Amazon were blowing out the brown Zune at under $ 100 to get some good market share for Microsoft .. talk about your loss leader .. I bit the bullet and bought a couple of them , one for my daughter and one for me . Setting up the Zune is very easy , navigating through the menus is simple , the sound is great .. my initial reaction to the Zune was that it is a great audio and video device .. the addition of a Belkin battery extender and Altec Lansing Home speaker dock made it all the better of an experience . The video is crisp and sharp on the 3 " screen ( only 2.5 " screens in most other video players including the iPOD .. yes the iTouch iPod may have a bigger screen , but not a bigger hard drive ! ) So , 30GB of storage , easy interface , wireless connection , FM Radio tuner ( ipod don't have that either ) , pictures , videos , music , podcasts and more .. I am very happy with this product ! ( so is my daughter )  
1	  I have a 4x50 watt radio that blew these speakers almost instantly . I would suggest going a step up or so if your working on a custom audio system for your vehicle . These would probably be fine with a smaller output stereo as well .  
2	  I recently bought the Sony MDR-J10 h . ear Headphones from Amazon and it 's not too bad . I originally owned a pair around a year and a half ago ( the sound in the left head-phone died ) and decided to revisit my old favorite headphones . Pros : - Excellent sound .. you get some really decent bass from these . The tone is solid . For 10 dollars , the sound is really quite good ! - Looks cool ! I owned the blue pair before and I really like the black ones . - Very comfortable .. unlike earbuds , these don't feel like your ear is getting probed . Cons : - Definitely could not use it for running ! These are the kind of headphones I would wear while lounging in a chair or doing something not too active . Maybe my ears are too small , but these don't feel as secure on my ear as I originally expected . In that sense , I like by Philips earbuds which I use to go running . Really for 10 dollars , you are getting a pretty solid deal . Like I mentioned , you get good sound and quality . Fitting is an issue that depends on your ears ;-) .  
1	  The Finepix A310 was a disappointment to say the least . I got an excellent deal on the camera but because of it 's image noise , the camera suited no purpose . I read the reviews regardin the noise , but assumed it was an exaggeration . It was no exaggeration . Do not purchase this camera if you are going to use it to take pictures ( AKA : Don't buy this camera ) The image noise and blurriness in pictures will disappoint you . In my testing I compared the image noise of this camera to that of a Finepix 2650 ( 2MP ) , Nikon 2100 ( 2MP ) , and Canon Powershot A70 ( 3MP ) . In all these cases , the Finepix A310 faired far worse . I have returned my Finepix A310 for a Canon PowerShot A70 . Couldn't be happier .  
2	  I got my HipZip a month ago , and I love it . The reasons : 1 ) First & foremost , the PocketZip disc concept is a quantum leap forward for the MP3 market . I would have been very unlikely to buy any MP3 player if I had to shell out [ $ ] for each new memory card . These guys cost [ $ ] apiece . 2 ) Transfers from computer to player are a breeze ; on my Mac it 's just drag-and-drop , and it takes about 5 seconds per song . 3 ) Despite the fact that it has moving parts , it is completely skip-proof . The number one reason I bought this player is for workouts . I leave it on my hip while I run , and it never misses a beat . I 've tried shaking it hard while it 's loading , and I still can't get it to skip . 4 ) Iomega thought of all the little things : nice case ( you never have to take it out ! ) , belt clip , slick-looking design , one-handed controls , nice display screen , equalizer options , lock switch to prevent accidental button-pushing , rechargable battery , auto-off feature . 5 ) If that 's not enough , it even acts as a little PocketZip drive ! Store word processor or spreadsheet files or anything else you want , even on the same disc with a bunch of songs . Good for transfering files between work & home . 6 ) Sound quality is extremely good ( with good headphones ) . Only complaint is that I wish the discs held a little more . However , I 've found that if you rip your CDs at 96K ( considered " near-CD-quality " , but to my ears , the difference from 128K is very slight ) you can get about 53 minutes of music on a disc - enough for most albums ( especially if you cut out the inevitable couple of bad songs ) . As to size , this is one of the larger player on the market , but hey , it still weighs less than 6 ounces - not a problem even for exercising . It 's still about 30 % smaller than my tape Walkman . In the end , which player you buy should depend on what you 're going to do with it & how you use it . For me , it was vital to be able to change music rapidly ; with the HipZip , I just pull out a new disc every time I go to the gym , and I have fresh tunes ! For most uses , this thing should take over the MP3 market .  
1	  The battery worked very well for about one or two months , and then is was not able to hold a charge at all . It ended up being a waste of money .  
1	  Well , the selling feature of 10x optical zoom had me hooked . Unfortunately , the picture quality was terrible ( not just the zoom pix ) . I had a Kodak for 4 years and it took MUCH better pix . My daughter 's Olympus had great pix of the same events that I took with the Panasonic . I returned it after using it at a weekend basketball tourney ; I purchased a Cannon A710 as a deparation purchase the night before I left for a big trip and was thrilled with the pix quality and features .  
2	  These Ipods are aewsome they have video playback capabillity which is pretty cool . I love the Ipod Buy IT NOW !  
2	  This time at least I also received function along with the style . I love this litte DVD player . It travels great , hooks up easily and tne only problem I had with setup involved an antiquated ( early 90 's ) receiver . The small footprint makes it perfect for a bedroom or kitchen set up with a nice CRT tuner .  
1	  I have 1 GB of RAM and a Pentium processor and Broadband service . Normally my computer is pretty darn fast in all things . It took 41 hours to back up my C : drive . That amounted to 12 GB of data . After the back up my computer practically ceased to run . I unplugged the unit ; no help . I finally had to uninstall all the software for my computer to return to normal . It has been a nightmare . All the info is securely stored but I can't imagine what it would do if I ever actually needed to use it to restore this to my computer . I really wanted to use the sync function but since I can't keep it installed that is not possible .  
2	  the i-pod works very nicely . No problems . The only reason I stopped using it was for a bigger one . I bought an 80gb . Otherwise this one is very nice .  
1	  This cable does not convert VGA to RCA-what it will do is convert your component ( like maybe on a DVD player ) output to a VGA input . I feel like I got ripped off here . I wish I had read the other reviews more carefully .  
1	  The battery would not charge and would not power the Canon 1100IS . It was the battery recommended by Amazon . The camera does work when the Canon battery is inserted . Either the battery was defective , or it was the wrong one for the Canon 1100IS . Either way , I should not have been charged a restocking fee .  
2	  I purchased the first one on sort of a fluke ; loved it , and left it at a vacation home since it 's hot there . Purchased two more ; one as a ' traveler ' with my laptop , and one for home . They work well ; the power input location could be better but would present a considerable engineering and manufacturing challenge to move it . Overall , I highly recommend the product .  
2	  for the price and what you get , you can't beat the price . I think the price of the compatibility products speak for themselves . They seem like a great deal and when the wallet gets tight you for it . I have tried them and although not to bad , in the end when it comes to cleaning up your printer or having it serviced for problems , most of the time it turns out to be the ink . Another issue with the compatibility tanks is the number of failures . All this has done is screw up my print head . Stink with OEM .  
1	  I am having color problems with this monitor ; it has a pinkish haze and the left side of the screen is washed out about an inch . It was OK the first day I had it , but the problems showed up after a day or two of use . Re-calibrating the monitor does help - but does not eliminate - the pinkish haze , and the washed-out part is there no matter what . There are many posts on the Apple Support boards about others with the same problem . You may want to consider this , and hopefully Apple will adknowledge a design flaw in these models soon .  
1	  First of all , this has to go in the top PC slot , because it is bulky . Second , I couldnt get it to work with my notebook ( running ME ) . The lights stayed red . Most importantly , and the reason I didnt pursue trying to get it to work for too long , as a previous review said , the card interfered with my wireless connection . My wireless nic card below the usb adapter couldnt hold a signal , even without the usb card working . So , I returned it , needless to say .  
2	  Although the manual never says it in so many words , it is possible to program this unit to record radio programs to cassette tape . The digital tuner and on-timer round out the capability to perform reliable timed recordings . The earphone jack can directly feed a sound card for capturing from the radio or cassette , but the AM radio picks up a lot of static from the computer if it is in the same room . The oval shape and lack of a handle detract from its portability as a boombox .  
1	  Just purchased these as a birthday gift . Unpacked them and the set looks great . Went to connect the left speaker wire to the left red speaker clips on the subwoofer ; the red tab slips out , and the spring goes inside the subwoofer ! Nice ! These are going back to Best Buy !  
2	  Wowee some people are mighty picky for something that costs $ 4.00 ( or maybe they paid more ? ) I bought it because I like the designs on other flat mousepads but still wanted wrist support . At this price you can't beat it . I haven't had issues with seams coming apart etc . ( Are they using this as a frisbee ? lol ) Comfortable , works just fine .  
2	  It arrived fairly quickly . I took it out of the packaging and plugged it in and it worked perfectly . Great quality and no kinks in the cable or anything . Great product !  
1	  DEFECTIVE ! I can't say if this is a common problem or not , but my point sample of one VX Revolution mouse was pretty dissapointing . Logitech may have over estimated their quality control when they decided to cram " over 420 components " into a little mouse , since the fancy pants scroll wheel didn't really scroll on mine . I had to hold the wheel over to the right to scroll , and the side to side scrolling was ( fortunately ? ) almost imperceptibly slow so i could scroll down with the wheel tilted without it scrolling right . Also , scrolling down went slowly while scrolling up went really fast . Hard to get excited about form factor and features when a basic thing like the wheel doesn't work . It 's going right back to Amazon , and hopefully from there to the QC engineers at Logitech . Sounds like other people have been happy with it though , so I might still get a replacement and see if I have better luck next time . Overall though : if you have to roll the dice on quality , it gets 1 Star . UPDATE : Bought the replacement , and after playing with it for about an hour , i am ready to re-evaluate . Getting a lemon the first time definitely still colors my opinion , but now that I have one that works the way it 's supposed to , i can't help but say , this is one of the smoothest , cleanest , most comfortable mice I 've ever used . I 'd certainly reccomend it , as long as you don't mind the hassle of sending one back if it doesn't work the first time .  
2	  I 've used the Logitech Elite Keyboard LE for more than 5 years now , and it still looks and types like it 's brand new . I 'm very impressed by the longevity of this keyboard and the build quality from Logitech . It 's a standard 103-key keyboard with 4 extra keys above the numpad for parentheses , equals , and backspace so that you don't have to reach across . All of the keys are still very responsive . There are 9 media buttons at the top for web browsing , volume control , calculator , and media playback ; I only used the volume up / down and mute buttons . The key labels must be laser-etched because they haven't worn off a bit after years of typing . The keyboard has been through quite a beating in its time . I 've put it through years of college essays , computer games , drink spills , food crumbs , drops , and bouts of frustration . This thing never missed a beat . Aside from the occasional ghosting issues ( expected from a membrane keyboard ) , it 's never lost a keystroke , and all the actuators still look fine under the hood . You cannot go wrong with the Elite Keyboard LE . A quick $ 20 replacement keyboard that I got from Walmart half a decade ago turned out to be a great investment . I 've moved on to a mechanical keyboard now , but the Logitech is still in my closet , ready to stand in in case something goes wrong . It 's a solid purchase .  
2	  We have used this mouse daily for about 2 years now . It has been dropped , had liquid spilled on it and it just kept going . I am getting ready to purchase another one because the last time that our dog knocked our laptop to the ground the USB plug for the mouse broke . I hope they never stop making this particular mouse because it is the best that I have used .  
2	  I use it to control my media center pc , it works awesome . I would give it 4 1/2 stars , but Amazon doesn't do halves . The instructions weren't to clear on how to charge the keyboard , make sure the switch is off , otherwise nothing happens .  
2	  Bought this card with the MicroMate USB reader and they work well together , are very small so great for travel , and the card seems pretty quick . I 've been buying the ScanDisk Extreme series cards for some time now and they have never failed me yet . No complaints .  
2	  Have had the camera for about a week and find that on auto that it is easy to use but once you go into the menus , there is a steep learning curve that will take forever to learn and it is very frustrating . The image quality to my eye is amazing again on auto but on manuel sometimes it works and other times it refuses to work . The flash is so bright that it washes out things and so I have to go to the low light flash and it is again not readily available but have to push buttons to get there . I am not sure had I really known all of this I would have bought this camera but maybe gone for dslr instead . Check it out carefully before you make this decision .  
1	  Mine didn't work , simple as that , not worth the time or hassle to send it back , just went to radioshack and bought one for 10x the price , but at least it worked .  
2	  If you want a label that is going to last , this is the type to get . You can also get the paper style label tape but the plastic is much more durable and is more resistant to dirt . Also easier to keep clean .  
2	  It is working great , I will give it a 10 , m but it does not comply to the european WIT standarts and Mongolian tt20 specs .  
1	  This is the worst printer I 've ever had . It jams frequently . It does not like to take cardstock from either tray . It takes forever to proces something that has a graphic on it . The print turns out light and hard to read . If tray 2 is not completely full , you get an error message that the tray is empty and the printer won't print until you fill it up . Each time after it prints , it calibrates itself for nearly a minute - when you combine that with all the jamming , it just leads to further delys in printing . Way to expensive for the quality . HP support is less than helpful . If I could give it zero stars , I would .  
2	  This was a gift and my daughter started using it Christmas day ! She actually got two of them and was very happy  
2	  Basicly , what I want from a PDA include organization functions , being compatible with the majority of softwares available and the potential to expend the memory . With a resonable price , handspring Visor Neo gives me all ! With plenty of Palm OS freeware , easy and quick synchronization , my PDA just become more and more valuable ! And boy , they have the best customer support team in the world !  
1	  I am very disappointed in this product as a consumer , and engineer . The two pictures that I posted say it all . First , the LCD display is very dim and almost seems to be out of focus . This makes it difficult to read the information . We can make watches with small LCD displays ; why does the LCD display on this charger have a problem ? Second , the charger worked good for two days and them it self-destructed and in the process it destroyed 8 batteries . Six of these Eneloop batteries were purchased from Amazon about a year ago . The charger got so hot that the plastic melted and the feet stuck to the table . This disaster happened while I was sleeping . There should have been some kind of thermal circuitry to protect the charger , and batteries , from excessive heat . This scares me because there could have been a fire or explosion . This should never have happened ! I have returned the charger to Amazon and I have included the batteries . I have always appreciate Amazon 's return policy but in this case , I am out money . I just purchased new Eneloop batteries with the supplied charger from Sanyo . I will give this charger a try and will hopefully have better luck .  
2	  This power supply has plenty on connections . I was able to get ride on some of my Y-Adapters from my older power supply . The fans are quiet . It seems to be made well . I Would buy another one in a heart beat .  
1	  This 7 in 1 camera with it 's really great design and advertised features , quality and performance I am yet to see out of this product . I tried fooling myself into accepting the quality . Everyone who has seen it loves it and I 'm sure there are some of you that could live with and love it . My experience with it is as follows . The video recording is no better than an average digital still camera with video capability . The mic isn't bad on the audio recording . The still pictures are only slightly better than a cheap net cam . The flash is totally out of range or control , say 5 to 6 feet no closer or farther . The mp3 player is terrible . The voice record function is the only acceptable function . Far from a 4.1 megapixel advertised quality . MPEG-4 format out of this camera sucks . Overall , this is a decent quality camera for a kid to goof with and a waste of 100 bucks in my book . Put it towards a decent mini DV camera .  
2	  Wow ! Got this camera just before my Hawaii vacation . Although I still haven't finished all the instruction , I did learn enough to take fantastic pictures in all kinds of different lighting . Time exposures at night were superb . High resolution results with the SLR camera cannot compare to digital instamatics with those tiny lens aperatures . Recommend this for any enthusiast who lkie to control their on settings .  
2	  We use this to provide wi-fi in our home to our PC laptop , two iPhones , and our iPad and to network everything back to our PC desktop . Works great . For the price you can't go wrong .  
2	  I am very happy with this case . It is just what I wanted , and is durable , lightweight , and protects my ipod very well at the same time . I would recommend it to anyone who wants a case to protect their iPod investment but does not want a big , bulky , leather case to do so .  
2	  Bought this item for less than $ 80 including shipping and handling . Great item so far for its function and price .  
2	  I like : - Quality of sound - Features - USB port - AuxiliaryI do not like : - Access to the parameters of setup is confusing .  
1	  I have no idea how it might work . I can't get it to work , and my time has value . Printed documentation is a single page for a different model . The CD has info for several models , none of which are the one I bought , and the online stuff is a joke . ( How effing difficult or expensive would it have been to add instructions to the CD - or put them online for that matter . ) Unless you enjoy wasting you time puzzling out how to install / use things , buy another company 's product ( s ) . This one is going back for a refund .  
2	  I actually bought this to use outside on our uncovered patio in California . It doesn't rain here often , but I thought it would be good to have something waterproof . We like it very much .  
1	  I ordered the Epson ink cartridge and it does not register in my Epson Stylus Photo 1400 printer ! I ordered 3 different color ink cartridges and this is the only one that does not work . Unfortunately I can not print without 1 cartridge and I have a deadline to meet for a client . The price may be a little more inexpensive that purchasing it in the store , but this has not been convenient for me at all . Now I have to try to hunt a local store down that may have this ink in stock . Epson 79 Light Magenta Claria Hi-Definition Ink Cartridge for Stylus Photo 1400  
2	  I bought this to link my cable router to my bluray player for streaming video . Works great , seems to be a high quality cable .  
2	  This is a very good camera for the money . Great image , very easy set-up , very compatible with all online messenger services . Logitech just needs to work a little more on the white balance , and this cam would be the best .  
2	  Great product for keeping track of the information you need to improveyour golf game . nails down areas you would not even think about .  
1	  I 've been using this mouse for about a month now , and I 've discovered one serious flaw and two smaller but nonetheless irritating problems . First , the showstopper : it doesn't always work . There are few things more frustrating than helplessly sliding a mouse around your desk while your cursor remains stubbornly motionless on the screen , and that 's exactly the experience that I get pretty frequently with the Logitech LX7 . I 've tried it on wood , plastic , fabric mousepads , hard mousepads , and even a small square of stainless steel , and it just doesn't work very well . Right now I 'm using it on a green manilla folder , which seems to work better than anything else , though still not well . Smaller irritation : it comes with an adapter for a PS / 2 plug , so that you don't have to use a precious USB port . The adapter doesn't work , so you 'll be plugging it into a USB port anyway . Very small irritation : the color as represented in the photo is misleading , to put it politely . While the color description " dark blue " is technically correct , a more accurate description might be " so dark a blue that it looks grey or black unless you hold it directly under a bright light " . I 'm a pretty big fan of Logitech products in general , but this particular one is a lemon .  
2	  This monitor is simply excellent . We bought two for our small company , and plan to buy more . It enhances everything you do , and is great for graphic design , schematic capture , board layout , etc . Our two monitors do not have the power button issue that the other user mentioned . Perhaps he is confused by the fact that it 's a capacitance push-button . You don't press it , you simply place your finger over it . Be sure that your graphics card can support this monitor at native resolution . The card needs to have enough umph , and a DVI-D dual link connector .  
2	  I took the leap and bought this hub , even after reading an unfavorable review here at Amazon . The hub is a bit odd because it does not have its own power source . After researching all over the net , I realized this was actually good design , not a defect . It 's actually very nice to have one less power cord hanging from the desk top . I have a pair of speakers , a wireless keyboard , a digital camera , and a USB pen drive plugged into the hub now for over a month without any problems . I also have a firewire iPod plugged in . I have had no power issues . My guess is that the combination of power from the firewire and USB cords that plug into your Mac Mini work together to send power where its needed . I tested the hub with a " Kill-A-Watt " meter and found that it only raised the power consumption of the Mac Mini by about 3 watts while in standby mode . The one annoyance I will report is going to be with the USB standard in general . It appears that some USB devices have a " slightly " shorther plug than others . This difference is in millimeters , but it was an issue with my " Lexar USB pen drive . " The pen drive will not plug into this hub and power on every time . This is because the Belkin hub has a very thin skin of plastic between the USB ports and the device plug . I 've read other reviews with other hubs where this is an issue . You should take a couple of your USB device cables and hold them next to each other to see an length difference . If you find any plugs that are slightly smaller then the rest , it may not work with this hub . This issue is annoying , but easily fixed . I just plugged the pen drive into an USB extension cable , and then plugged the cable into the hub . I don't fault Belkin on this issue . I fault Lexar for not making the plug long enough . All the rest of my devices fit fine . This issue of the USB plug length may be confused with other power issues in reviews for this hub . I believe that the hub provides plenty of power for it 's devices . I just think some older devices may not have a long enough plug to fit those last couple of millimeters into the socket .  
2	  I bought this case , which fits the Sony RX100 perfectly , and another Sony case at the same time . Sony LCSCSW / L DSC Carrying Case - Blue . The other case didn't fit the RX100 and it just didn't feel as nice . This one is higher quality and just feels nicer .  
1	  Purchased icap recently , great concept , poor quality execution . The caps were so thin and flimsy , they wouldn't stay on the iphone earbuds . They won't stay in your ears , either . Don't waste your money .  
2	  Arrived pronto ! I rate this item and the service thereto as superissimo ! I rate this item and the service thereto as superissimo !  
2	  The 4 feet cord is too short . But the price is cheaper than that I saw in CVS . No need to complain  
2	  This is the best tiny radio I know of . I 've tried others that are built into headphones ( too heavy ! ) or strap onto the wrist ( sound & reception less good ) or that sell for cheap at the drugstore ( awful reception ) . From the suburbs it pulls in the NPR station just fine ( some small radios don't ) . I like that the tuner is analog , not digital . In my experience , the cheap digital tuners in other small radios cut in and out annoyingly on marginal stations . Sounds great with better headphones ( I use Grado SR80 ) . I lent it to my girlfriend and she kept saying , " It 's so cute ! "  
2	  Just purchased a second one for my summer house this time rev . B which is ipv6 ready . the Rev. B seems better then rev . A because it has more features you can enable and it seems to work well . Always remember no matter what revision you have always update to the latest firmware so if you have any problems the update should fix it . But any hows so far no complaints works 100 % fine would defiantly buy another new one if needed . Updated 6/15/12 : This router still works great the range has degraded a bit through the wireless connection but for me if my other AP misbehaves then i turn to this guy for a strong , reliable connection . This router has not let me down yet and I feel happy with this purchase . As with any router ALWAYS , always , always upgrade your firmware because if you are experiencing problems and are not updated then there you go ! Note * : You may encounter some units in the wild that are bad , this is normal as not all technology is perfect and there can be faults but the majority of these routers are fine if you know your technology .  
1	  You get less than what you pay for with this cable . I knew when I bought it not to expect something of high quality , but I 've had it for less than a month and it 's already stopped working . There were immediate problems with the audio , but they were ignorable . However , after owning and using the cable for only 3 weeks , I plug it in to my computer and the visual component was out , too . All I got was a green screen on my television . This product is crap . Don't waste your time with it .  
2	  Works well to hold documents without taking a lot of desk space . And you can not beat this price . Great buy .  
2	  My intent here is to give a glowing review of this Harmony 670 remote ; although , there are a couple of negatives as well . I am using this Logitech remote as my principal device controller for my 32 " LCD HDTV , my Comcast HD DVR cable box , and my DVD player . This is not a ' Home Theater ' set-up , but for routine TV-watching in the living room . This 670 is a well-constructed remote , and it feels substantial in my hand ( with batteries for ballast ) . The remote immediately worked everything after I programmed it online , which was impressive to me . I like the fact that the remote requires online programming , because that means its software is upgradable indefinitely . And for over $ 100 , I want this thing to operate my future gadgets , too . It is my understanding that this can operate other IR devices as well , such as lights . The little toggle controller ( cursor joystick ) is small for my thumb .. I prefer the size of the TiVo cursor buttons . Since I have a DVR that runs all my TV viewing , it took additional reprogramming to customize a few buttons . Also , there is a small glitch I still need to resolve ( two screens activate on the same button ) . All in all , this is a fine choice for the ' techie ' user who enjoys having a PC link-up for fine-tuning . I 've tried countless so-called ' Universal ' remotes over the years and I 've been bitterly disappointed . This is the first remote that lives up to the hype !  
1	  First off I bought 2 rolls of this " 50 Foot " speaker wire because of the low price . This speaker wire is not 50 feet as advertised . It is only 45 feet . I pulled out my tape measure which goes to 50 feet and I held one end of the wire while my niece held the other end and put against the tape measure and it is only 45 feet . This company cheated me 5 feet per roll . 2 Rolls = 10 feet of wire that they owe me . Do yourself a favor and buy another brand of speaker wire . This company will cheat you . I will never buy anything from this company again and neither should you .  
1	  If you wipe any kind of liquid on this sticker , it vanishes . Save your money and get something else .  
2	  This was a replacement battery for my Casio digital camera . My first one ( which I got with the camera ) wouldn't hold a charge anymore but this was after 3 years of fairly heavy use . I prefer to get batteries which carry the name of the equipment rather than getting a cheaper " comparable to " or " compatible with " battery . I 'm sure they 're probably the same thing but I have less confidence in knock-off brand batteries . Although I feel it 's worth the added expense , if it were about $ 10 cheaper that 'd make me happier and would warrant a 5-star rating from me .  
1	  Do not buy this product . After two weeks , the clip that held the headset in place when unfolded , broke . It 's not something that can be repaired .  
1	  It rewinded the first tape ok , except the START button wouldn't stay down . I had to keep the button down with my finger . But on the second tape STOP button got stuck and somehow it eat the tape . I got it from radio shack , it 's going back there tomorrow .  
1	  I got this unit about two months ago . As other users have indicated with their units , my scanner has begun making a shrieking sound which is quite unbearable . The unit never scanned very well , and now it barely scans at all . This HP product is very attractive and well priced , but what does that mean if a piece of hardware is poor ? It took me a while to figure out that the scanner was making the shrieking sound . I thought my computer was dying . I 've had many scanners and never encountered anything like this before . Reading reviews here and elsewere has actually confirmed my suspicions that this is some type of design defect . I used an Agfa SnapScan 1212u for almost 8 years without a problem . I " upgraded " because I wanted a faster ( USB-2 as opposed to USB-1 ) scanner , and a unit that had slide and film transfer capabilites . This scanner was never much faster than my Agfa and the quality is on much , much lower . Terrible . I would advise anyone reading this to buy another product .  
1	  I bought this model since it has a fat rebate which brings down the price to $ 10 . Good for the price . And the stability is not too far above the price level . Installation is relatively easy . Hooking the router up with my DSL modem and computer is trivial . Running the software on the CD is easy too . One thing though : since I use static ip for Internet connection , the quick setup does not support it so initially my Internet connection is not up . That 's fine and I know it since many such routers only support dynamic ip address on the Internet side by default . I manually configured that through its web interface and then its wireless and ethernet connections start working . Good so far . And I expect most people would be happy now . But since the default wireless mode does not use security at all which means someone could peek at what you visit or use my Internet connection , so I decided to add security to the router . Now the fun begins . It took me half an hour to figure our which security mode is useable - I finally chose WPA-RSK mode since this is the only security mode I found working ( after numerous reboots ) . But the story does not end here . It keeps dropping connection every 3-5 minutes . Yes , every 3-5 minutes ! This is virtually unuseable . I have to turn off the security feature and this works fine for only 20 minutes . The connection remains on and off periodically . My laptop is only two feet away from the router , so signal strength should never be an issue for me . I don't use any other features of the router , so no comments on other parts . For the price and basic functionality , I gave it 2 star . I wish Belkin had more reliable product , but it certainly disappoints me .  
1	  " The Secret History " was one of the best novels I have ever read . And I was not disappointed when I started reading " The Little Friend " . The disappointment came crashing down upon me when I finsihed reading it . Reminded me a lot of another favorite , " To Kill a Mockingbird " . To my delight Tartt was one of those rare authors who writes a stunning debut novel and , unlike Harper lee , follows it up with an even better second novel .. or so I though until I got to the end . Call me old-fashioned and picky but I hate it when a story simply comes to a screeching halt without a satisfying wrapping up of all the various threads of the story , as if the author got tired or ran out of paper or ink or something .  
2	  This case fits my Seagate GoFlex perfectly . It provides great protection for your portable drives . The only thing I would add to the case would be a wrist strap . The color is nice too .  
1	  If you 're like me , you probably bought this player for one reason only - its DVI output . So let 's talk about that first . The good news - DVI output probably does improve picture quality if you 're outputting in native resolution to a ' digital ' type display unit - ie , a plasma screen , or a projector if it used DLP / LCD technology . But if you 're outputting to an analog device ( ie rear projection or normal tv ) then the improvement is much less noticeable . I have a brand new Philips 60 " rear proj tv and don't really see much difference in the DVI feed at all . So if that is the ' good news ' , what about the bad news ? Lots , I 'm afraid . The biggest problem is that the remote has buttons that do double duty as both fast forward and also as skip to next track , in a manner that is very clumsy and hard to get right . For all intents and purposes , fast forwarding is impossible with this unit . Skipping to the next track is reasonably easy , but if you want to just fast forward a little bit , forget about it . That is a major negative . The remote also seems to have very limited range , and much of the time I 'm having to press buttons repeatedly to get the set to ' hear ' the remote . Nasty . There are other minor negatives as well - for example , there 's no way you can get a display of total time on the disc or remaining time to go , but these are minor points . In summary , this unit is woefully underfeatured and very user unfriendly . I 'm returning mine . Unless you have a plasma screen or LCD / DLP projector , you won't notice much difference in quality with the DVI output . Although I haven't tried one , it seems that probably the Bravo D1 is a better choice if you must have DVI now .  
1	  HP ScanJet 5590 Digital FlatBed ScannerQuality-wise , this scanner is fine for my needs ; I am scanning old photos for archiving and the software that comes with it is easy-to-use and I was impressed with how easy it was to fix up photos , albeit I was looking for something quick . That being said , I would not recommend this scanner for the following reasons : 1 ) It locks up in the middle of scanning , so you have to periodically save your images . This seems random and on two occasions I 've had to re-scan a number of photos . The scanner just gets stuck and stops responding until I do a cold re-start , which means pulling the plug . 2 ) The ADF is useless . I couldn't get it to take anything in without jamming , if it even took the paper in . It 's the reason I got the scanner and a big reason why I am returning it .. 3 ) The price is ridiculous for this thing ; it 's bulky and the ADF is useless . I don't really see how it 's any better than a cheaper scanner , as the the price is inflated by the useless ADF scanner . Don't waste your money with this piece of garbage ; I 'm taking it back .  
2	  This is the second one of these that I 've bought . I looked at about a dozen other types , but keep coming back to this one . It 's functional without being overburdened with features .  
1	  Keys started failing after about 2 months , and some of the key markings rubbed off too . Not recommended .  
1	  This unit looked cool in the store and the display sound was promising . Two months later , there was a whirring sound in the fan in the back of the machine . Despite efforts to clean it out ( thinking it was dust ) it still whirs and is loud and distracting . Don't be fooled by the good looks .  
1	  You would think that for a $ 400 plus item that Panasonic would be able to afford a tape , but of course not . And then to compound matters , there is no mention ( that I can find ) of what tape should be used in the instructions . Of course I only went throught the first 74 pages , it might have been on the last of the seventy five page " manual " Have to go back to Amazon site and do some digging to get the answer . ( Panasonic DVM 60 EJ ) Would it have brought Panasonic crashing down if they had provided a bit more ? Even had they said " Tape xx is not included " that would have helped  
2	  Product delivered exactly the results I hoped for . It took only seconds to clean the sensor on my Pentax K-x and the results seem perfect . Great product , great price .  
2	  I 've been using this product for over one year now and find it to be fantastic . I 've had only minor issues installing , works fine on win XP . After developing wrist strain using a traditional mouse which forces you to position your wrist to hold the mouse , I 've had great improvements while using the touchpad . It didn't take very long to get used to the action , a light touch is all it takes . Scrolling is great - just move your finger along the edge of the pad . Clicks can be performed right on the pad , or using the buttons . It allows you to position your wrist any way you 'd like and use a light touch from any finger desired to guide the pointer . Can't say enough good , will never go back to a mouse .  
2	  I ordered the Canon Wireless Remote Control RC1 for Digital Rebel on a Saturday and was using it on Thursday afternoon . The unit works flawlessly . DBROTH is an outstanding source to purchase electronics from .  
1	  I got this player 2 months ago . It worked fine , it takes some time to get used to using it , but once I did , it was great . HOWEVER , I was using it while walking to class , and the screen just shattered . I did nothing out of the ordinary , it just shattered . The glass is all gone and the screen itself is half-black from it . I e-mailed them AND called them , and I was told from both places that the screen is not covered under warranty ( seems as if almost nothing truly is ) . I even asked them if I could pay to have it repaired , and they said no , tough luck . Anyway , I 'm pretty pissed off right now . I wasted 200 bucks on a decent player , but the warranty makes it not worth [ .. ] . As much as I truly hate to say it , I may buy an ipod next .. atleast they know how to keep a happy customer . I will never buy another iRiver product EVER again .  
2	  Produces excellent photos if you want a quick way to print them without using a PC Although you can also connect to the PC . And being portable makes it fun to have at a party . Does everything the PC can do .  
1	  Nice looking product , but I could not get it to bring in any signal , this may be in part to my location . Personel dept needs some aditude ajusting , my refund was handled through a third party . Confusing , won't order from that place again .  
2	  Cheap Lightweight Headphones That Sound Great . I order a pair for work and another for use on my Xoom tablet computer . Much easier to use the tablet ( for games , music etc . ) in a noisly location when you have headphones . Small easy to store in tablet case .  
1	  After using it for quite some time , I decided that I wouldn't buy this CD player for $ 5 ! For your average music listener who can't tell the difference between good or bad sound , this is perfectly fine . For those who can , the sound is decent . Passable , but not great . I also found it a little flat . ( Not as in intonation . ) The button to open the CD player is pretty aggravating . You really have to push it down . Because of the odd angle at which the button is placed , you 'll have to put another finger on the CD player or else it 'll skid across the table . Because this has no skip protection , it 's really inconvenient . You have to glide across the floor to prevent it from skipping . Even a little nudge can cause it to skip . I 'd suggest doing some research and spending your money on something better .  
2	  this is great seller with good product and prompt shipping and will order from them again . headphones used for my laptop for noise blockage while listening to voices while watching video or movies . good headphones . most small headphines cannot get good connection at jack . this one works great .  
1	  It 's never worked right , paper won't load correctly , this is just more " cheap " junk from HP . Do they make anything worth buying ? Canon and Panasonic seem to be the best buys in most consumer electronics these days .. My review is a bit late .. so no help to all you people that bought one ! I am going throw this one out the 2nd floor window , onto concrete below .. may film it and send it to HP .  
1	  I use it with a vaio laptop . The cursor jumps around all over . Very hard to use sometimes . I am typing and I tend to look at my hands and I find when I look up , the cursor has jumped to some other location and I am not at the end of the document . Then I have to move the text . Bad !  
2	  I bought this TV off of Amazon in the summer of 2004 . Hands down , this has been the single best electronics purchase I have ever made . I was looking for a small TV to bring to college with me . Living in a tiny dorm room , I knew space would be limited . The Toshiba 14 " television was the exact size I was looking for . Without actually seeing it in person , I ordered it off of Amazon as the price was right . Eight and a half years later , this TV is still going strong . I have moved it back and forth between college and home many times , and it 's also traveled with me through three apartments . The picture has remained crisp , the sound is excellent , and overall , the TV has worked perfectly the entire time . I 'd recommend this TV as a bedroom or dorm room unit . It 's perfect for small rooms or for anyone who doesn't need a large screen . It 's incredibly durable , as it 's lasted 8 + years with no damage or negative impact on picture and sound quality . Overall , this is a great TV !  
2	  I needed something to help me control a TV and Linksys Media Center extender in my office . We watch from two places , at my desk and on the treadmill . We have line of sight issues with the IR remotes for both devices from both positions , and I finally got frustrated enough to do something about it . I was going to break down and get another $ 150 ( refurbished ) Harmony 890 RF remote , I 've got two of them and like them a lot , but it was overkill for this situation and I really didn't want to spend that much . I came across this device and thought it was worth a shot . My installation was not without challenges . I charged the battery for a day as recommended , then put it into the remote for the Linksys Media Center extender DMA-2100 which also controls my TV . I could not get the devices to respond and the lights were blinking weird on the " ufo " receiver . I tried it with my XBox remote and it worked properly there so it seemed to be an incompatibility with my remote . I tried their website for some troubleshooting tips and they have absolutely no support online , not even contact info . Frustrated , I emailed their sales department and was told to call in . So I called their main number and the guy who answered the phone was extremely helpful . He hadn't seen that behavior before , but is going to buy one of the remotes to test with . I can't imagine the pile of remotes he must have . So they seem to be a very small company , but extremely helpful and friendly so I will forgive the lack of web content . In the meantime , I 'm not sure if I will be able to get it to work with my remote or not , but I found a Microsoft Media Center remote lying around that I was able to get to work with everything . I also found a 2 headed IR emitter lying around that works with it ( it only comes with a single headed emitter ) . Everything works great . Saved me > $ 100 over buying the Harmony 890 and gets the job done nicely . Very happy with my purchase .  
2	  I 've owned a Harmony 680 remote for over 5 years . It has been failing for the last 2 years , but was more or less usable until recently . The 670 is good replacement - not exactly the same though . The feel of the buttons is different , less rubbery and harder . Some of the buttons are in different places too , but you can always remap them to whatever you like . Comparing the 670 to the One and 700 , there seems to be no reason at all to spend an extra $ 100 for the ridiculous touch screen or color display . I control 5 devices with this remote , and I only use the display buttons in very rare situations , i.e. to adjust settings on my cable box or change surround sound mode .  
2	  I bought this and did not know what to expect . I paid 10.99 for it and I feel I got a freat deal ! I love it easy to use . No need for al the extra brushes its all in one place .  
1	  I thought it came with the cradle ( which is what i really wanted ) , but it doesn't . I must not have read carefully .  
2	  This is one of the best VCRs I have ever seen . I am not talking about special features or bells & whistles . Simply put , this machine records and plays the best picture I have ever seen . I bought one of these last weekend for a spare room . First I tested it out on my main TV set . I made recordings and played them back and also played back pre-recorded tapes . I could not believe the picture reproduction . The greens , reds and blues were perfectly balanced and matched . Color alignment was perfect . This is the best resolution I have ever seen from a Standard VHS recording .  
1	  This was much better than the last non Tivo DTV DVR I tried . I tried the last one for 2 months before I had my TIVO repaired . I recorded last years Superbowl on DT HDDVR and on my old 2002 DTV Tivo HDVR2 . I watched the game on the SD HDVR2 Tivo because the HD picture was not enough better to make up for the inferior slow motion , stop action . It was just too sluggish . I then Tried U-vers with their DVR that can record 4 shows at once on DSL and you can go from TV to TV watching what ever you want from the same DVR . Pick up a show in an other room where you left off . That part was great but almost everything else was inferior . Took me 2 months to get my wife to use it enough so I felt that we had tried . I liked the program package very well but we kept TIVO and suspended the DTV HD DVR which I still have . I upgraded the disk to 1.5 TB Before I gave up on the HD DVR . Each of my 3 DTV TIVOs have 1 TB hard drives I installed . We are still watching some of the 2400 programs we recorded when DTV was active . I suspended my DTV account 2 weeks after I purchased 2 TIVO units and switched to Comcast . I still have a Comcast DVR that I had to take to get the package price . It will do video on demand from Comcast but I do not think we have seen anything from it in the last 3 months . The TIVOs are just so much better . It is very hard to convince people about what they are missing . Even a lot of Tivo users do not know what they are not using . Back in the day all cars had to be hand cranked and that was OK .. It was better than keeping a team of horses so you could hook them up to a buggy to go some place . Hay burners are a lot of work per mile . If someone purchased a new car that had electric start , heater , defroster and electric light but did not know they had them . They would still hand crank the car , bring a blanket , wipe the condensation from the windows so they could see and make sure they got back before dark . They would still think all was fine and that was all they needed but as soon as they found out the car had a starter that worked , a heater that would keep them warm , a defroster that would defog the windows and lights so they could see at night do you think they would be just as happy in a car that did not have these " luxurious options " ? At the point is electric start really an option ? Would you be happy with a hand crank car if the cable co gave it to you and said that it was fine , everyone else is happy with it ? You can try a TIVO for 30 days and then return it . Do not try it for 31 . I like DTV a lot but the DVR is my deterring factor . If DTV had delivered on the long promises Tivo I would not be at Comcast . IMHO the biggest difference in video service in not the lineup , it is the DVR and the extras that Tivo has are not options anymore . You can have a bunch of junk channels and a good DVR and have lots of good programs to watch . When my wife set up her Tivo in 2002 she put Clint Eastwood in her wish list as an actor she wanted to watch . Within seconds Tivo was asking her which 1 of the 3 overlapping movies to skip . All of which were from channels we never looked at or checked the listing because the programming was not worth the effort on those " junk channels " . It took about 3 days to fill the Tivo up with Clint . I watched Oprah on my Tivo and went on vacation for 2 weeks . When I came back my Tivo was full off every talk show it could find . It only had one data point , it knew I liked talk shows . Tivo 's job is to be full of my favorite programming and to find it for me where ever it cam . I would give up HD , Cable , DW02 , and DTV rather than TIVO . I could still put up and antenna , and watch what ever I can get of the internet with my TIVO . The difference between DVRs is still more than the difference between SD and HD . DTV seems to make a point of spending money to put up satellites and better dishes to get more HD . If they worked half that hard with Tivo they would be better off . nuff said .  
2	  No more ear aches ! These ear buds are comfortable to wear for long periods of time . And they come with different size fittings for a perfect seal in the ear .  
1	  Despite the headline , none of the cradle adapters fit the iPod Touch and I don't trust my iPod to be supported by the connector alone . And once the cradle is connected , there is no way to plug in headphones or speakers . All around , a waste of money .  
1	  I purchased a four year warranty from this company on a Sony DVD Camcorder purchased through Amazon . com in 2006 . Earlier this year ( 2010 ) I had problems with the camcorder and returned it to a Sony certified repair center and paid out of pocket for the service - a $ 200 flat fee . Quite simply , I had forgotten I purchased the warranty from this " Produce Coverage " almost four years ago . I received the camcorder back but still had the same issue and once again returned to the Sony Repair center in Texas ( this time within their 90 day return period ) . While this was happening I looked in my records only to discover the original warranty from 2006 . I called Product Coverage and explained that the repairs for the camcorder occurred withing the 4-yr warranty I purchased from them and forwarded receipts . etc . They in turn acknowledged that the repairs did in fact occur within the allotted 4-yr period as paid for but that I had missed submitting my claim by a few weeks ; as the four year warranty had just expired . In short , yes , the problem occurred within the time period of the additional warranty I purchased but too bad for me that I didn't submit my valid claim within the 30 days after the warranty expired . They were not willing to even discuss a partial reimbursement when I asked for a compromise . I guess they feel they are entitled to my $ 149.00 without any accountability ! Please don't give them any more money to continue their unethical businesses practices !  
2	  I purchased this after researching on the Internet for two months . This little gem has many very useful characteristics that most players of it 's range of price don't even come close . I even compared to the latest Sony players and they lack many of the features of the D2 . Sincerely , I highly recommend it .  
2	  I replaced a Sony digital shower radio that became inoperable due to water damage with the Sangean . The Sangean is more expensive but definitely worth the difference in price and more . It is more water proof and has better sound .  
2	  i have to admit these cables give a very clear picture . they are however very pricey . less expensive cable may do the trick but i guess i paid for peice of mind knowing i have the best i can buy .  
2	  I own 2 of the Nikon EN-EL1 batteries and have taken a total of over 6,000 photos with my Nikon 4300 in the past 3 years . About half of the photos are with flash . For my typical use , I get about 50 photos per battery . For vacation photos , I am using one battery , while charging the other . After about 3,000 photos / battery and 3 years , I have not noticed any degradation in the battery life . Good value for the money .  
2	  I had a lot of connection flakiness when I first got mine . And I also had a lot of trouble with the finite number of ports you can open on the firewall . However , I checked out the Linksys website and noticed a firware upgrade . Since then its been great . Seems to move faster to . The biggest additions were enbling the forwarding of a range of port numbers instead of just individual ones , as well as remote administration access . Beware Mac users , though . Linksys offers no tech support for Macs . Fortunately I had Virtual PC and work in an office where I can borrow a laptop . I couldn't get the firmware upgrade to work interfacing from my Mac through the web management interface . But since the upgrade , like I said , it has been fantastic and worth the investment .  
2	  Why sell a white TV with a black power cable ! ? ! Ugh . Also , takes a really long time to turn on and the remote is weird and large ( I replaced with a universal ) . Good picture , size and style , bad attention to details .  
2	  So far so good . The battery charge holds up very well when making video recordings and playback .  
1	  I received this item in a state of disrepair . It does not work . Thank you .  
2	  I purchased these binoculars for use on a 30 foot fishing boat . They work great . The image is clear and when I activate the stabilization , I can read caution and slow notice signs from a long way off . I know that some reviewers have concerns about them not being waterproof . As long as you don't drop them in the water , they seem fine .  
1	  I have had lots of problems with this card , and I have still not gotten it to work . I have an IBM Thinkpad , a Sony Vaio , and a Powerbook G4 . This card doesnt work in * any * of them . I have followed the instructions very carefully . An important note here : The Windows 95 instructions are downright * wrong * and make no allowances for differences in system configuration ( for example insisting that the CD-ROM be D: , as opposed to E :) . There is _ no _ installer on the CD , and Windows wasn't able to find any drivers on the disk . Linux is another story . The card does not seem to power up correctly , so the Linux kernel module cant seem to talk to it . This is probably due to the poor fit of the card in all three of my laptops . I 'll get into that in a moment . In MacOS , the card powered up ( the Powerbook has a very slick PCMCIA dock , so that doesnt surprise me at all ) . However , there are a ) no drivers and b ) it doesnt even attempt to identify itself as 99 % of the other PCMCIA cards out there do . In general , this card has been bad news , and I 'm not sure what to make of it , other than chalking it up to $ 100 down the drain . A further issue , which really prevents me from ever wanting to buy Linksys hardware in the future , is that the card just doesnt " fit " right into the VAIO or the Thinkpad ( both very mainstream , expensive laptops ) . It is necessary to push the card in so hard it feels like the antenna may break off . This is a horrible way to manufacture a product . Lastly , and mostly least , is the fact that the card comes with no case whatsoever . Because it has this huge antenna sticking out the side , it could be easily broken by leaving it in the laptop when moving the laptop around ( which you do with every other card , right ? ) . Your only choice is to continue to use the static baggie that comes with it or improvise something . Overall , the implementation and conception of this product is poor at best , and I will never buy another Linksys product again . Its a miss in three different operating systems on three different laptops .  
1	  Does not work - no real software - a waste of your time . Good only for target practice . I wish we could give negative stars for a piece of dreck like this .  
1	  This is the worst possible music player I have ever used . I bought one for my niece for Christmas last year . It has been sent back to the company 5 times for repairs . It either locks up and will not shut down or you can't reformat it . If you are lucky enough to get it reformatted , after listening for about 30 minutes it does the same thing . This last time it quit working , it locked up ; the screen went completely black and it would not work at all . I didn't even bother calling the company again . I will never buy one again .  
1	  The Uprint Thermal Printer would be absolutly wonderful if it printed properly in the top area all of the time ; about 25 % of the time the first letter of the title or the numbers to songs don't print right or at all . The other areas ( sides and bottom ) seem to be alright .  
2	  WOW . I got to say that this radio is amazing . I was looking for a usb radio that would be very good quality and i just happened to go into best buy to look at the radio 's cause the one in my fiance 's car went bad to find this radio for only 59 bucks . Yes just 59 bucks . I panicked and called over a worker to get one of these in my hands . This thing is truly amazing . No more burning cd 's , playing around with the cd changer . buying a monthly subscription for xm radio . I have a 8gb flash drive and tested that baby out and boy does that ever work . But i happened to think to myself . Well my side kick and her nokia both are mp3 players and use a usb cable to add the songs onto the phone so i said hell i try it . Well wouldn't you know .. it works . i was shocked and so happy . now i can just plug my cell into the radio to hear the music instead of the headphones . what a bargain . Not to mention . I don't like having to pull out the usb flash every time i want to hear something else . So i used my power inverter and hooked up my 250gb usb hd to the radio and that works too . GOD DAMN i love this radio . Well I 'm sure all usb radios can do this but for the fact i got it dirt cheap . i love this thing and I 'm gonna buy 6 more of these and save them for my family and friends and myself . Its deff a great radio . Stop reading this and buy one !  
1	  This purchase was an absolute waste of money . I threw out the packing material before I realized what an inferior product I had purchased . The batteries hold little charger . The charger broke after 3 uses . Complete was of $ . The camera itself is a jewel . The charger is absolute junk .  
2	  The Canon PowerShot A460 Camera is everything that I had hoped for and the price was very good . However , I think that a wait of 19 days for delivery was excessive .  
2	  This is so worth the $ ' s you 'll spend . Now I can just pop the flash memory from my camera and pop it right in the IntelliFlash which sits nice and tidy on my desk ( I happily got to remove another random cable floating around in my office ) . I have been able to download pictures in half the time . It has multiple slots for compact flash memory , memory sticks , smart media cards , MMC and SD cards . Installation was a breeze . I use Windows XP so all I had to do was plug it in and re-boot my system . It took about 5 minutes MAX .. no drivers to load ! Definitely a good buy !  
2	  This is a must if you like keeping cords uncut .. I have so many 1/4 inch cables that I just wanted a quick fix , and these did it ! 5 stars :)  
1	  Cannot zip case with Sony D-NF340 . I never expected this from Sony . As a result player slips out of bag from time to time .  
2	  I bought two of these cameras for my kids . They are easy to use and have a variety of use options ( timer , video , still shots ) . My one critique is they burn through batteries fairly fast , so use rechargeable AA 's instead of disposable !  
2	  I had seen this case but never held it in my hand . When it arrived , seemed compact , as I wanted it to be . I have a Cybershot S 80 and although its a small camera , but when I placed it in the case with the adapter and the USB A / V cable , it kind of gets bulky . But Overall its a great camera case not only for Sony but other cameras .  
1	  very bad hardware . After 4 weeks the router started to hang , and I had to reboot it to unlock it . Now this happens every hour , and anyway when it is working my pages take 5 second to load , slower than dial up and I am on cable . I own and have used lynksis , netgear and belkin , all of them without a problem . I bought smc because of a professional review , but this is bad equipment . Their support is terrible , if you go to their website you cannot even find new or old firmware for this model . of course they don't want to honor the warranty because " it is working " . Stay away !  
2	  I moved my home audio to a different area of the room than where my TV is . I had to purchase an extender for the IR receiver and with this product I was set . I will say that the sticky tape that came with this is pretty cheap so I used some 3M product I got at Walmart to hold both the IR receiver to the TV and the component itself to the inside of my cabinet . Easy to install and easy to use .  
2	  This is an old model from Sony , though they still compete well enough with newer models that cost up to four times as much . My previous pair of the MDR-W08L lasted nearly five years before the wires became worn in the casing . The price is a bargain for the quality of sound these headphones consistently deliver . Furthermore , they allow for a slight amount of natural sound to enter the ears , thus allowing for safety while running , biking , subway travel , etc .  
2	  I have had this for about 2 weeks now . I have not used it for a family portrait , but I did use it from some night shots . I like being able to get my shot in focus , step away from the tripod and just push the remote button and it will take the picture no jiggling the camera or bumping the tripod when you have to push the button on the camera ! The range is very small when firing from behind the camera , but more then acceptable . The remote does everything it needs to in my opinion and is easy to operate . I say for this price it is hard to beat . Worth having in your camera bag .  
2	  This is a great printer . I 've had mine for about 3 years . I 'm moving , so I 'm now selling it . I Googled it to see what the used prices are for it and tripped over this review page . The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I used it for graduate school , and I printed a lot . It had a tendency to jam up pretty often . However , I learned fast to ruffle the paper a bit and that stopped most of it . It still jams from time to time or takes two pieces of paper where it only ought to be taking one . However , it 's a great scanner . It 's also a great fax . I live abroad and , from time to time , I have to fax documents home to the States . This makes it easy . Also , having a copier at home is just convenient . Now I write for a national paper and do other freelance writing assignments . I also teach , so being able to take work home and work efficiently is great . Being able to scan , fax , copy and print at will from home makes what I do very easy . Basically , it 's affordable and makes things flow seamlessly . When I return home to the States I might even pick up a used version of the same printer . That 's how pleased I 've been with it . ( Reality kicking in .. when I get home , I 'll probably get the newest HP multifunction printer . )  
2	  needed a new card for a small flip cam for my kid . this does the trick , but isn't anything special .  
1	  I received my Zen V Plus as a Christmas present in 2006 . When I first started using it , I was extremely happy with what I had got . Everything worked nicely , the screen was good , sound quality was good . As much asThe first time it froze up on me , I didn't know what to do at all . I found the reset button , and then I had to go searching for an earring or other small object . This has happened numerous times , and it 's an extreme pain to have to deal with every so often . Secondly , the joystick may seem like an improvement to others , but to me , it 's quite a pain . Personally , I have a lot of songs on my player . When I want to find a band or song that falls between J and O , I have to hold it down for the longest time just to find the right song . Then , I usually wind up passing it and having to go back , which requires more thumb pressing . Once in a while , I 'll push the stick the wrong way , and lose the list . When I go back to the list then , I have to start back from the top once more , just to find that one song . Up until a few weeks ago , I thought the joystick was the most of my problems . Over time , my screen started to get darker . I thought it might have been lack of charging from my end , since I had a tendency to bring it with me to school , and then forget about it in my bag until the next morning . I plugged it into my computer , with that lone cord they give you , and nothing improved . I gave in , and went to the main Creative website and found out what was wrong : for some reason , the screen on the players sometimes get darker , and darker . Eventually , then all go black , and you can't see anything at all . The only way to fix this , is to send it in for a new one . Now , I 'd be fine with this , but it requires you to have saved the receipt and I received mine as a gift , so I don't have the receipt . I had really high hopes for this one after having a few problems with my old iPod . Experiencing this makes me want to return to iPods . If you are considering buying this , consider it carefully . And as others have said , it has it 's pros but it has many more cons .  
2	  Even though these are not the " top of the line " Plossls , close inspection shows they didn't skip on the necessary steps that go into a quality eyepiece . The casings are metal and do not in any way feel like plastic as other reviews may imply . The internal filter threads are darkened to minimize unwanted reflections . The optic elements themselves , along with being fully anti-reflection coated , are edge-blackened , a step most ' cheap ' eyepieces ignore and another way to reduce internal reflections and light loss . Like any eyepiece , care must be taken when removing filters not to loosen the casing as they are designed to come apart . This is not a sign of poor craftsmanship , just thread it back on until snug . Far better Plossls do exist , but if you 're looking to get your first set of 1.25 " eyepieces this is the way to do it .  
1	  This hub worked fine and was easy to set up . Some how after about a month it quit working at all . Anything connected to it would not function . The only things I had attached to it was two Printers and a 2gb thumb drive . I just installed the replacement hub ( different brand ) so we will see if this goes south after about a month .  
1	  Be careful when purchasing this cable . I hooked it up and my tv made a horrible noise when I turned it on so I disconnected it . Thank god it didn't damage it  
2	  I have been using the iPod all week . I enjoy taking it on long walks , thinking I can outlast the battery life . This never happens . The battery life is extraordinary . I have owned cd walkmen that play two or three cd 's before completely draining their .. batteries . This electronic gadget outlast 's my own stamina . I don't have to worry about battery life . Worth it ? Yes . Just as I wonder if I will ever outlast my iPod 's battery , I wonder about the hard drive . Will I ever get enough worthy music to fill the entire 4.6 GB ? Does enough worthy music even exist ? I could fill the iPod with music I would never feel the urge to listen to . I could ! But I won't this device deserves honorable music . Thankfully , 80 dollars worth of cd 's came with the iPod . I pledge not to disgrace my iPod with poor music selections . More hard drive space than I could ever correctly fill ? Worth it ? Yes . One drawback is my shyness around my iPod . I have to hide it all the time , in order to keep people from getting jealous . If I took this thing into work ? Look out . It could really endanger my career . People would think I am getting paid way too much , or possibly a spy . I have to hide this awesome thing . It is like wearing a 5 pound gold nugget on your neck . Don't get mugged !  
2	  I 've had the MFC-4800 for over 4 years now , and it has been nothing but reliable . I have no idea why the negative reviewers have had so many problems , but unless it 's mechanical , it 's probably not the fault of the printer . I 've been able to fax , scan , copy and print thousands of pages without a single problem , even though I 've done nothing to maintain it . Toner is cheap and good number of pages per cartridge , too . It 's about as easy to use as a multifunction printer can get , I suppose . There are a few issues with this printer , one of which is that when the printer goes to sleep on power save , once in a long while it will be dropped by Windows 2000 ( a simple power cycle of the printer and reboot of the PC gets it back ) , but no problems on XP so far . And yes , as one of the reviewers stated , MFC-4800 is really not meant to be a network printer ( although Brother does sell compatible print servers ) . Otherwise , I have had very few paper jams / misfeeds , handles thick card stock paper well ( since the feed path is straight in and flat ) . Very few , if any , computer-related products can ever be called an " investment " , but this one has definitely given me more than what I expected for the price I paid . I'give it 4.5 stars , but 4 would be unfair , so I give it a 5 .  
1	  This pad looks great and provides good cooling . However , the cooling pad only worked for approximately one month . I use an HP 15.5 " laptop that tends to run hot when the video card is being utilized greatly for movies or games . The laptop runs so hot that it is harming the monitor and I will need to have it replaced . The Altec Laptop Cooling Pad worked great for about one month . It lowered the heat of the laptop considerably . The laptop was no longer hot to the touch and the monitor was not being harmed . However , after one month , the fans worked intermittently and then ceased functioning altogether . The pad was receiving power ( the LED light showed that power was being received ) and I tried toggling the fan speed between high and low , but nothing . Bottom line : Great laptop cooler for about one month . After that , it will cease functioning .  
1	  Like almost everyone else , I loved my Rio Nitrus with a passion UNTIL 35 days later ( 5 days too late for Best Buy to give a refund ) when I reached the dreaded UPGRADER screen . This is where I stand now . I am trying to download the software upgrade since the firmware timed out and wouldnt load . If this doesnt work than the Indian Lady said to send it back and theyd replace it with a player that doesnt have my 365 songs and hours of invested time . For anyone looking for an mp3 player that wont break , THIS AINT IT .  
2	  This is my very first digital voice recorder and I bought it to record lectures at college . I go to a small community college and so we sit close together , which means you can hear everything the person sitting next to you , behind your or 2 rows back . That is where the 4 stars only come in . If I record the lecture then try and play back right away , via the speaker , not the headphones , I can hear the professor , but I have to turn the volume up all the way , I can really hear the person 2 rows back the coughed , or when I erased something in my notebook , or the chalk / marker on the board . That is annoying . If I put noise reduction on high , it does help , but it 's not crystal clear , however it is a DVR , so we can't expect miracles . If I do the same thing ( noise reduction ) and play it though the earbuds , it 's much clearer , pretty much like when I sat there and listened to the lecture , I 've figured out that this is because it 's playing back in mono via the speaker , and stereo via the earbuds . Note the setting I have it on is " conference " , not dictation , bc even though I sit up front , the teachers constantly move around and dictation wouldn't pick up everything , however I may try it one day . The design is great , but it would have been nice to have a case , however , a quick fix to that is buy a hard eye glasses case and you have a nice sturdy case ! I saw one review that complained there was not off switch and they kept removing the batteries . Had they read the directions , they would have found out the " hold " switch on the side is your off button . The external mic which comes w / it is neat , but really cuts your time down , so I don't use it . The buttons are easy to use , as are the directions , if you read every step , and there is a handy card that tells you everything that you can keep w / your DVR . It has great features , see item description , all of which do what they say they do ! It DOES NOT come w / the remote as shown in this listing , but you don't need it . I did not buy this to play music , but for giggles I tried it and wow , I was impressed ! It was CD quality ! I 'd keep some on there , but again , that would cut my time down too much and I like to record on HQ , making it fast and easy to upload the files to my computer since they record on HQ in wma format . The uploading or downloading is fast and simple . I can download a 1 hour file in less than 30 seconds to my computer . I love my new toy and it will stay w / me for my college career ! I just wish they would have made it chargeable and / or did something about it not picking up every single ambient noise .  
1	  Just like several other reviewers , I experienced a sudden loss of signal in one channel - in my case , it came after about 10 months of light use . Not recommended !  
2	  Bought a SDHC card .. and bought the " highest quality " in Class 6 . I don't see the difference between this one and my old 1 gb SD card ( not a High Capacity card ) . Paid a premium for this one when I could have gotten something else for much cheaper and same production . Well , it does its job and saves everything . Everything is always saved up well and it connects to any device easily .  
2	  excellent high-frequency response . I was surprised at how good they sound and yet they allow one to hear " outside " sounds .  
2	  Alright , for those of you out there ( like me ) who do not have an option to play your mp3 files in your , but to buy something like this ( or those 20th century cassete adapter ) here it goes . This product is amazing . In other words , it works right out of the box . It 's easy to set up and get going . However , it is a bit ( tiny ) tricky to change both the radio station and the device while driving . Is it good for going to and from work ? YES . Does it hav lots of static ? Maybe , depends where you live ( I guess ) . I live in a New York suburb and yes the stations are still crowded , but mine works best at 88.1 and 88.5 , I guess you jsut need to find you rsweet spot . What do I use ? I use my blackberry 8330 . It sounds clear and the quality is very dependable . Best is when I get a call and I simply hit the " talk " button and walla there , through the car speakers is the person 's voice . Is it worth the price ? Anytime . I went to Radio Shack and they had their brand one for $ 35 . So it will beat their price anytime . I , an educated shopper like you , would recommend this product to anyone . After all , what do others expect for teh price ?  
2	  I 've had this unit in my htpc for 4 years now without a hiccup . Zalman invented the idea of silent power suppliers and I love them . This unit is silent and the modular cables are plentiful and of very high quality . I also have their their 420 watt model in my main PC and it is 6 years old and never had a problem . There are other good options out there now for silent psus , but you can't go wrong with the quality of the Zalmans .  
2	  I just got this paper , from a local shop . And having now printed out a total of two pics , on a Canon Pixma iP4200 .. it seems great . The colors are very strong , but slightly brighter than on my computer screen . And B & W ; came out less attractive , more purple than true black , also over all lighting was darker than on my computer screen . However both of those things could be a printer calibrating problem . This paper is very heavy , beautiful high gloss finish and the perfect size for my printer . One side point ; This paper being so heavy , and so glossy you have to wait 12 to 24 hours before framing , etc . Beacuse this paper needs time to dry . So no " quicky " projects with this stuff .  
2	  I wish I could say something special about Memorex 's CD media in comparison to other brands I 've bought and used , but I can't . They have all worked well . What I can say is that I bought this 50-Pack when it was on sale , it arrived quickly , and if it 's ever on sale when I need more , I 'll buy it again .  
1	  These don't work in a Phillips CDR-200 burner . I get the NO-OPC error message . If anyone has found ones that work in this burner , please let me know ! Having an impossible time finding ones that do .  
2	  I started trying to find one of these from the moment I read about them . Being from a Minnesota company , I was even more interested . The device promised to address a couple of key things for me . The wifi link would allow me to put new music on without worrying about leaving an adapter at home or at the office , and the built in FM transmitter meant that I wouldn't need an extra gadget to use it through my car stereo . I won't bore you with the hassle of trying to buy it at the " national electronics retailer " who had the initial exclusive on distribution , but I finally did get one . It has basically met all of my expectations . I have a couple of minor quibbles about the firmware , but they have been releasing some patches to it quite quickly , all seeming to tweak the usability , so I imagine these quibbles may be all gone by the time you are reading this . Battery life seems OK , but it 's tough to get a precise sense of it . I use it both in the car through the radio ( the ability to have it use any FM frequency plus the ability to find the most " open " frequency is great ! ) and with headphones while working , and I don't think I 've had it down past the halfway point for power . If I have any complaint , I guess it would be that the included case isn't so great . I would have preferred a clear / flexible plastic front over the display and controls . Then I could more easily use it while gardening while keep it protected . An additional aesthetic consideration . A couple of friends who have seen it don't like the look of it so much . I agree that it could probably be better in some ways , however , it looks great in a car with a brushed-metal dashboard .  
2	  This recorder works great for the classroom . I have owned voice recorders before , but this one has many great features . First , all the buttons are easy to use & find - not as small as my previous recorder . I especially like the " pause " button , which is great when you want to stop recording ( it doesn't distract the speaker by making a loud noise , like you would if you hit the stop button ) , and is also useful when you are playing back the tape and want to take notes . The pause button is also located at a convient spot - no where near other buttons so you don't accidently hit " rewind " or the dreaded " PLAY " button in the middle of class ! I also picked this recorder because it has a counter on it to help me match my notes with the tape . I must point out that I was in the second row of my classroom , and the teacher spoke loudly . I had one professor who did not speak as loud , and I have trouble hearing * everything * he says on playback . However , I was impressed that the recorder itself was quiet , and cause minimal " noise " on the tape . I do plan to buy a microphone , however , so that the sound of the tape recorder will not effect the sound as much ( for the softer-speaking teacher ) . I would recommend this recorder and have no regrets in purchasing it . I think it is probably one of the best in it 's price range . It should be noted , however , that this recorder takes normal sized tapes , NOT mini-cassettes .  
1	  The quality of this item was very poor . The power plug did not fit snug & therefore fell out easily ; there were 3 bright pixels that distracted from the viewing ; the AV in did not function properly . This discourages me from buying other Coby products . However , Amazon did refund my full purchase , as well as that of the case I had bought with it .  
2	  Pros : 1 . Long battery life up to 50 hours ! 2 . Small and light enough to carry3 . Easy to control with shuttle switch4 . Fancy design5 . AVS function which cares for your hearing abilityCons : 1 . No voice recording function2 . Clumsy detachable clip3 . A little bit expensiveWhat 's your priority when you choose this kinda cool gadgets ? The most important priority for me was battery life . NW-E507 lasts at least twice longer than existing MP3 players , which means you don't have to worry about the battery life when you listen to music . Assuming to play 4 hours a day , you don't need to recharge this for TWO weeks ! I use NW-E507 without taking it out from my pocket because the shuttle is really easy to control . One thing that many people mentioned in previous reviews is that the inconvenience of provided software . I don't quite understand why they are saying that .. It 's not that complicated to use SonicStage . Once you install it , you can transfer mp3 files from your computer to NW-E507 with ease . On top of that you can shrink the size of the original mp3 files so that you can store more songs than other MP3 players with limited memory . Also , there is no problem with recognizing foreign language ( such as Korean ) if it 's supported on NW-E507 . I guess the tip for installing Sonicstage is setting the area the same as the language you want to be displayed on NW-E507 . One annoying thing is the repeat button on the back of the gadget . The button is too small and hard to press when the detatchable clip is attached . I hope SONY improves this later for the forthcoming models . Overall , this is really a great player and I think this is worth $ 150 . I hope this helps ~  
2	  I had moved my computer into a home theatre stand and needed a front-loading solution for USB devices . This bay worked perfect .. easy install , easy use , great price .  
2	  I 'm surprised that this mount takes the abuse it does . I 've got it mounted on the dashboard of my power boat and I 've not had any problems with it so far . Once set properly it holds the gps in place at the correct angle . No problems with salt spray and the gps shifting out of position . Great little mount  
1	  It seemed like a great idea . So small , more then enough room to store the images I was taking for my first digital job on my first digital camera and super cheap . I 'm not too tech smart and had a friend set it up to run with my MAC as it didn't recognize it at first . All was well until it turned over on itself . Now I know it was probably my fault . But just beware of 2 things if you are a newbie like me . The USB cord is very short and a little unstable in its connection . There is no room to wiggle if you are on a laptop . And second is they must be very sensitive right ? if you loose every single thing on it just because it turns over ! For the record it turned over I didn't drop it . Everything I had taken was lost .  
2	  Very pleased with the camera , easy to use and produced good quality photos ; annoyingly , it was stolen from my apt . , so I 've just ordered another . Glad to report I 'm now moved to a safer area . Wish camera came with case and good strap , had to buy a case . Mark .  
1	  Got this for my existing CD cleaning machine that has a worn out wheel . This wheel did not fit the machine , it would not stay on during operation . Useless purchase for me .  
1	  Ipod came shipped in about 3 days , everything looked great , started out great . But after the first charge expired it hasn't held a charge for more than an hour since . Really not happy about spending the money on this item , would never do it again . Actually trying to get my money back at the moment .  
2	  The new cartridge promises 3000 sheets . I 've so far printed about 25 sheets , and I 'm pleased with the results . Time will tell whether or not the thing can produce 300 sheets as good as the first 25 , let along all 3000 . Installation was easy for my Samsung ML-2010 . I 'm happy with what I received .  
1	  Other than the fact that it just didn't work , there 's the little things , like selecting 128 bit encryption mode to be compatible with my home network and finding out you can only enter 10 characters instead of 16 making it impossible to configure . I hope they didn't pay the monkey they used for testing this product very much .  
2	  Works amazingly well for the low price point . My Phenom 's cores haven't ever gone past 150ish , even with a full load . And that 's using the standard heatsink-fan combo provided by AMD . More than enough for numerous applications , too ! Awesome Product !  
1	  1 . This frequently dooesn't work on a cloudy day or near an airport2 . I live in NY and my work in Manhattan . But This only works normal only in 1/3 area in manhattan even with gps antena I bought seperatively ( 20dollor ) . 3 . It comes with 128 m memory card . But It can not have the minimal size of Map ; Map for one state . So I had to buy 1 Mb SD card ( 40 dollor ) 4 . It responds too late on a highway that I had to wait or go wrong way . 5 . Whenever I go long journey , I have to change Map with my Laptop notebook . 6 . Finaly I had to buy another one ( c530 ) . Unfortunately total price for c320 . gps anttena and meory card was almost same as sigle c 530.7 . Never buy this one please .  
1	  This system is WAY too expensive . I considered buying one until i actually heard it . There is NO BASS ! So you have to buy a subwoofer if you want good sound from it . If you add it up ( 400 for the stereo , 300 for a decent subwoofer ) 700 BUCKS !  
2	  Wow ! What a VD gift for myself . The HK 3480 matched to Polk speakers . The receiver is plenty powerful enough for smaller listening environments . Multi-inputs and outputs ( yes , one can bi-wire the speakers ) , minimalist front panel features . Remote is ok , not backlit or glow in the dark . I think I 'm going to love the VMax feature . Have tried it on Mannheim Steamroller - " Classical Gas " , Queen Latifah - " Dana Owens Album " really has depth from the crystal clear highs , deep , non-rumbling lows and her voice and the brass-wonderful ! Have tried it with Linda Ronstadt 's " Cry Like a Rainstorm , Howl Like the Wind " , Nina Simone 's " The Blues " sounded like I was in the studio with her . Triple-level lights and panel are appreciated when one doesn't want a big glowing machine in an otherwise darkened room . I 'm looking forward to trying this with a Deadwood DVD or maybe dig out the Matrix . My listening expectations are rising by the minute .  
2	  Excellent product . The microphone is clear and speakers do not produce feedback . Easy setup . The mouse is excellent with a nice indicator of battery level . The only complaint I have is that the F1-F12 keys are too short in height compared to the other keys and that there 's no scroll wheel for easy scrolling while surfing the web .  
2	  Just got the stand delivered and I must say the quality is very good . One of a few stands you can actually open the laptop without it falling over . Go over to youtube and watch the reviews from itsmemorphious . He does a great job detailing the pros and cons from his experience . The one thing I am disappointed on is the cabling system ( hole ) in the back of the stand . You can't fit a mini display port to DVI cable through it . Thus , you can't string your Apple Cinema Display connection through it or any display using a mini display port ( VGA or DVI ) adaptor . That is a big oversight . All they need to do is widen the hole . Considering they advertise with an Apple Cinema Display next to a macbook on the stand , they should have catered for the connection as well . Other than that .. I find in this stand everything I was looking for . Great ergonomics , lifts my macbook up off the desk top so I can rest my wireless keypboard and mouse underneath and gives a good home in the back of my setup . Also , the heat dissipation seems good . Aluminum conducts heat better than air so just b / c it rests on rubber feet ( good quality feet by the way ) doesn't mean you aren't getting good flow as it still pulls away heat . Good product . Watch daily for it to get down to the low 40 's before you buy .  
1	  I read the reviews for both the " silent " and non-silent version of this power supply and decided to spend the extra cash for the quiet version . The silent power supply functions fine , but it is by no means silent or even quiet . It 's very loud . I can't imagine how loud the non-silent version is . The stock powersupply that came with my PC 's case was much much quieter than this " silent " coolmax . If I had it to do over again , I would buy something else . I may even shop around for another and just keep the Coolmax as a spare .  
1	  I have used two different Pantone products previously and each worked far better than this one . I am disappointed and no longer use it .  
1	  I regret buying this product since day1 u have to reboot it again and again and now atlast after 6 months only it died on me .  
2	  I have other linksys routers and switches in my house and this works great in conjuction with them .. I have never even had to power anything off .. the data flows nicely and smoothly .  
1	  Although the TV Ears were easy enough to install , they worked for only one or two uses . When they stopped working , I called the number on the brochure , but they didn't get back to me in a timely way . I finally packed the device up and sent it back , then the company called me . To bad , too late . What little use I had was very helpful .  
1	  I bought this Celestron T-ring to adapt a Televue Pronto to a Canon 40D . It does work but the fit is very loose and sloppy . It does not make me convinced that the camera is securely supported or that it holds the camera with any precision ( optically speaking ) to the scope . One other problem , at shutter speeds of 1/4000 or faster and using the live-view mode of the 40D , there is an under-exposed strip on the bottom of each exposure . Because I haven't tried the Canon T-ring I can't say whether this flaw is unique to the Celestron but I would recommend spending a few more bucks for the Canon T-ring for the better fit I would assume it has .  
2	  Uniden 300-Channel Clock Radio ScannerVery good scanner has all the features that anyone would need to have . Also at this price it is a very good deal .  
2	  Excellent product ! Great sounding headphones ! I use mine while on my computer . Would recommend these to a friend .  
1	  All of the glowing reviews of this product are just great .. except for the fact they have all been written within months of buying this TV . Sure , this TV had a great picture and worked fine when I purchased it in October 2005 directly from Philips . ( Only problem I noticed , which others seem to have had as well was that every so often it would turn itself off and back on again . ) All was great until August 2008 when horizontal orange lines appeared across 80 % of the screen . Customer service was useless and referred me to a local repair shop , where I was informed that for no apparent reason , the main panel was shot and would cost $ 1,800 to replace . Since I had only extended the warranty for the first two years I owned the TV , I was out of luck and out of a TV . So , after reading all these folks sing the praises of this product , keep in mind that it 's only a matter of time before this product dies on you . Unless you 're interested in a plasma TV with a three year life , I advise you to avoid Philips .  
2	  We LOVE the Zune . This was a great purchase . The only downside is there are not that many accessories for it yet . In time I am sure there will be though .  
2	  I purchased this actually somewhere else , but anyways this is a replacement for my 4 year old Dell . My original drive died probably from too much vibration . I love for the fact that is has " DuraStep Ramp ( tm ) " which parks the head during sudden movements , since I 'm always on the go . This drive is so much more quite than my previous one , but it does get somewhat warm .  
2	  I have bought these headphones twice , which shocks both myself as well as my friends . I have a nasty habit of trying out any and all headphones I can find and lightning never strikes in the same spot twice , or does it ? Comfort : I find them to be very comfortable over a long duration of time especially when standing or running . However if you are typing on a laptop in your bed leaning your head on your hand the headphones are quite painful due to this unique design . If you are planning on doing so and nothing else a better solution would be the Sennheiser CX300 's . Despite how comfortable these headphones are , they will never be as comfortable as some in-ears , but thats not what these headphones are all about . ( Note : The twist-to-fit washers are replaceable with multiple provided sizes ) Stay-in-ability : This is probably the most crucial problem with earbuds today and probably the main reason you 're here . I bought these headphones when I had to train for the USAF PT Test . This includes pushups , crunches , and a run . These are the only earbuds or really headphones in general that could handle the challenge . They have never fallen out once when working out or running and if you can find any better ' phones for this situation I will shake your hand . Quality : As far as audio quality is concerned I find them to be extremely top notch in comparison to others of this style . These are not in-ear headphones . They will not plug in and they will not give you any bass whatsoever , that being said for what they are the sound is excellent . Construction : The cord is made out of a more coarse rubber which will make it stick to itself and tangle easier than normal in the pocket . The headphones are also very easy to break , not due to poor construction , but design . The twist-to-fit washers at the top are very easy to lose and if you were to step on these buds the wrong way you can break off the twist-to-fit part . Lest we forget the neon green and the asymetrical design . Sweat Survivability : These buds went through a heavy soil cycle in the washing machine and not only lived to tell the tale , but were still in perfect operational order and quite pleasant smelling . Needless to say your ear sweat is nothing to worry about . Conclusion : If you 're walking , running , or working out there is no better headphone on the market , except of course theSennheiser MX85 Sport Series II Twist to Fit Stereo For Sportswhich came out recently and I have yet to purchase . If you 're looking for something while you 're in the back of a car or an airplane theSennheiser CX300-B Earbuds ( Black ) will be a better fit .  
2	  Fast shipping and a smoke'n price . Just what I was looking for and cheap enough to keep some in the camper , garage and my truck .  
2	  DVI male to male . Best price for a reliable almost 10ft cable . You cannot go wrong with these . They arrived with the quickness . Great product !  
1	  This battery would not turn the camera on , so I charged it in the charger that came with the camera and it still won't turn the camera on . I would return it but I don't have the original packaging . Don't buy one !  
1	  I bought this protector and it died in less than 6 months . Save your money .  
1	  I purchased Plextor for what I thought was a quality product . However , now after about 18 months of not very heavy use it has failed ( I can no longer burn a DVD ) . So , while it worked better than a previous SONY DVD writer ( it never burned a single DVD ) the Plextor has not lived up to my expectations . So I cannot recommend it .  
2	  This is my second tripod and I usually use SLRs for photography . I was amazed by the quality of this tripod for an under $ 50 budget . I have checked out few in FRYs , Bestbuy , brands like Velbom , Sunpak .. but this one is far superior to those . I would suggest this for everyone , as long as your not a pro / I am really satisfied with Amazon and Sony  
2	  I bought this for backup for my Canon SD630 . Works great ! Definitely useful to have for travelling and long photo sessions .  
2	  I bought these headphones as a gift for my father . The sound quality is great and for the price , you cant beat it ! They fit over the ear perfectly , totally would buy for someone else in the future !  
1	  I waited 3 weeks for this printer cartridge to come in . It apparently got lost in the mail somewhere in the western part of the country . But Amazon made good and refunded my money promptly when I sent them an e-mail explaining what happened . FYI - Be sure you keep up with any order numbers you get if you order anything from anywhere .  
2	  I highly recommend this product ! It 's very easy to use and charges your iPod while whether or not you 're using it when driving . I previously tried a different FM Transmitter for my iPod , and it just did not compare . The sound quality is great , and the chance of static is slim to none . You can't go wrong with this ! :)  
2	  I bought this unit after going through two Garmin Etrex units . The Magellan holds a signal better , and is less susceptible to damage caused by vibrations such as those encountered on a bicycle . It is larger than the Etrex units , but not significantly so .  
1	  You 'd be better off sticking a pair of cut up pieces of straw in your ears . The head piece is entirely too small , unless you 've been stricken by a band of tropical head hunters . The sound emanating from the earphones is more like what one would find in the bottom of a cave , and optional silicone ear plugs made me want to go visit jack kevorkian to end the excruciating pain . These sorry things don't even deserve a single star . Donate your $ 34 to a worthy cause , go splurge and treat yourself to sort of decent meal , or help the poor American auto industry put $ 34 down on a car !  
1	  As I sit here on hold for the past 15min for Lyra tech support , I have time to reminisce over the first call about 45min ago when the tech didn't even believe this model existed . A small smile touches my lips when I think of my coy little Lya RD2820 , too shy to FREAKIN WORK . This thing blew up like Hiroshima . I installed the software on my WinXP box , plugged it in , the Lyra screen showed a connection in progress and WinXP failed the plug & play . Since then , connected or not , my Lyra still thinks it 's connected and there is - no way to shut the damn thing off - . The power button doesn't work , the battery can't be removed . Needless to say it refuses to be recognized by any machine in my home now , XP or 2K . All the technicians right now are huddling in a little group figuring out if they have any tech skills between them . Isn't technology wonderful ?  
2	  A very retro way to take pictures for sure . However , it seems this is the hot thing for my teenager . Who knew she and her friends would love this thing . She is the only one who has a new one , and she seems to love it . It is exactly like the one I had years and years ago .  
2	  I bought a Voodoo3 3000 PCI some time ago and then upgraded to a Voodoo5 5000 - This was great but my new machine does not support it - so I put back in my old PCI Voodoo3 expecting a real let down and I can tell you it 's a pleasant suprise , Quake 3 , Unreal , Alien v Predator , Star Trek Armada II and Kingpin are just some of the games I use and they run superbly - No juddering , freezing or glitching just smooth good quality action . Now 3dfx has been bought out by nVidia look at the .. site for excellent new drivers which keep this amazing card bang up to date .  
2	  Good product and works great ! The only thing , the box on the wire gets warm to touch . Other than that one thing , I 'm glad I found this product .  
2	  I guess a cable either works or it does not work . The one I got works well .  
1	  This unit is riddled with bugs . [ .. ] . htmbut it does very little to fix the problems of this model . It is EXTREMELY difficult to get it to finalize dvds . The quality with the rf connection is horrible . It 's a nightmare to get around on some of the menus . I would save my money and try a different manufacturer .  
2	  I like this DVR . It runs quite and has the latest MPEG4 compression . Good picture quality , use cameras with 480 TV lines to get the best results . The remote is poor so you will likely need to operate it from the front panel but the controls are very user friendly . I recommend this DVR for anyone looking for a low cost cctv solution .  
2	  This mouse works great with my MacBook . It 's the perfect size and took 4 secs to get it up and running . I really like that the mouse is all plastic and does not have the rubber garbage that a lot of mice add nowadays ( that stuff ALWAYS ends up slipping off with a lot of use and it 's nasty ) . Logitech is the way to go ! ( Other BT mice I saw were running $ 79 plus )  
2	  This is a brilliant idea to put wifi in a palm ! I use it on a corporate as well as a home wifi network , and saves a ton of time and really easy to setup . Extremely happy with it , even elated . About 5 days after purchase , the device specific MAC address became corrupted , so no longer works on my corporate network ( which uses host filtering ) . If you just run this on a home wifi network or your corporate network doesn't authenticate each device trying to connect to wifi network using a specific , unique MAC host address , this problem won't trip you up . After lots of sleuthing ( no real help on the palm website ) , I came across several posts about this problem in various user groups from spring / summer of 2003 . Apparently this problem has happened , out of the blue , to a few other people . Apparently there is a ROM fix that should prevent this from happening ( although Palm is cryptic in its description ) , but once it does happen , that fix can no longer be applied . I was surprised that the ROM upgrade had not been applied to a device I purchased new from Amazon nearly 9 months later , and there was no word from Palm about the need to apply the upgrade either in the box or via email . Bottom line - I have returned the device to Amazon ( on Palm tech support 's advice ) , and am eagerly awaiting a 2nd NEW one . The Palm tech support person told me if I returned it to Palm , I 'd likely get a refurbished model .. So if you use wifi a lot , and don't want to pay for a separate wireless / cellphone account ( eg as with all the other wireless models out there - blackberry charges run $ 70 a month around here ) , this is a great device . Buy it , and apply the ROM upgrade available on Palm 's site right away !  
2	  Thanks ! Arrived on time and works great for what I needed it for . I really don't know what else to say .  
2	  My husband purchased this particular television in October 2005 . We 've never had any problems with it , and it continues to function beautifully . One thing I 'm confused about : description indicates it has an HDTV monitor , yet I 've been told it 's not actually an HD television . I don't see a difference in quality of picture when watching a regular movie channel or the same channel on an HD channel , though picture quality is very good . Am I missing something ? Picture quality on other televisions that are HD capable seem to be far more crisp . Also , I 'm wondering since this set is 5 years old , will it function with a BluRay system , in terms of delivering that quality of picture ? Thank you . On a scale of 1-5 , with 5 being excellent , I give this television 4.5 . It 's proven to be a good investment .  
1	  I don't understand how this vacuum has such great reviews . Sure , it has a lot of metal parts . So what ? It still works terribly . My main gripe is that this vacuum cannot clean hard floors . It will kick dirt and debris around all over the place though . Try vacuuming a hard floor bare footed and you will actually FEEL the debris hitting your feet as they are shot around . On carpet , this vacuum does better , but again , it will still kick dirt around . I want a vacuum that will suck dirt and debris up , not fling it around everywhere . Also , I 'm not sure if this is due to our having dogs in the house , but whenever I use this vacuum , it immediately disperses a terrible smell consisting of hair , dander , and dirt . I 'm not really experienced with different vacuums , but it seems to me that they shouldn't do this . I do not recommend buying this vacuum .  
1	  Worked fine .. ONCE . I got one so-so 20 minute capture from VHS ( picture was poorly aligned and sound was severly attenuated ) , after that I got no love ( same tape ) . Software locks up requiring the machine to be turned off ( unplugging the device didn't cut it ) , and it doesn't work any better when it 's turned back on . I can't comment on the customer support cause I 'm not going to deal with them .. this dud it going back . Maybe it 's unreasonable , but I expect relatively simple devices to work as advertised out of the box . What I 'm really fired up about is the software seems to have corrupted my machine .. my soundcard promtly stopped working correctly after install . I HATE trying to nerd my way through the obscure corners of my computer trying to right things that would not have been wrong if not for a bad product .  
2	  The product does work ! The reason many people have so many problems are because they are idiots . The reason it does not work for them is because their video output does not support it or they are trying to hook up to a normal yellow tv input . Note , these are Red-Green-Blue inputs . They are for HDTV use . To see if your system will support this , then answer the following questions . Did you buy your system from Wal-mart ? Did you buy your system from Best Buy ? If you answered yes then there is a good chance it will not work because these retailers sell cheaply made systems with poor quality components . It is a rare case that they will actually support these cables .  
1	  I was happy with the sound and design . Then one day the LED would not light up . Not a big problem ; I had had this problem before and read the manual to see how to reset . This time the reset did not work . Nothing I do will make it work right though it 's obviously getting power and was never dropped or anything . I wrote Oregon Scientific 's help desk twice and never received a reply . Bad customer service policy guys ! I guess I 'll have to phone now and likely they 'll have me ship it back etc .. Seems like a pain for a solution that may not work and a product that wasn't so expensive to begin with . I think the electronics must be very delicate . I had only used it for 2 months when it went kaput ! I can't say I trust them anymore ..  
2	  We also have a larger pair of Pentax binoculars , but I love these little ones , as they are compact , lightweight and tough ! I can tuck them in a backpack , and they don't take up much space or add too much weight . The Pentax warranty is excellent !  
1	  I 've used split keyboards before and wanted to go back since my wrists started to hurt again recently so I ordered one of these . If you are typing on this rather cheaply made keyboard , then you are fine but if you are like me and need to use modifier keys with graphics programs , then you 'll hate this keyboard . They have mysteriously taken the control off of the left side and stuck a Help key in between it and option . Then they stuck a Power key above that with a numlock key kitty corner from it as well . It makes using the control key almost impossible as its like using your finger to navigate a mine field of uncommon keys that will invariably interrupt you ( a power down notice , your letters typing numbers or a help window opening ) . And to further add to the mess , the command key is way off to the left so you will spend a while mashing command shift , thinking it 's command-z or strain to reach over your thumb to hit command-t . Clearly not designed by someone who has used a Mac . Terrible - sending it back .  
1	  I had bad luck with this product . I found the setup process easy enough , but the box was not very reliable . Ever few days it would lock-up for some unknown reason . I had to power cycle the box to make it work again . I 've now replaced it with an equivalent Linksys 802.11g router box which has been problem-free .  
2	  I got the product very fast from Amazon . Since I did not need the ink that very same day , I did not need to buy it from the local store . So , I ordered from Amazon and it got to me in a week . I saved money that way and I got a good quality product .  
1	  This is NOT 18 Gauge wire its 12 gauge at best , And it is NOT 50ft More like 25ft . I surly got ripped off again at Amazon .  
2	  JUST WHAT WAS ORDERED . HAVEN'T TRIED IT YET , BUT SURE IT WILL COOK A GREAT POT OF BEANS AND MUCH MORE . WOULD RECOMMEND .  
2	  Years later , still using it , sound is vibrant and thumping . Do they still make these ? I could use another set . It was a great deal at the time .  
2	  After using this lense only a couple times I knew it was a must have for anyone using the R1 that wanted close up photos . Great product at a great price on amazon .  
1	  My ESCORT Solo was destroyed in a fire after almost eight years of wonderful use . Hence , I went shopping for a replacement , and like a complete fool , I tried to save $ 100 and bought this one ( Beltronics Express 946 Cordless ) about a year ago . To make a long story short , I finally tossed it in the trash today ( won't even subject it on someone else at an auction ) . If I got award " minus stars " I would on this miserable product . I will not even comment about the multiple false positives , or the absurd diplay which can not be read in the daytime , but what made me absolutely HATE this product - and by imputation everything by Beltronics - is the totally ridiculous mounting system . Every trip I spend just too much time and attention " adjusting " it as there is no real " locking " mechanism with regard to the " setting " once set . It tends to get loose and " pivot " around rendering it worthless as a detector . Once you finally get it set the way you need it , the suction cups do not " suck " very well , and it tends to fall off quite often at minor bumps and turns . This is quite dangerous as one tends to end up " adjusting " it while driving . Many times I have had to pull off the road to get it to work properly . It is obvious the designers put NO thought into the user experience , as it fails at nearly every level . A horrible product . It 's in my trashcan now and I 've just ordered the Passport 8500 X50 .  
2	  It works and that is high praise for these as many of these do not . This one is simple and effective . WORKS !  
2	  This cartridge was only 70 % full but for the price I guess I can't complain . I assumed it was a full one though so just be prepared .  
2	  I got this for myself after the holiday season with some $ and gift certificates I had received . ( I didn't buy it here . ) It 's SLICK . Yes I use an Altoids tin as a case . Yes it always gets comments from every single person I show it too . Yes it 's slick . Picture quality is O K. I find the autofocus a little finicky , but there are so many options to choose from when taking photos that I 'm sure with a little practice I 'll get every picture looking perfect . I find the battery to run a little on the weak side , hopefully their next version will be more robust . But so far , so good . I 'd recommend it . It 's just too cool .  
2	  I am a new to this product and so far I haven't found anything disappointing with it ! It 's a great product with alot of features !  
1	  Don't believe the advertising that is printed on the box ! I just setup my new Memorex DVD recorder with the intent of being able to use the included software to print Lightscribe labels .. as advertisied . However the " Essential " version of Nero that is included , acutally means basic or trial version and doesn't support Lightscribe . Even though Memorex was kind enough to put a " Bonus " Lightscribe CD-R in the package .. almost to rub in your face that you were tricked into believing what the manufacture claims on the box . What a rip off . I will not purchase any more items from Memorex .  
2	  My wife loves this kit for her photos on baking . She is satisfied and so am I. We did receive everything in the kit . Lights are cool .  
2	  I originally bought this remote to control my family room satellite box and AV receiver from my patio . I have a tv in the patio that is connected to the satellite box from the family room . I was concerned that the remote would not work , since I had bad luck with a radio shack rf / infrared solution . The remote works as advertised with great range . It was easy to program . It controls everything I need to for only 79.99 . I would have paid 200 bucks to get this performance . I liked it so much , that I bought a second one to control a tv in another room . I did not even have to connect the flashers . You can't beat this remote for the money .  
1	  The product fits a Treo 650 perfectly , and the buttons work well through the silicon , however I have a few complaints :( 1 ) There aren't any labels on the buttons that are covered by the silicon , so you need to memorize the functions . ( 2 ) The belt clip is white and very flimsy . I bought this case over others because it has a belt clip , and it turns out that the clip is barely usable .  
1	  I bought this one from Amazon . com 4 months ago . Here are the problems I had to deal with : 1 . Yes , unsurprisingly I am having the same touchpad problems . It is erratic ! It sometimes does not work and sometimes jumps from one corner to the other corner of the screen . 2 . Battery life is too short . 3 . This Notebook does NOT include RECOVERY CD 's . So , if you have a problem with your software you have nothing to do ! Customer support will tell you to order and pay for recovery CD 's ! ? Don't go for the style and the name and buy an IBM T40 .  
2	  Have been buying these Sony dvd 's for 10 yrs and burning movies etc and they work great . Cant believe the basd reviews as ive never had a bad disc out of hundreds . I suggest to you guys complaining these dont work well that you buy a better dvd burner as thats always the key thing needed for burning these discs or others . My dvd burner in my 10 yr old PC is a 7 yr old samsung burner and always works well - period .  
1	  I bought this DVD player in August and was happy with it until it broke down completely in November ! You certainly get what you pay for . I got maybe 20 hours of use from it . This is false economy . Pay a bit more and get something that last longer than 3-4 months .  
2	  I bought this remote to use for long exposures with my D60 . It has one button which does exactly what you 'd expect - opens and / or closes the shutter . Two minutes after I opened the package I was taking my first test shots , and that was only because I had to find the right settings on my camera . As some other reviews have pointed out , the remote has to be in line of sight with your camera 's sensor in order to work , but that is no great inconvenience for my needs .  
1	  This is a follow-up of my prior review . I have received a replacement product ( not new as was mine ) and it does work for now . I asked that they simply replace the Velcro strip on the back of the case since it can't be purchased from them on-line . After 3 calls to support , they refuse to help me with this 10 cent part . I 've never been so frustrated with a product in my life . I 'd think twice before you buy a Palm product .  
2	  The online code is a fast and secure way to buy MS Points . I bought and after a few minutes i received a e-mail with the code , put it on the xbox . com website and the points are credited to my account .  
2	  The new apple keyboards have black keys and clear plastic .. cool look and the usual functionality .  
2	  After trying several of the cheaper off-brand wireless remotes for my D7000 ( when the ML-L3 was out of stock nearly everywhere after I bought the camera ) , it was quickly obvious that you get what you paid for . None of the remotes had a range greater than maybe 5-7 feet MAX without having to press the button 10 times or so to get the camera to respond . THIS little guy , on the other hand , I can use quickly and easily at distances of at LEAST 15 feet away ( haven't tried more ) , and the camera has been extremely responsive at these distances . Either the transmitter on those other remotes is just terrible , or they are using a low output battery ; either way , BUY THIS REMOTE . This is indispensable for a tripod ( especially for taking family pics without having to leave yourself out of them . Sure , the timer will work , but good look getting a great pic with kids when you constantly have to go back and hit the shutter release . With this one , you can just fire off a bunch of shots and pick the best one , and you don't have to worry about being tethered to the camera by a cable ! Very small but easy to handle . Very light . Very essential .  
2	  I was really looking forward to receiving this digital picture frame in the mail . I was like a little kid ( and still am ) when I opened the Amazon . com shipping box , to reveal the colorful Kodak packaging with the long awaited digital picture frame in it . The digital frame was well packaged , protected with its own wrapping within the box , and a thin transparent sheet protecting the screen . Nothing the postman could have done could have damaged the product during shipping . The digital frame comes with a CD , for both Windows and Macintosh , and allows you to install in ten different languages : English , French , German , Italian , Spanish , Portuguese , Polish , Czech , and Turkish . During installation , you will be prompted on whether you would like to check the internet for a newer version of the software . I found that a newer version was available , and that was automatically downloaded and then seamlessly installed . The software is very easy to use and will automatically search your computer for all stored pictures . Within seconds ( depending on how many pictures you have ) you will have all your pictures neatly organized in one folder . A remote control , with battery included , is also in the package . It has a separate stand that attaches to the back of the frame , making it convenient to store your remote control . The remote control is a must , and turns the digital frame into a user friendly product . In fact , I didn't even have to read the owner 's manual . It is really very easy navigating the frame 's menus and settings . It is much easier setting this digital frame than your DVD player or microwave ! A few tips though : The remote buttons must be pressed hard and kept pressed for a good second ; you must be within a straight line and not too far away from the frame . If you are experiencing problems , change the battery . USB cables are also included to allow you to connect to your computer or directly to your digital camera . The USB cable will also allow you to upgrade the firmware on your digital frame . In order to upgrade your firmware , go to ww . kodak . com / digitalframesupport , choose your product , and then click on downloads and drivers . Once you download the new firmware , you must first unzip it on your computer , then connect your computer with your digital frame with the included USB cable , and transfer the unzipped ` img ' file by dragging and dropping it on your memory card ( which is not included ) inserted in your digital frame . Then it is a simple three step method of going to your frame 's menu , then to ` settings ' , and clicking on ` upgrading the firmware ' . Once the firmware is upgraded , you need to switch off your digital frame , wait 5 seconds , and then turn it back on . You should check every month for a new firmware for your frame and EasyShare software updates for your computer . I noticed a few important improvements once the new firmware was installed . The pictures were clearer ; there were no more any error messages while displaying the pictures , and more of the pictures were displayed when ` fit to screen ' was selected . I highly recommend you check for a firmware upgrade as soon as you receive your digital frame . A unique feature is that you can also communicate wirelessly with your digital frame , allowing you to share your pictures with your home network . This is really a neat feature that is fun , convenient , and just simply cool ! Your digital frame can also access the internet wirelessly and keep its internal clock set to the correct time . This is useful when you set your frame to switch on only at certain times . For example , you can schedule your frame to display pictures only during the day , and automatically turn off at night , only to resume displaying pictures again in the morning at a specific time you determine . This is a unique feature that is energy saving , and will give your frame a longer life than simply keeping it on all the time . As mentioned above , no memory cards are included on which to record your pictures . The digital frame will accept the following memory cards : SD , MS , xD , MMC , CF , and MD . The frame has an internal 128 MB of storage , hardly enough for the savvy photographer . The memory cards need to be formatted first before you record your images on them . I first formatted my Sony SD memory card using NTFS , but my digital frame was unable to read it . This was before I did the firmware upgrade . When I formatted the memory card using FAT32 , the digital frame read my memory card and displayed the pictures . I am not sure whether future firmware upgrades would allow NTFS formatting , but this is not needed . Make sure you format using FAT32 ! Some additional nice features of this digital frame : the possibility of choosing different picture wipes and duration during the slideshow ; brightness control ; ability to print pictures directly from your digital frame ; audio background during picture display ; video display ; and fit to screen feature . This is really a great and very easy to use digital picture frame . It is so nice to watch all my travels , adventures , celebrations , parties , and gatherings that span a period of many years on one digital frame . Time really does fly ! And as your pictures will testify , life is beautiful . Peace and love to everyone , God bless you all , and may you have a long and healthy life preserved in pictures for generations to come to enjoy !  
2	  I 've owned this player for 9 months and it is great . To answer a couple of past reviews - Iomega has update the firmware ( available at their site ) where the shutoff time is now 2 minutes and the playlists are now saved when it shuts down . There are a few other enchancements also ( See update documentation ) . Disks are very durable - but care must be taken when inserting - it must be done exactly with care . Do not force . This player is also a very good audible player for listening to audible books ( audible . com ) - very easy to use . Disks do not hold as much music as more higher memory units but extra disks are easly to cary and also this unit can be used as a drive for the computer - so music files can be easily transfered to the disk through Windows Explorer with no additional music controling program needed .  
2	  A bit large and heavy but excellant construction . Other than that the title says it all  
1	  The Potential1 . Great input / output options ( svhs , rca , firewire . . . ) . 2 . DVD recording from whatever source the unit can take . The Let Down1 . Cumbersome procedures for VHS = > DVD recordings . 2 . Fussy firewire input . 4 . Disk Error on most discs after 5 months of owning the unit . 5 . HORRENDOUS customer service / support .  
1	  Works fine on my XP system . Will not work on my Win 7 system . That 's what I should have learned by reading reviews but didn't read enough before buying . That 's the bottom line and the reason for writing this review . Belkin site tells you nothing that I can find . Guess I 'll stay away from them henceforth .  
2	  If you 're looking for a filter that successfully filters UV light to get those wonderfully contrasted images you might be imagining , you 're better off getting something else . The product description here and on Tiffen 's website can be a bit misleading for someone who doesn't read it carefully , but essentially this filter is just another piece of glass made for protecting the main lens . After a few test images taken against a desk lamp I did find that the filter did produce more glare at * certain * angles BUT for regular shooting in a moderately well lit area it did just as fine as the lens by itself . Ultimately , I did buy this for protection purposes , as I would much rather have this ten dollar-ish filter break than spend $ 400 + to replace my lens if it ever gets scratched . For THIS purpose , this filter is sturdy and sufficient . Nothing special , nothing much to complain about . 4 stars .  
2	  I got this item last week with 6Gb . It 's a great device . It has good display and great features . The * MUSIC * that you want can easily be dragged onto the Sansa . The device automatically gives the playlists of artist , album , etc . The converter that comes with the item is really amazing . It was a big hastle to put videos on my PSP but the converter makes it so easy to put it on the Sansa 270 . You can put pretty much any type of * VIDEO * onto the converter and it will do all the work for you . Im not a big * PHOTO * person but the converter in suposed to be able to do that as well . The * RADIO * can almost always pick up channels very clearly and the recording of the radio is good quality as well . The VOICE RECORDER is very good quality . It is much better than any recorder that comes on a cell phone . The only few bad things about the Sansa e270 is that it does not come with a wall charger or car charger ( i dont think that they even sell them ) You can only charge the device by using the USB cord that it comes with to charge it in your computer . Also the Sansa does not offer a lot of storage space or accessories ( but you can buy extra memory to put in your expansion slot ) I encourage you to buy this great item  
2	  I like this TV Tuner card most because of it 's solid performance and high quality ; that is something that a lot of cards from other no-name manufacturers lack . I know .. I just had a no-name TV Tuner card die on me . ATI has a reputation for reliabilty and good performance in graphics cards , etc . , so this would be a good choice unless you have $ 80 you want to throw away . However , it does work BEST if you have an ATI video card . Otherwise , you may run into some compatibility issues .  
1	  I am sure this is fine for the 1st gen Kindle , which apparently used a standard plug-in which is actually nice . The 2nd , which I have but was not able to tell , cannot use this one . Also not crazy about having to pay twice as much for the 2nd gen one which is proprietary and includes the wall outlet converter , which I did not need .  
1	  I bought this camera for my daughter for her sixth birthday . She is quite familiar with picture taking as she uses my $ 400 Kodak digital camera all the time and takes really good pictures . I figured this would be perfect for her and I wouldn't have to worry about my expensive camera . I should have known that you get what you pay for ! First , there is no screen on the back so you have to wait to see your pictures until you get to a computer . And it only holds 40 pictures . What do we do when we 're on vacation and she 's taking LOTS of pictures ? And then - worst of all , THERE 'S NO FLASH . It 's only good outside and then the pictures are just OK , but good enough for a 6-year-old . I turned on the light right above me - 75 watt bulb - and took a picture of myself and it was dark , you could barely make out my features . Go a few extra bucks and get a good camera that you don't have to replace in a few months because the kids get bored with it ! Now I have to get another one for Christmas for her .  
1	  These ear buds are an inexpensive compromise at getting better quality sound from Ear buttons . The Bass is not very strong . Sound quality is acceptable . However , the lack of a carrying container or pouch , plus the fact that they are poor at eliminating external noise , such as airplane engine noise , makes them a poor choice for air travel .  
1	  was pleased with the cable modem .. it was as stated and pictured . Motorola was one recommended to me and it is working fine .  
2	  Set up was easy , instructions were helpful . Mounted on the dash since the windshield was too far to reach . Love the bluetooth capability that provides for hands-free phone operation with our existing cellphones . Came equipped with all needed accessories .  
1	  This device is terrible are dealing with tree cover , even light tree cover . On certain points on my run , I am in wide open places with a single row of trees far off to one side , and this device loses the signal . When the signal is lost or weak , the device is supposed to interpolate straight line distances between the good reads it gets . Yet , it does not manage to do this properly or consistently . I have three main routes I alternate among-a 10K , a 15K , and a 20K . All three distances have been validated by my bicycle computer , which I was very careful to calibrate precisely . After the 10K , this device loses track of about 500 to 1000 meters , although ocassionally , will be relatively accurate , and obviously the inaccuracy gets worse at higher distances . Because the inaccuracy is not consistent I cannot make adjustments to any of its readings , particularly the pace . One particular section of all three runs is a perfectly straight 2500 meters , but with very heavey tree cover . On some days , despite the poor signal , it measures or interpolates the distance perfectly . On others , it is under by 500 or more meters . This device certainly cannot cut it for any kind of structured training . Inaccuracy is one thing , but it is both inaccurate and inconsistent . Once the leaves begin falling , I am looking forward to some superhuman increases in performance according to this device as my missing kilometers show up again . Since I know the distances already , I do well enough just using this as an over-priced stopwatch , but it would be nice if it could do a decent job of showing my pace . Very frustrating . I am well aware of the limitations of GPS devices having worked with tests of GPS tracking devices on trucks . But this device is off the charts terrible . By comparison , I have a GPS receiver for my Nokia N800 tablet computer that can track where I am going in my house , and I have a lot of trees in the yard . I suppose If you live on a glacier or in the desert , or go really , really slowly , this device would be satisfactory .  
1	  I was not very Pleased with this battery it is about one third as good as a canon battery . It will last until u charge your canon battery . Wayne P.  
2	  Get this product the thing works great ! ..  
1	  The microphone broke after a week . Their tech support is horrible and haven't answered any of my e-mails . I recommend the plantronics dsp-500 .  
2	  I have an old second hand 6210 Officejet printer that has been printing poorly , although the cartridge is not that old . Taking a chance , I ordered this cartridge for it . I installed this today , and it functions perfectly . HP brand , HP packaging , excellent print quality .  
1	  You are better off building your own computer out of parts from the 80 's because that 's basically what you will be getting . Where to start with what is wrong with Dell , customer support ( they will argue with you ) , hardware failure ( if it works right the first time count yourself lucky ) , the motherboard - you get what you pay for remember that , and if you do not upgrade then there will be NO slot available for upgrading later , and the funny thing is that it will work for about four months then the problems start . And as for their printers , RUN don't walk away , RUN far ans fast .  
1	  These earbuds sound pretty good , but they 're kind of a waste of money because no one can actually use this for their phone anymore  
2	  I 've had the JVC Sirius receiver for about 6 months now and have had no problems with it . I like the large screen and the feel of the buttons . Easy to see and use while driving .  
1	  I had high hopes for this MP3 player , given the overall good reviews , but once my music was synced and I had a chance to listen to it , the sound was just awful . It was all crackles and fuzz . I tried listening with high quality ear phones and that didn't change a thing . I ended up returning it and bought a refurbed ipod for the same price .  
2	  Works great , very easy to install ! Saves the expense of another router .  
2	  Worked perfectly out of the box ! no especial steps required . just put it into your device and that 's it !  
1	  This issue was entirely my own doing - I 'm sure the ram itself is fine , but when I searched for " pc2700 sodimm 1gb " this item [ .. ] came up 3rd on the list with only the ram speed as part of the description - it is actually PC2-5300 , not pc2700 . Be wary when searching - not all the results match your searches . I was in a rush , but now have to wait to get the correct part until after my next payday .  
2	  I ordered the Dell keypad replacement , it took 5 days to arrive . It only took 2 minutes to replace . It is identical to the original only this one works ! Thanks for the good price and great product .  
1	  I purchased 2 of these for Christmas presents . Both freeze for no reason while loading music . Rio tech support is totally useless . After 45 minutes they said they knew about an issue with some refubs going out un-checked . I will never buy a Rio product again after this mess .  
2	  Came fast , works good . U3 loads fast and makes it easy to shut down and remove from system . Fast file transfers .  
1	  In a short amount of time working with Sonicwalls , I discovered quite a few issues . I do not recommend Sonicwall as a result . Perhaps the CONS below won't affect you , but at least be aware of them . PROS : Small form factor for UTMCONS : Horrible customer service ( outsourced to India , unless you are certified ) Long wait for customer serviceDynamic DNS client bug that has yet to be resolved ( see below ) No DNS proxy intelligence for Split-Brain / Split horizon setupVery weak DHCP server options , only basicsPoor documentationCustomer Service : First off , understand that level 1 is outsourced to India . I tried opening an incident via their web interface , and after several days without progress , I decided to call . The customer service number I dialed put me on hold right after selecting Tech Support . At some point ( 30 minutes later ) an individual answered , and collected my details , and put me back on hold . About an hour later , the system forced me to leave a message and hung-up . I tried this several times , until I finally did get through to tech support . Now the first person that answers the phone and collects details ( to help route the call ) , fails ( or they lack the mechanism ) to notify the final tech-support person , so you must repeat the details of your case ( I mean seriously , is it terribly difficult to relay such details ? ) . The VOICE quality ( of the call ) is terrible , I imagine they are using VOIP to backhaul calls to India , and using high compression , bandwidth saving techniques which result in low quality ( I specialize in VOIP , and I know what they do to save money ) . This makes life rather difficult when already dealing with heavily accented / overly polite tech support in India . The Dynamic DNS bug is quite simple . If you are getting the Enhanced O / S with the hopes of using dual ISP links ( active / passive ) and plan to use Dynamic DNS to maintain a simple hostname to dynamic ip mapping , you are out of luck . Dynamic DNS client on the Sonicwall is BOUND to the Primary WAN interface ( how stupid is that ? ) . They don't support Split Brain ( aka Split horizon ) DNS , in fact their DNS capabilities are non-existent . The other major players in this field support this , why not Sonicwall ? DHCP - Where to begin ? Its featureless , as weak as you can get it . It supports ( options ) DNS , WINS , Gateway , and a " callmanager " option . Thats it . Poor documentation : I was trying to tunnel all my VPN traffic ( both inbound to lan , and internet ) . Getting this done was difficult , because of non-existent documentation on the subject . You need to add some special NAT rules to support this , but NOWHERE is this indicated . I tried communicating my disappointments to my Sonicwall sales rep , but it seems he can't " do anything about it " . Sonicwall does not listen to customers ( or at least in my size of business ) - simply out of touch . I strongly recommend you consider another vendor ( perhaps one of the top 2 ) , as Sonicwall is out of touch with customers , and have a weak offering overall .

1	  I heard good things about this brand but I was really disappointed with these . They stretched out really quickly so they wouldn't fit on my head very well . Then , after less than 2 months of use , the bass is totally shot . It 's crackly and pretty much ruined . The $ 10 headphones I got at Radio Shack lasted a LOT longer than these . If you 're looking for a good set of durable headphones , keep looking .  
2	  I chose to buy this Cyber Acoustics Portable Digital Docking Speaker for my iPod based on the reviews and I 'm delighted that I did . It 's just what I was looking for . I 'm a moron when it comes to electronics but this little thing is very easy to use and has a fabulous great sound .  
2	  This camera is definitely one of the best point-and-shoot cameras around . I know ' cuz I 've tried 5 other cameras before deciding to keep this one for good . I 've tried the Kodak DX4900 , DX6340 , Minolta S414 , Canon PowerShot S45 , and the Sony DSCP8 . This camera beats all the others I 've tried either in size , weight , ease of use , and / or autofocus ability . Most reviews I read here tells you what 's good about this camera . I think it 's important to list all the negative things about this camera , so you can make a better informed decision . Here goes .. 1 . Short battery life . At full charge , the bundled 840mAH battery last for around 30 pictures ( with LCD screen on ) . Buy a 1000mAh battery .. it last much longer . 2 . Autofocus works 90 % of the time . The other 10 % of the time , you 'll get fuzzy pictures , regardless whether it is inside or outside . I find this acceptable since the other cameras I 've tried only produced well focused pictures 80 % or less of the time . ( The DX4900 produced well focused pictures 99 % of the time ) 3 . Red eye . I get many more red eye pictures with this camera than I do with others . This perhaps has something to do with the fact that the flash is very close to the lens . This is acceptable to me ' cuz I have software that can solve this easily . 4 . 512MB card only gives 308 pictures at 3.2MP and the best quality mode . I was able to get 209 pictures with a 256MB CF card in the DX4900 when set at 4MP and best quality . The math just doesn't add up .. I thought I would get at least 400 pictures with the S230.5 . Battery door easiy pops open . It lacks a battery door lock so you can open the door easily . There is however a lock to keep the battery from falling out . 6 . Zoom is insufficient . 2x zooming is certainly not enough for times zooming is needed . Two cameras I own in the past had 4x zooming and I certainly love to have that in this camera . 7 . Very very close-ups cannot focus at all . I tried taking a picuture of the serial number on my pen and it simply would not focus . I tried that with my DX4900 and it was able to focus on the serial number . 8 . Casing scratches easily . I found a number of visible scratches two days after using it . I tried very hard to handle this well and even bought a case to hold it . But it still is vulnerable to scratching . 9 . Controls and menu options are fairly complicated to use . You really have to read the manual to use this well . All in all , this camera is an excellent camera . I love most of the features on this camera and finds it as a keeper . The other cameras I 've tried cannot match up to this camera . You simply can't go wrong buying this camera . I bought mine .. brand new just last week , so shop around for bargains .  
1	  it holds charge but takes an hour to gain a 1 % battery life . kind of makes it pointless of having a laptop . would of given it a 1 star but at least it keeps my powerbook alive  
2	  You may be wondering ( as I have ) whether the extra price you pay for the Canon brand batteries is worth it . In my opinion it really is for the following reasons . - Dependability : After a full charge you will get a full day worth of shooting without any problems . The battery holds its charge very well-Consistency : Canon batteries last generally the same amount of time every time you charge them fully . Many generic brands have spotty performance ( usually good to start but they go downhill fast ) - No worries : Unlike the generic batteries you won't worry about testing the performance of these batteries , personally I 'd rather be shooting instead of timing ( or worrying about ) the generic battery . And for those who are wondering , this battery works with a number of Canon Digital SLRs . I know for sure that this works with the Canon 5D , 20D and 30D .  
1	  This battery is such a bad fit for the battery port of the photoviewer . The cover bulges out slightly once I was able to fit it in and connect the terminals which I think was poorly designed . Overall , not user-friendly and poorly designed .  
2	  The camera feels good to handle . Not as heavy as it looks . Very attractive looking too ! Start up time is nice and quick . Auto focus is very quick also . And so is the time between taking pictures . The zoom ring is nice and smooth . I like that you can raise your optical zoom up to 21.5X from 12X just by setting the megapixels for each picture takin down to 3 mega pixels instead of 10 . And you can't see a difference if your printing 4x6 pictures . The image stabilizer works great too ! The focus ring takes time to get the hang of . Indoor pictures you 'll wanna use the flash for clearer pictures . If you walk in a totally dark room and take a picture with the flash on it 'll light up the whole room . The pict-bridge works great too on a pict-bridge printer . The LCD is bright & beautiful . It gets brighter the the brighter it gets in the room or outside so you can see it better . All in all this camera is awesome . You can attach lenses to it . The wide angle lens gives you about two more feet on each side and the telephoto lens brings your object about 3 feet closer to you . The video is great too ! You can zoom while taking a video . The only bad thing about this camera is the software it comes with . Besides that though I love it !  
1	  I have trackballs on every computer in the house . They aren't optical like this one , but I wish they were . No more cleaning ! But I can't for the life of me operate this one like the others . I am used to the index finger moving the ball and the thumb doing the clicking , so I am constantly fighting this thing ! Plus my thumb doesn't have the range of motion that my finger does , so it isn't as easy or as quick to move as the other kind ! The part that really gets me though , is that my little finger and ring finger goes to sleep and then I get pins and needles ! Maybe you can get used to it , but I won't ! Will be replacing this thing ASAP .  
2	  does the job , comfortable , good material . Of course , the MX1000 is better but this is a good cheapo .  
2	  Great for your controller . Very comfortable . Works great for when you 've been playing all day , no sweat making the controller slipping out of your hands . Lasts a long time too . :)  
1	  Please tell me if I will ever receive this item . I have waited a month already . I am referring to the adapter for my dx7630 . I have the lens but I cant use it without the adapter . Thanks in advance , Marvin  
2	  I came from using a ( rather disappointing ) JVC model that failed to adjust to light , so I was a little apprehensive when I saw another digital video camera model . I couldn't have been more surprised when I got the package open how sharp and well-lit the picture was . It really is a fabulous little deal for anyone that wants to chronicle their lives .  
1	  Don't waste your money . I have had THREE of these . Yes , I regret it . The first one worked very well and lasted about a year . My computer runs most of our entertainment so the keyboard is used like a remote , but it is also used as a traditional keyboard for web browsing , games , email , etc . . . I use my computer a lot . So I was happy it lasted a year before it started skipping so much that I couldn't use it . I also had to hold it upside down to get the track ball to work . Even with that first one there was the need to re-sync often . That 's a pain , but I figured I couldn't find anything better for as much as I use my keyboard . So we ordered a second one to replace the first when it finally died . I knew immediately that something was different . The second Adesso skipped A LOT . It needed to re-sync A LOT . The track ball was stiff and hard to use . The mouse key in front of the track ball only worked part of the time . Since my first Adesso WKB-3000UB worked so well , I thought we 'd just gotten a bad one . We returned it and ordered a third Adesso . This was by far the worst . It skipped , had to constantly re-sync , but the very worst - the batteries it came with kept exploding ! This caused damage to the keyboard before we figured out what had happened ( not to mention battery acid on my fingers from trying to clean up the mess ) . Again , I thought that it was one bad battery , so I only replaced one and cleaned up everything . Then two more exploded ! I read a lot of reviews on Amazon ( which is how we ended up with this keyboard ) , and I 'm always skeptical of " overly " negative reviews , but please believe me when I say that I wish I hadn't bought this keyboard . I WISH I hadn't wasted that money . The quality may have been good once , but it 's definitely not now . I 'm now using an IOGEAR that was much cheaper , and so far works very well . I haven't had to re-sync once . It 's uses two batteries instead of four , and the USB connector is so small there 's very little chance of bumping it ( unlike the Adesso ) . The only thing I don't like with the IOGEAR is that there 's no mouse button with the track ball , so it will always take both hands , even just to browse the web . I can live with that if it works better than the Adesso WKB-3000UB Wireless Mini Keyboard , and that wouldn't take much .  
1	  Yup , if it wasn't for the ink glitch , I will be giving it better .. Because of it , this product doesn't even deserve to have one star !  
2	  We need to see this waterproof photo paper more readily available here on Amazon ! The photos are beautiful and long lasting .. my photos from 3 years ago are still brillant in color and quality . Great buy and product .  
2	  I purchased this receiver 3 days ago , and finally have it set up tonight . For the price , it is an excellent value , and seems to be fairly user friendly . What isn't user freindly is the users manual that came with it . After spending the last two evenings attempting to set up my system , ( following the instructions from the manual , ) I ended up paying my salesperson to come over and set it up for me . It took him close to an hour and a half ! With that said , I would still recommend the receiver itself ! The sound quality is very good , everything functions as promised , and I especially like the auto callibration setup for he surround sound .  
1	  Simply put - this is the worst scanner I have ever used . The printed / electronic output can not be read most of the time . Can't figure out whether there are software or hardware issues . BUYER BEWARE !  
1	  I have had 2 chargers from US Wireless and both broke for no reason . Go to Ebay and find a charger for much less money .  
1	  My purchase of this cable modem was based on the excellent reviews here and the promised $ 20 rebate . Received it promptly but spent two frustrating weeks trying to register with ATTBI . I first connected it to the sas site as instructed with no luck ; I then called and provided the MAC address and serial number and waited a few more days without success . Finally , I called again and worked with an ATTBI tech who was not able to " see " this cable modem from his end and thought that the cable was defective and not performing to standard ; apparently it connected to " a rogue server " at the time . In addition , Best Data 's charge of $ 7 for technical support and restriction of 15 days from the date of order to obtain rebate for mail order goods made this modem more costly than first thought . I shipped it back and bought the Motorola SB4100 ( now available at this site ) and was able to connect the same day .  
1	  This panasonic DMR-E75S is a nice item , but beware it may only last for about a year before it turns out to be a surprise package and the owner 's manual booklet can be better too . I also must alert you that the customer care center by phone sucks just like a straw , nothing like a recording telling you that the waiting time for your call to get answer is about 55 minutes and will be answer in the order it came in and all that BS . Give it a year or so then it becomes a surprise package .  
1	  We needed new recordable DVDs for recording shows and reviewing all that we found online about JVC products , decided to purchase these DVDs . Unfortunately , even though they are listed as one of the DVDs to use with our Sony , it does not recognize them and since we opened the box , are unable to return them . Hope you have better luck .  
1	  The MetroGuide is NOT compatible with the Garmin StreetpilotII + . I purchased this on reference that other customers who hadbought the Streetpilot II + had bought the metro guide . Go for Roadsand Recreation ! See Garmin FAQs ..  
1	  BAD DISC ERROR - possible fixAfter about 8 months just like the other reviewer it stopped working . I kept getting bad disc error on a new DVD I bought . I tried good discs that worked before but now got the same Bad Disc error . This is not the first time I had problems loading . Previously , unplugging and plugging it in again sometimes corrected the problem . This time after two weeks of Bad Disc errors , I was about to toss it when I decided what the heck , I 'll check inside to see if it 's dirty or something . FIRST I UNPLUGGED THE UNIT.I removed the 6 screws holding the cover . You may have to pull the sides out a bit if it catches to lift it off . With my expertise knowledge . * eyeroll * I nudged the lense mechanism . It apparently slides to read the discs . I plugged the DVD in and loaded a disc again to see what happens . The lense slid under the tray and started reading the disc . I 'll take the elation of dumb luck over the satisfaction calculated knowledge any day ! lolSo hopefully this will last a little longer . But at least I can use it again for now .. I am downrating it to 2 stars solely on the bad disc error . The viewing quality and performance is decent and covered by other reviewers .  
2	  I debated wether or not to buy a small USB stick of 64gig or a new Ducati .. this memory stick won over !  
1	  If there are no terms and conditions to view before you purchace this " service plan " they can pretty much pick and choose when and who they will assist , if they do at all . I just bought a Canon Powershot S80 and called the phone # provided for information regarding this service plan and to put it nicely I will say that I was irritated just from talking with their Q & A ; person . I dont even want to imagine what they would have put me through if I was trying to have my camera fixed . When I was talking to their Q & A ; person , he who sounded annoyed with me at best . I asked some " What If ? " questions .. For instance , I said , " What If my camera got rained on ? " I phrased it that was intentionally . He retorted with " Well , it depends if it was " wear and tear " or " abuse " . The person then went on to say something to the effect of " I dont know who would be the person that would determine whether or not it was wear and tear , but I cant tell you . " Wow , thats a great help .. CLICKI would rather keep my 80 $ , it sounds like a loosely organized scam . If you are thinking about getting this " Parts and services " plan , just flush your 80 $ down the toilet , at least that way you get to see it spin around a few times . Thanks for reading , Matt  
2	  It took me a while to figure out how the strap configured in it 's multiple configurations - but once I did - it 's easy . Only odd thing is there is no internal sleeve / divider for the laptop . Since I keep my 13 " MacPro in a sleeve already - not a horrible issue , but - it 's been an adjustment . I also purchased the skooba cable caseSkooba R750-300 Cable Stable DLX ( Black ) - which has proven invaluable - although a bit pricey . The real test was taking this case on my BMW R1100RS - and this is where the bum bum positioning along with the stabilization strap make this great - it sits right back on the seat - almost like a sissybar - and doesn't shift or move . The weight isn't on my back - so when I 'm riding a distance , it 's comfortable . I like the looks of this bag a lot - but the construction is really first class which is more important . I get the feeling I could load this up with a lot of weight and the straps would all hold fine ( I had my old Triple 5 Soul bag rip a strap at a trade show - had it re-stitched and it lasted 8 years after ) . It 's not an orthodox place to carry your load - but , as a former grunt who used to hump a ruck with a radio , I can tell you that when hiking - having the weight up high makes things easier - but , for riding - the opposite holds true .  
2	  I bought this camera after extensive research and it has lived up to its almost unanimous accolades . It is small but fits nicely in the hand and feels balanced and substantial - not light and cheap . It packs so many features I am still rereading the manual . Flesh tones and white balancing seem very accurate on Auto but everything can be controlled manually if you wish . It seems to use power better than other cameras I 've used ; I can go several days without recharging or replacing my batteries ( Ialways carry a spare , fully charged set ) . The software on the Macintosh is well designed . My daughter and I created a 360 degree QuickTime VR file of our living room in minutes . Canon recently released Mac OS X software and it functions beautifully . So far I could not be more pleased with my purchase .  
2	  Great little DVD player and the price was great ! It works fine and no complaints .  
1	  I already had the network and I would say although I 'm not brilliant , I am pretty computer savy . Forget this thing . It 's so frustrating because it 's such a great idea . I actually had it up and running for a weekend . I kept getting " download error " when I tried upgrading the firmware ( on THREE computers ! ) . But it worked OK without the upgrade . I told myself I could live without playlists .. But now more than 90 % of the time I get " Rhapsody is being accessed by another program " . Doesn't matter how many times I power cycle the computer and Rhapsody . Or I get my other Fave " file format error " . It 's really too bad - I had such high hopes for this .  
1	  This unit seemed like a good purchase due to its small footprint and low price . I purchased two units for my home and have been very disappointed . The first unit never worked properly : many DVDs simply would not play . Others stopped playing partway through , pausing for 10 seconds or more , or entirely locking up the unit ( which required unplugging the power cord to resolve ) . The Second unit worked very well for about six months , although for some reason , this one did not have a volume control like the first one did . I was particularly impressed that such an inexpensive machine was able to re-sync the audio track as needed . However , it started doing the same thing as the first unit - and then it died entirely . Overall , this product has good features , but it fails miserably in the reliability department .  
2	  It did just what I wanted , had no problems . I can take and use it any car , love playin my own music  
2	  We bought these to replace an old pair when we went on vacation . My wifes and my eyes are not what they used to be so we wanted an easy focusing product and these didnt disapoint us . As others have said , the auto focus works great for distances but not up close . If you are a bird wathcher these are not for you . We were able to clearly watch dolphins out in the ocean on our vacation clearly and I use them at home to watch the deer and elk . I would definatly buy these again  
2	  I found the product good . It was almost what I expected . Thanks ! - Mukibul  
1	  I 've had the unit for about a year now , but only paid about $ 50 for it . About six months ago it developed a volume problem . When the unit is first turned it goes to full volume . It will also sometimes turn on all by itself , at full volume , durring a thunderstorm . The sound quality is pretty good though , especially for the price . I like bass , but find the iVoice a little too bass heavy . I usually wind up using the bass reducer function on my iPod . I would have given it 4.5 stars if not for the volume issue .  
2	  My deskjet 960 crapped out after about 4 years , so I needed a new printer . Also , my current living situation is dual-platform - one Mac laptop ( me ; & I do graphic design ) , one PC laptop and one PC desktop - as well as wireless . We needed something that all three computers could work with / print to , and we were hoping to find a wireless printer as well . We were very pleased to find an HP that would fulfill all of those requirements . Set up was fairly easy - as long as you follow the directions ! You have to make sure you set up your wireless network to accept the printer , but again , fairly simple if you follow the directions . ( Don't jump ahead like I did ! ) It is very convenient to set the printer anywhere and just plug it into the wall without worrying about a router or plugging it into a computer . The print quality is very good for color images , even on plain white copy paper . ( I haven't tried printing on better stock , or photo paper , but I assume it would look even better . ) After about a week , I was ready to take the printer back . Some documents just wouldn't print at all and / or would get " stuck " , with all lights blinking on the printer ( typically when trying to print from my design software ) . Also , documents that were over two pages long would just print one page . I was convinced to call HP 's help desk before taking the printer back . David , the tech , was very helpful & knowledgeable about Macs , as well as about the printer ( and ink cartridges ) . To solve the " sticking " issue , go to the HP web site and download the latest driver ( as of today , version 2.7 - the CD that came with the printer had version 2.6 ) . The driver solved the wireless and connectivity issues , and I could print documents regardless of the program . It also seemed to speed up the output . To solve the issue of printing only one page of a multi-page document , go to Page Setup , and change Format for : Any Printer to DeskJet 6800 ; change Paper Size to Letter . In Microsoft Word , you have to change the document template to automatically change the Page Setup , otherwise you will have to manually change it before each document you print . To do that , go to Format > Document . Click the Page Setup Button , and change Format for : Any Printer to DeskJet 6800 ; change Paper Size to Letter . Once you have done that , hit the Default Button . When it asks if you want to change the default settings for the NORMAL template , click YES . ( I haven't figured out how to change this in my design programs , but luckily most of those documents are one page . ) For the money , this is a good printer . I hope it lasts as long as my old printer did ! Note : the reason I only gave this printer four stars is because I haven't had it long enough to know if it will remain consistent over a long period .  
2	  I was very pleased with the quality of the cables . It did take a little longer than I expected to receive them , but it was only a little over a week . The value is great ! WalMart wanted $ 26.00 for a cable of the same quality . You can't beat this deal !  
2	  Don't understand why anyone would pay $ 40 for the same cable just because it 's made by Monster Cable . This is a cable that carries a digital signal so what is Monster claming they do better . I only payed $ 12.99 and it works perfect !  
1	  Have not yet used the color cartridge ; however , my printer will not align properly after inserting the new ? black cartridge . I get a message to remove the tape ( which I had already done ) . I can print , but the result is very light . I am wondering if this was truly a new pack or a refill ?  
2	  I purchased this keyboard about 5 years ago from Amazon . It has stood the test of time and the battery still works great . The little mini mouse pad is kind of useless , but the keyboard is great . It is very slim and sleek on my desk . The charging stand really makes this a nice addition to the office , because I can put in on the stand out of the way to use the desk space .  
2	  This product is exactly as I expected . Ilford products are very reliable , and this arrived in a timely fashion and undamaged .  
1	  The Cokin 77mm Z series adapter ring works fantastically as advertised , and as the previous review said it does screw on and off very easily . It is solid , does its job of holding the filter holder on , etc .. The problem comes when you take a photo of something bright ( which is pretty much what these things are for ) and you get a burry white arc from the reflection of the text " COKIN - 77 - th 0.75 - FRANCE " that is painted on the outside of the adapter . The only way to fix this is to paint over it , which is what I intend to do today . If I wanted DIY , I would 've done it myself , so instead of rating 5 stars , I 'm rating 2 stars . I 'll rate 5 if they ever fix this and send me one that doesn't have the problem .  
2	  My husband and I bought this TV a little over 5 months ago and it fantastic . The picture is crisp and clean . No dead pixels . No glare problems . Easy to hang on the wall with a standard wall mount . We didn't expect anything from the Ambilight feature , but I must admit it makes watching TV easier on your eyes . It can be turned off if you do not like it . There are plenty of inputs for your gaming systems , etc . PS3 games and Blu-ray both look outstanding .  
2	  The picture quality is excellent . Only problem so far has been photographing children playing in a gymnasium with no flash . Even " Kids and Pets " setting can keep this sharp .  
2	  Had this now for quite a long time and it 's still holding up . Can't really complain about it , plenty of plug inputs and the labels are nice . Outside of that it 's probably a little more than I would spend on another power strip , but for my main entertainment center I figured " why not "  
2	  These little speakers are packed with sound ! The bass on this thing is amazing ; if you 're looking for impressive speakers with great sound quality I would highly recommend them . You can also plug them into your TV and use that for a nice set of speakers which is a plus . I am truly blown away by the quality you get from these . You can't go wrong with BOSE . I was hesitant at first since it was so pricey but after reading several reviews I finally decided to purchase them and try them out . The only negative thing I could say about this item is the pricing and the lack of on / off switch . Other than that it 's a good buy .  
2	  this is a great router . set up did require a call to dlink but was effortless - they were around at 1 in the morning and the call only took about 8 minutes . our laptop sure seems accessing the the internet quicker . it has not failed in 3 weeks of use like our old router used to . one the coolest features is the usb port so you can create a wireless printer network with any printer . 2 thumbs up overall .  
1	  Keyboard lighting not bright enough to show through the letters unless very dark in the room . Two of the keys already failing after a few months . Not worth the money .. choose another brand .  
2	  Product was packaged well and arrived quickly . My order was even shipped free , what more could you ask for ?  
2	  You need this , only if you don't have a pole already , or to mount your antenna anywhere . If flush to a wall the antenna sits straight , or flat if you will .  
2	  The inks work just as well as the Canon brand inks . I will continue to purchase .  
2	  I do a lot of printing and was tired of paying " color print " prices for a lot of text printing so I ordered the HP Laserjet 1018 printer . I have been extremely pleased with the quality of the print and the speed of the printer . The pages do curl when they first come out of the printer but I expected this . If you lay them flat and wait until they cool , they do flatten out . This has been NO PROBLEM for me . I have owned the printer for three months and have not replaced the cartridge , and I do a LOT of printing for a class I teach . I did find that I have printer problems if I have both my color and laser jet printer turned on at the same time . The problem was solved by leaving the printers turned off until I get ready to print and not having the printers in the " on " position simultaneously . The title says it all - I love this printer .  
2	  no complaints .. they are wires .. i think my son uses these things .. i can't even remember why i purchased them ..  
2	  This is a top quality product , but it was overkill for my needs . ( It was a gift ) My particular camera setup is really too small for this head . Additionally this head is rather bulky compared to a ball head , so portability is reduced . That said it performs beautifully with more features than most folks might ever use . It has been quite useful when I needed a steady and accurate shot . My only complaint about this head , other than the bulk , is that the release is not as easy as it could be . It took a lot of practice before I got the trick of quickly releasing the camera from the head . In the meantime I lost a few shots while fumbling to change lenses , batteries , etc .  
1	  I cannot print out even 10 pages without jams .. just terrible .  
1	  I love SIRUS and the S50 is great when it works but has so many problems . The system is very dependent on software . The upgrades fix one problem and but create a new problem . In particular , since the 3.15 software update , just about every unit it was downloaded to has got the dreded " No Signal " problem . Technical supoort says nothing can be done until the next firmware update in 2 months - I would recommend no one buy for 2 months until the problem is fixed .  
1	  These are the worst sounding earbuds that I have ever put in my ears that cost over USD2.99I mean , they really sound cheap and juvenile . I really feel cheated and would never purchase this product again .  
2	  this is a great buy . bought this for my son and he loves it . will buy another one . good value and durable . just as advertised .  
1	  I always wanted to buy this machine . But it was a disappointment in time to see the photos . She has no differential photos to the light of day and night at times the flash is not triggered . Not when the picture comes out with the filter that you chose . I did not like and do not recommend . If you are looking for a fun buy the camera fisheye that you will not regret if  
2	  I love this CD player .. except the headphones are jumpy at times .. staticy like . Depends if you hit them or something .. the radio reception is great , clear sounding . The CD player is awesome ! It has a great sound . In my opinion , this is a great product !  
1	  I don't recommend this product to anyone . It is easy to use , however , the sound is horrible . It is noisy and has a loud humming sound to the finished CD . Also , the background is horrible . The first one I bought I returned because I couldn't even hear the songs on the CD . the second one is a tiny bit better , but it still very disappointing . I am not planning on using it much . I haven't even tried the cassette player yet . It has one thing for it . The cabinet is pretty ! DON " T BUY IT !  
2	  The 2nd remote worked great right out of the box . I just entered my components into the harmony software and it did the rest . The first remote i got the volume up and channel down didn't work . Harmony sent me a new remote and everything was taken care of .  
2	  This eyepiece filter is ideal for moon viewing . It works very well with aCelestron 93230 8 to 24mm 1.25 Zoom Eyepiece . The polarizing filter can be tightened in the eyepiece holder and then the eyepiece tightened in the filter . This allows twisting the eyepiece to zoom and sliding the lever to adjust the brightness . A basic moon filter cuts down on the intensity but require extra effort to attach and detach it . The Orion 1.25 " Variable Polarizing Filter for Telescope Eyepieces is popular but also requires additional steps to attach and detach it . The Meade filter is much quicker to install and remove . It also works for terrestrial viewing : reducing glare and reducing overly bright scenes .  
2	  Very pleased with this Canon product . However I don't think I should have been charged sales tax seeing how this item came from New Jersey .  
1	  My daughter bought this camera and found that it took very blurry video and the photos were blurry as well . There does not appear to be any autofocus as you would find on a digital camera and the flash photos appear to leave the subject washed out and looking blue . About the only good pictures are those taken outside in bright light .  
1	  When I first subscribed to SBC / Yahoo DSL , this was the modem that shipped with it . I was connected at 100 Mbps , but was only surfacing a download speed that maxed out at just above 20 KB / s . I checked my computer for anything that would slow it down , but nothing . I called AT & T and they said the ping was fine and modems don't affect speed . I recently changed over to the Motorola SB5120 Surfboard Modem , and my download speed spiked to about 300 KB / s . Same thing with my friend except even lower speeds .  
1	  Feels good , sounds good but the mic broke after < 3 months of use . Not impressed . The logitech is $ 20 cheaper and is better since it is digital and uses USB , however it is not as comfortable as the Sennheiser .  
2	  Arrived quickly and works well for what it is .. a doggone long printer cable ! I would recommend it .  
2	  For this price I thought it was an off-brand equivalent battery . But it is exactly the same as the one that came with my camera . My camera is a Sony DSC-HX1 and this is the battery for this camera . It sounds like this battery works with other devices as well .  
2	  Wow . Let me tell you , this is the best thing since emo . It 's a wonderful thing to store ten to twenty CDs ( depending on the bitrate ) onto one CD that you can take anywhere . Think about this :> > The unit is stylish and the screen is easy to read . >> It does work with every mp3 CD that I 've put into it . >> .. it is an amazing bargin . >> You can take your whole music collection with you where ever you go on about seven CDs . >> It simply does not skip . Whatever you do , even with regular CDs , no skipping . I was throwing it across my room and there was no skipping . NO SKIPPING ! >> You can organize your music into folders and play only the foloder that you want to . >> MP3 's play without the CD even moving . Crazy . There are some things that you have to know about the player though :> > The controls are a bit hard to get used to , but a little practice and you can search your whole database of music . >> Multisession CDs cannot be played , but you can store some songs onto a CD-RW , play them , erase them when you 're finished and write new ones onto it . >> The headphones it comes with are [ bad ] . But that 's it ! I have no idea what these other reviewers are talking about .  
2	  Just bought this MP3 player for my son for his 7th birthday . His older sister has the 1 GB model . He loves it and holds more than enough songs for him , considering his age . Easy , never asks how to do anything and keeps him busy for any car trips . I guess the only complaint I would have is the singing we hear coming from the backseat !  
1	  Not only is this thing all plastic with FIXED levers that are merely decorative , if you look at the product image carefully you 'll see a HUGE black plastic black box on the back of it which even kills the cuteness factor of it . My 35mm Minox at least fit in my pocket , when the lens was folded shut .  
2	  I 've had good experinces with this one so I also ordered this 5 pack for everyone in my group . I had a really old Kensington camera which worked only with Win 95/98 and after few years I decided to use a webcam for general conference calls and for fun too . I basically compared this model with Creative labs Webcam NX Ultra and found this model has had lot of upgrades and been on the market for quite sometime . So I went ahead anh bought it . - Very easy to setup - have used with windows messenger and MSN messenger - software for video and picture recordings - good microphone quality - I like the Face Track feature where the camera follows the face and zooms in accordingly . You need to have it on the zoom in mode so that it can pan automatically with in the field of sight . I 've used this for many conference calls within US and outside US also . Really worth the value and friends also like the quality of audio / video with the chat . It does come with the flat panel clip as advertised in the product and I 've never seen the other error about " imgstud . exe " as " Mary Foster Cox " suggested .  
1	  Bought the nextar Q3 gps for our vacation this summer . Took it out of the box charged the battery . Put it in the car hook up dc cord only to find out 3 hours later when the battery went dead the dc cord wasn't working . Called customer service they promised to send new cord in 7 to 10 days . Three times they promised to send a cord and on the fourth try they wanted me to buy one . I will never buy another nextar product nor should anyone else . The customer service is terrible they have no problem lying to their customers . I hope it not too late return it too the store  
2	  I bought this frame for my mother-in-law to have with her so we could push photos of my daughter to her . This is done over the wi-fi , as kodak lets the frame pull photos from an online gallery that we can upload pictures to . Note however that I have seen this frame freeze up ( just while being on and doing its thing ) , and thus needing a power off power on cycle ( no need to unplug , as there is a switch ) . For the price , feature packed !  
2	  Able to collapse , not VERY small but certainly moderately easy to carry onboard . Sound quality good , not much noise leakage ( someone sitting * right * next to you might know you 're listening to something ) . Ear cushioning soft , comfortable to wear ( much better than the cheap earbuds that came with my Rio ) . Music quality good .. at least , quite good for using for travel , and helps keep noise out too .  
1	  This item took up so much space . It made my tv look so much smaller than it already is . Reception didn't get that much better even if I placed it close to the window or other spots in my room . I 'd suggest you get a regular rabbit ears antenna .  
2	  I have all but worn out the letters on this board and it still works flawless . I recently upgraded to the later , version II . THe latter one has improved keyswitches over the first rev . The first rev required just a tad more force to down the key . The key feel is very smooth on mine and sometimes , I can't feel home position . Other than these minor issues , this is the best keyboard for accuracy and speed that I have used . Both versions are very good although , I do like the USB II as the keys do not have as much side to side play and are a tad less springy feeling .  
2	  i USED TO HAVE A SALAD SHOOTER AND COULD NOT FIND ONE IN A STORE . i AM GLAD YOU HAD ONE . THEY ARE GREAT AND EASY !  
1	  Though the sound quality of these headphones is not bad at all , the comfort factor leaves a lot to be desired . The buttons for adjusting the headphones to your head size do not work . The headband is extremely flimsy and catches on hair . And I ended my first day using these with a massive headache because they were just too tight and could not be adjusted for proper fitting . Koss - back to the drawing board .  
2	  I purchased this for my husband as a Christmas gift .. and now we fight over who 's car it will be kept in ! We just love it .. and recently took it on a trip with us to Florida . Being in unknown territory , it worked like a charm ! Getting us to and from the airport with ease , plus all the little side trips and restaurants during our stay were a breeze . The only thing we didn't get was the leather case for carrying , which I found out from a friend , was available for this unit . I would recommend getting that if available .  
1	  This turns out to be nothing more than a VERY expensive stamp machine ! At 13 cents EXTRA per stamp , when you factor in the cost of the labels , it is a total waste of money . I would rather run to the post office and use the stamp machine to buy 100 stamps and save 13 bucks . There is never a line at the stamp machine so it is no big deal . As for shipping labels , you can only ship items under 1 pound UNLESS of course you join one of their monthly premium plans or a minimum of $ 10 a month . So basically you end up paying just as much or more than you would with a postage meter . I personally will be returning this back to the store .  
2	  I bought this new , over 3yrs ago , for around $ 69 , and it has served me quite well . I don't need to do a great deal of faxing , but it does the job , prints fine ( I don't use it to print pics ) , copies great , & scans ok , too . I order replacement ink from a third party company , saving almost 80 % from the retail cost , and it 's been fine , too . All in all , I couldn't much ask for anything more . If I did a tremendous amount of printing , I 'd probably go laser , & I wanted to print lots of pics , I 'd most certainly step up to something else , but for what this unit does , I 'm quite satisfied . And when I 've had any questions , they have been very good about support ..  
2	  Got the camera . The neat thing is it comes with everything . The carrying case , ( .. ) and straps . I go the camera and was amazed by the features and things it could do . Great buy !  
2	  these little ear phones are very good i think are the best out there for the price , nice sound and comfortable  
2	  I 'm in two minds about this product . The USB2 is great though the positioning is a bit suspect as i find that the cable for whatever I plug in tends to naturally lie across the keys . The extra symbols are great but can make it look like a spider has crawled across it , stopping the primary letters from standing out . The key action is why I dropped a star . I was using a Macally Icekey ( scissor / laptop action ) that was great but it failed after a few months . I just find the key travel long and the resistance uncomfortable , maybe I 'll get used to it . So , in summary , a nice keyboard but would be improved with scissor action .  
2	  After comparing prices , on-line and locally , I purchased the Polaroid pdv-700 portable dvd player at my local Best Buy store and am very pleased with the quality and the simplicity of the unit-I initially bought it to keep me occupied during a plane trip , but after trying it out a few days ago , I can see that I will be using it at home also-there are several other lesser brands out there , but I prefer to go with a brand name , and since I do own other items that are Polaroid , this was an easy and good decisionfor me to make .  
1	  I bought this camera 1 week ago , I am still trying to figure out how to use it . The viewing menu is so small I can hardly read it , even with glasses on . I had three people trying to help me figure it out and couldn't do it . I am in the process of trying to understand the manual , that is very hard to do , it is no easy to read . I bought this camera because it was supposed to be a simple point and shoot , not so , there are more instructions to read and understand than anything I have ever bought . I tried to return it but couldn't because I opened the package , how else would I know its complicated and impossible to use ? so I am stuck with this thing and I have not been able to take one picture . If you want a simple camera , forget this one . Stick to a company that just makes cameras .  
1	  This unit worked once and never again . I had to resort to downloading pictures from my Nikon directly instead of saving battery time as I had hoped to do . The card reader not only did not work but caused my computer to crash twice , since I , believing the other reviews , kept trying thinking I had the faulty parts , not the reader . I 'm not sure I even want to try another unit .  
1	  I purchased this to make it easier to listen to my tunes while cutting the lawn . The cheap plastic peice broke , so I replaced it with a LARGE keyring ring . To bad they didnt use a . 05 cent peice of metal instead of the crappy plastic part in the first place . Works great now .  
2	  These have great sound and don't fall off my ears when running . They 're exactly what I was looking for . I would buy them again .  
1	  I 'm a faithful fan of Marantz and have been using them for almost 15 years now for my home stereo equipment ( - speakers ) . The Marantz DV6500 Universal Player for years before upgrading to the newer DV 6001 one for the HDMI technology since I purchased the Marantz SR7002 THE Best Reciever they make . Or HIGHEST GRADE with THX , HDCD , DolbyTrue HD , SRS , and of course DTS among other features . The receiver sounds better than the last but the Player has drop outs when watching TV shows ! It was In the shop 3 times , so for weeks no player . They lost my replacement In the mail and took Into the eigth week to finally get a replacement . IN THE MEANTIME I WAS LUCKY TO ROB MY BEDROOM OF A SONY $ 99.99 player upconverter to use so for 8 weeks the Sony played perfectly . So It 's not my HDMI cable or any other trouble . It 's just not . But now the replacement player IS having DROP OUTS ! Now what do I do ? Yes when working It blows away any competition by far has a phenominal picture ABSOLUTELY AS GOOD AS THE SONY UPCONVERTER ! AND SOUND like you never thought It was going to be . NOTHING COMPARES ! BUT WHAT GOOD IS IT WITH DROP OUTS . Note Drop Outs never with music CD 's only DVD 's . IS THIS GOING TO BE THE START OF 3 MORE REPAIR TRIPS ? NOW THEY WANT TO SEE THE DISCS I 'M PLAYING ? IF I HAD ANY DOUBT IT MAY BE THE DISK don't think I tried that ? But I can tell them they won't get through 2 episodes without a drop out . Who knows If they got that kind of time . Or will they try tell me to go away this time ? 2 lemons unlikely . So I say a design flaw . Don't want to leave marantz maybe get the 5001 . But the store has to give me some kind of credit for mine . I will be going with lower priced models from now on ! As long as it has DTS It 's fine . I have the Marantz SR4002 receiver In my bedroom and It Is fantastic . With DTS . MY ADVICE STICK WITH THE DV 4001 or 3001 and save some money ! This Is a edit addition on 7/10/09I had to hook this up using an optical cable & a tri color cable for picture and sound , to get this to play with no drop outs . Now I have the Marantz SR4002 Receiver In my other room and a Marantz DV4001 for use with It . I 'm having more connection problems . The players remote will not work until warmed up 15 to 20 minutes . I had the PLAYER REPLACED and the new one does the same thing ! Marantz what 's up ? 2 Different Receivers and 2 different players ALL MARANTZ yet each set hasbig connection problems . Your own receivers are having trouble playing your players . Each time I tried a new player but the problems stay the same ? Never thought I 'd think of leaving . I 'd change players before receivers . In fact I hooked a Blu Ray up and that plays fine . Just the Marantz through Marantz has problems .  
2	  I love mine and I 've had it for 5 years and it still works beautifully . But .. I don't use the CD function . I bought it because it has all the other features I wanted that I couldn't fine in a non-CD alarm clock at the time of purchase . 1 . Gradual wake2 . Dual alarm settings3 . Nap function of 2hrsMy cons : 1 . buttons are very small and it 's not easy for a new user to quickly hit the off button . Of course alarms have a way of quickly motivating the user to learn with deadly accuracy ! 2 . the motorized CD tray is loud and slow to think . I 'm not surprised about all the other reviews complaining about it lasting if you actually use it daily as an alarm .  
2	  This $ 20 pair of headphones pretends to be a $ 80 pair , but doesn't quite live up to it . it puffs itself up sound - and design-wise , ( putting a lot of emphasis on the bass ) , while both is a bit flimsy . but , hey , these only cost $ 20 . The crisp , punshy bass has been annoying me in rock tracks with a lot of emphasis on bass to begin with , while interestingly they works better with jazz and classical . So yes , this is a good set , and if you are listening to mp3s ( which I will to with these at work ) you are fine . I had hoped for something a little less puffed up , more solid , but am not regretting buying these .  
1	  When I first received the Kodak SV-811 Picture Frame it looked as though it was just a good product , but it needs some improvement before I 'd advise anyone to buy one . Shortly after buying this 8 " frame from Kodak , I returned to Amazon and bought the 10.2 " Opteka Picture Frame , one that put the Kodak totally out of the running . The Kodak has only a brightness control for its ' photos , it needs also to have a contrast control over the frame . It 's like only having one control on your TV for picture brightness and depth , hopefully down the road Kodak will repair this oversight . The format of 800x480 ( 300dpi ) for photos should allow around 500 photos to be stored on the internal memory of this frame . After only 200 photos my frame locked up and wouldn't let any more be installed . Another feature the Opteka frame offers , much nicer in my opinion , is the random showing of the photos . On Thanksgiving day I set the Opteka up in our dining room , and the Kodak in our family room , only the children looked at the Kodak . People were so impressed with the Opteka 10.2 Digital photo frame that 3 of them went out on Black Friday to buy one for themselves ! My best friend who bought the Kodak at the same time as I did , spent his day trying to exchange the frames . Sorry Kodak , you should buy one of the Opteka frames and see what your lacking !  
2	  I just got this as a gift .. it was on my wishlist . I put it there because the product description said that it fits most mobile phones .. well , not mine . I have an LG Voyager . So before you buy , check what size plug your phone accepts . You may wind up buying an adapter like I just did . BTW , I did try it on my cordless phone and it works just fine . I 'll modify this review after the adapter arrives .  
1	  While the headphones are very cool looking and fit so well you forget about them , they suffer in sound quality . When I first tried them , I was surprised at how tinny and treble heavy they sounded . Wondering if I was just used to my stereo speakers , I popped on my standard Apple headphone . Bam - the bass was back . I 'd imagine they 'd be good for running as they do fit snugly , but buyer beware . Cool looks , comfortable fit but not so good sound quality .  
2	  The product is very good . I did not have any problem using the product . A very good purchase for its price .  
2	  This card works with the LG VX8600 mobile phone . No extra steps or anything needed , just put it in and ready to sync up music with computer .  
2	  The DV4500 is hands down the best money I have ever spent ! It has been trouble free and easy to use . Recording video and taking pictures is a one touch operation , and I love being able to take my MP3 's with me without a separate player . Using it on Windows XP is also as simple . I can even transfer the pics and video to my Mac . I read the review from the Guest in Norfolk . I beg to differ . Aiptek does not need to USB 1.1 Drivers on XP ! Windows provides the drivers . You only need drivers for the webcam mode to work . Check out $U$ for some help if you need it . Thanks for another sensational gadget Aiptek !  
2	  About two months ago , after buying a new LG LCD TV , I asked around at a ( n ) ( automotive , of all things ) discussion forum about a universal remote for my entertainment system . The Harmony line was mentioned , with the majority of the users having great things to say about it . I told the wife about it , and she ultimately passed the word to my parents for my Christmas gift . I must say that this was the best surprise gift i have received in a while . The minute we got home , I got started with it . I collected the device info from my components , loaded the program into my PC and started customizing the remote . It 's being used to control my TV , HD DVR cable box , DVD , PS2 , and A / V Center .. and surprisingly it had info on all of these devices . It said it would , but i didn't believe them . Unfortunately , through no fault of its own , it cannot operate my new PS3 ( which uses Bluetooth technology for communication ) . This thing is awesome . If i want to watch TV , with the push of one button , it will turn on the TV , HD DVR and A / V receiver , while changing the output mode on the receiver to what i programmed it to be . If i want to watch a DVD , it will Turn OFF the DVR , while turning on the DVD and leaving the TV on ( with DVD input ) , and again changing the listening mode on the receiver . On and on it goes .. this does it ALL ! I even have it set for my bedroom entertainment center , just in case we lose the remote back there , LOL . The only problem i 've had so far is that it didn't provide full functionality while using the receiver in AM / FM Tuner mode . It provides buttons for Last Preset , Next Preset and Mode .. but they don't work . I am going to try to get it to " Learn " the commands i need it to when i get the time . It 's also possible i didn't set something right . This unit is definitely worth the money . Now , i can actually put the other 6 or so remotes to bed , permanently !  
2	  IMO , the Audigy by Creative is far better than on board audio of an Asus M4A78-E motherboard . Works great with Windows 7 .  
2	  I have both the HP TC1100 and a Toshiba M400 Tablet PC 's but I really don't like the included stylus with either for drawing or writing . The Cross Executive Pen has the hallmark weight and solid feel of a decent ink pen with nice nubs that foster a more natural drawing or note-taking session . I 'm very fond of the pens button design because , unlike the HP 's default stylus , there is rarely an accidental press that disrupts the state of concentration one falls into when drawing . As many have mentioned , the cap option should be avoided because the cap tends to be tight enough that you can literally break the stylus when removing . There is also the issue of why someone needs a cap on a stylus since you have no cause to worry about dried ink ..  
2	  I got these not to long ago and at first I was not sure weather or not I liked them because they don't go as loud as some other In Ear Headphones I have tried . After listening to them for awhile I came to the conclusion It 's not how loud they will go but It 's the sound quality that counts . They are very Crisp , Clear , and precise in the sound that comes through them . Although with any good listening device such as a Apple IPod you will have to adjust your sound settings from time to time because different songs play different and you will need to set your Equalizer settings on your Apple IPod or MP3 player I prefer an Apple IPod because they sound a whole lot better than a MP3 player . Anyway to get a better sound for that particular song and to get the maximum sound quality out of your Monster Turbine In ear headphones you will need to play around with the adjustments on your Equalizer settings on your IPod or MP3 player . So good luck with your Monster Turbines and enjoy your music to all you music lovers out there .  
1	  I so wanted HP to satisfy me-I like the company and hoped it would be a great laptop . However I have been repeatedly so disappointed that I decided to never again buy an HP computer-and I buy one a year . the computer does strange things for no reason .. and example is the common problem among HP users : the CapsLock key constantly " sticks " and can't be unstuck without rebooting , among other strange happenings . HP Customer service is so bad I simply decided to forget them and never buy HP again . It is too bad-this was once a great company .. I hope for their resurrection some day to half their once-great status . I was cheering for them , but all they did was disappoint me .  
2	  I received the product promptly . I purchased it to replace my 1995 Marble Mouse . The new one works as great as the old one except it has a wheel in the middle instead of another button . You can program the wheel to do different operations . I use it for scrolling . The nice thing about the new one is that you do not have to remove the ball to clean the circuits . It does it automatically .  
2	  All the colours line up to my stereo ( CDXGT565UP ) and the only reason it doesnt get a 5/5 is the fact that I still have to figure out how to hook up the power wire to my stock power antenna ( all Vibes / Matrix 's will have this issue ) . Not a large concern though , as I found the power antenna wire very close to the antenna itself . I hope to simply hook up the power antenna wire to a ACC POWER wire , and all will be ok .  
2	  I don't know what kind of scale the other reviewers were using , but this wire easily meets AWG standards for 8 gauge , and the thick insulation is a plus in my books . Do the math yourself , a cross section of this wire ( including insulation ) is 9mm and the copper part is just over 3mm ( AWG standard for 8 Gauge wire is 3.2mm ) If you need some 8 gauge wire i would highly recommend this .  
2	  I actually bought this for my iPod after the fact to extend my coverage with apple . For just a couple bucks more than you are going to pay to ship your iPod back to Apple , I extended my coverage for another year . In the end , I got a brand new iPod . I was very pleased .  
1	  I do not recommend this toner cartridge . I 've printed less than 200 pages and the ink is starting to fade . I have to take out the cartridge and shake it for every 5-6 pages I print .  
1	  Sony has been my preferred brand for years , but this product has been a disappointment . I recently purchased several of these for our house , and of the four I purchased , 2 had CD players which did not work . I so trust Sony that I assumed that I had had a technological brain freeze and it was my error . But , the CD players simply do not work . Of course , since I trust Sony so much I had disgarded the packaging . The radio / time functions work great , but still an expensive lesson .  
2	  I received the Scarlet Red Bodysuit and the Jet Black Bodysuit for Kindle Fire in the same order , along with a Boxwave stylus . All at a discount , on sale and the offer for the stylus had a discount for the Bodysuit . Under $ 13.00 for all three . Free shipping , because the original cost added up to the minimum $ 25.00 with Amazon , pre-discounts . I thought I got a terrific deal ! The cover slips right onto my Fire with little effort , like jelly shoes for the Fire . The edge designs on the back are grippy , while the center of the back is smooth . On the face side of things , the Bodysuit just goes around the edge , so you see the full face of the Fire , which is why I wanted the covers . The top has speaker cutouts and the bottom has the cutout to allow for charging and earphones , along with the on-off button . I chose two colors because of the great deal and I like change every now and then . The Scarlet Red is kind of jelly clear , in the way you can see through it a little . Mine is not the dark red that it looks on my Mac . Kind of more a Candy Apple Red . Still , cute and femme . The Jet Black is solid when held up to light . The grippy edges are a matte black , with the center of the back is a glossy patent kind of look . I would suggest a screen protector to go with the Bodysuit . And maybe a slip case for a little buffer if you tote your Fire around like I do . I do have a cover that is more " book " style , but it does not give me the realty I want for the face surface . The Bodysuit adds a little coverage in a slim , sleek sort of way . I am not sure how much " drop protection " the Kindle Fire would have , with hopes I don't find out . I am pleased with my purchases and I hope my review helps someone with their Kindle Fire needs .  
1	  I 've gone through many different sets of headphones as a runner and I 'm always looking for some that are comfortable , stay in my ear , and don't break . I 've never found a set that meets all three criteria . These phones have pretty decent sound , but did not stay in my ear very well , especially once I started sweating . The phones would sit in my ear okay , but if I wanted really good sound I would have to push down on the bud into my eardrum and instantly it would sound twice as good / loud . After I would start to sweat , the buds would gradually get looser and move farther from my ear drum . On really long runs they would even pop out of my ear completely . In addition to the eardrum fit , I did not like the way they fit over the head . I would have to adjust the phones and tighten them at least once a mile , and I couldn't wear a cap or head covering in the winter with these as they 're too stiff to put anything over . The cord from the phones is pretty bad too , as it twists into itself just slightly and is never truly straight . Finally , I don't know what the Sweat Guard Mechanism is for because the functionality of these phones drops 50 % at least once I started sweating . And like every pair of phones I 've had , they went mono and the left phone eventually stopped working , almost surely because it was ruined by sweat . I would have given these phones 2 stars because , despite how cheap they are , they did last me around 200 miles of use , which is more than most phones last me , but I have to give it 1 because they specifically advertise it in a way that makes you think it is " sweat-proof , " but I can almost guarantee you if you sweat enough these phones will eventually succumb to it , just like pretty much every sport headphone on the market today .  
2	  Ive had this cable to connect my hd receiver to tv for about a month with no problems . I went on cnets recommendation that you shouldnt spend more than 10 bucks on a cable and the fact that these appear to be the best selling ones on amazon . Well I plugged them in and it works great so no complaints here . I guess Id have to go buy a more expensive one to see what I could be missing out on but my picture with these is great .  
1	  Thanks to all of you who wrote reviews ! . I will not invest in this latest generation of iPod . They need to improve on a number of flaws mentioned !  
1	  = REVIEW UPDATE - Nov 13 2007 - Linksys released on Oct . 30 2007 a new firmware ( ver 1.01.13 ) . I updated the router immediately , and after 15 days I could say that I noticed much more system stability . Configuration interface has been deeply modified also to implement new functionalities ( like IP address pre-assignation ) . Many bugs has been fixed , some still exists . Menues are still confusing sometimes and help text have to been improved . Wish that these matter will be kept in consideration for next firmware release . Wireless seems to be more stable even if performances are not 100 % as expected . This product has been greatly improved , but still Linksyshave to do some work to release a better firmware version . = PREVIOUS REVIEW - June 28 2007 - After one week of testing in my home network in conjunctoin with LinkSys AM200 ADSL modem I would like to report this way : Firmware version : 1.00.13PROS : Good firewall performances , uptime , gigabit switch , nice looking , excellent phone technical support , tiny wall AC adapter . CONS : Very poor and instable Wireless " G " performances , dramatic Wireless area reduction in comparison with my old D-LINK , impossible to preassign IP addresses , high-pitched continuous noise , limited MAC filtering ( just 20 entries ) , heat , web interface hangs , front LEDs are useless if you don't watch them just in front , web interface sometime confusing or - at least - not clear . This is sold as a " professional " WiFi router , so customers are expectingadequate performances . I wish that serious guys like Linksys will suddenly fix the major cons , WiFi " G " performances and IP pre-assign in particular . Otherwise a much cheaper " home " product will work absolutely better at one third of the cost .  
1	  Memory is supposed to be 2 gig but runs at 1 gig . Not sure how this can be but it is .  
1	  I bought these for my small kids to listen to movies on the plane . They don't care much for earbuds . The sound on these old things are horrible . Keeping in mind that the plane can be hard on the ears for sound qulaity . You get what you pay for . :)  
2	  This is my first apple product in 10 years and it is truly a work of wonder , beautifully designed and works perfectly , no one should be without one . I got it yesterday and I am all smiles today , imagine having your whole CD collection in this tiny device . Be warned that the PC version does not automatically sync up when you connect to the USB port , you have to click on the Sync button in musicmatch .  
2	  How can I praise more about this item ? It 's awesome ! Get one if you don't have one , yet .  
2	  It 's a good piece of equipment . It 's fairly well sized and does the job as specified . I noticed it introduced noice onto my PC speakers when switched to headset .. Not too loud and no big issue in my case .  
2	  I am a Professional Video editor with very demanding needs for my drives . After burning through two very dissapointing HP drives ; I decided to go with this one . Works Great . Haven't used the double layer feture . * This is the Worlds First 18x DVDRW Drive * Pros : I have burned around 100 dvd 's , never once had to clean the drive . Very fast burner , great quality and very reliable . Cons : The Software takes too much memory and processing power to run ( even while running in the background ) , for a DVD burner . I recommend to disable the " Boot-Up Start " and only use the software for limited amounts of time to keep your computer running up to speed . Overall , I would recommend this drive to almost anybody looking for a fast and reliable drive .  
1	  I received this laptop as a graduation gift . I would have never chosen it on my own . First of all , it it too heavy and awkward to carry around . Secondly , even at its highest the volume is not very loud . The quality of the speakers leaves a lot to be desired - They have a very " tinney " sound - Definately not for multimedia use . Worst of all is the jumping cursor . It is impossible to type without the cursor jumping randomly around the page and inserting words within words . Disabling the touchpad helps - but then what is the sense of having a touchpad ? About all this piece of junk is good for is playing solitaire .  
1	  One of my friends had these and i decided to buy one in 2004 , little did i know , i should have waited for the iPod instead . This mp3 player only lasts for about a year , and the sound quality degrades over time , to a point where you hear rasping sounds in quiet areas . Additionally , the ear buds are too big , and as time passes ( 8months ) you start to lose sound in one ear piece , then both . I tried other ear pieces but it was the same . I figured out that it is faulty wiring in these pieces of junk that cant be mended together . You 're better off buying an iPod shuffle than this crap .  
1	  Not a good start for a replacement battery . I 'm going to contact APC to see what can be done . The Original battery lasted 3 years .  
2	  Ok , after reading this you will think that I work for Westone , I don't . I have my own pair of UM1 's and I use a pair of UM2 's when I play at my church . The UM2 's have uncompairable bass quality . I don't know if i can say enough about them . We also have a pair that our bass player uses as his monitor and he said , " These are better than my Bose . " They are truly the best for not only qulaity , but also in cancellation of un-wanted noise . I 've used my UM1 's in a car ride , and operating a CAT , all you hear is the music in the highest quality . Oh this is a little bit of a side note and history of the company , they use to make the shure headpnones , then they broke off and started their own company and they are thriving . And if those ever fragile wires break , just ship it back to Westone for $ 26 and shipping and get new replacement wires installed . Again I don't work for them nor did they pay me , I 'm just another satified musician .  
1	  This camera is such a waste .. normal use even delicate use , will break this camera . I have had an older HP for years that Ive never had an issue with , but for some reason I have needed 2 replacements sent to me , due to internal software issues , the camera freezing , etc . It is way too touchy . Also their customer support is outsourced and I have a hard time getting the people to understand my problems , and they wont repair the camera , just keep sending new ones to me . This is a limited edition item , is it just supposed to sit pretty on the shelf ? I never know if they are going to send me the same model since its pretty hard to find now . A waste of time and money .  
2	  These batteries work like they are supposed to . They are much less than the Canon brand , and are well worth the price to have that piece of mind knowing that you probably wont run out of battery with these with you . The free mini tripod that came with these is pretty pointless though .  
2	  I purchased this to carry of my dvds in to save space when moving to college . Personally , I wish it was just a little cheaper , but you get your money 's worth .  
1	  I received this as a shower gift off of my registry . It works well when the monitor is upstairs and I have the receivers downstairs . But when I have them on the same floor I have to have the volume up all the way and can barely hear my 3 month old son . I can hear the neighbors daughter loud and clear . I purchased another monitor and it works so much better .  
2	  I have bought six of these for lapttops and a netbook . Thank God I use them . Had a power surge the other day and saved my Acer Aspire One Netook . I will not plug any of my laptops or netook in without using this . They are well worth the price and more .  
1	  I recieved a broken radio and the customer service rep was very rude when I called for a return shipping label at electronic expo .  
2	  This plugs into the RCA analog outputs on the PS3 cable allowing me to plug in my Plantronics GAME COM 367 Headset into the outputing 3.5mm female of the adapter .  
2	  First , Samsung could pack it much better . I had to return the first unit because of a huge dent on the DVD chassis . Amazon sent a replacement next business day so I wouldn't complain much about this . I didn't expect it perform as $ 1000-HTSystems when I placed my order . But I have to say it performs pretty well considering it 's a sub-$250 system . Pros : 1 . Adequate power to accommodate a small / med-size living room or a bedroom . ( 80watts x5speakers and 100watts x 1 subwoofer , total of 500Wrms ) 2 . Progressive scan and 3-2 pull down . PQ is really good . 3 . Multi-language support for MP3 discs . Not sure of what languages are supported . So far i was able to use cdr 's in Japanese , Korean and English . ( MP3 GUI could be better . ) 4 . Chassis fan to cool off the unit . 5 . Customizable Menu Background . Cons : 1 . No Coaxial Digital Audio input . ( it does have an optical input . ) 2 . It cuts off signals from other sources whenever disc eject button is pressed even though you 're not watching DVD movies . 3 . No component cable ? i wouldn't use theirs but still .. 4 . Remote control has a lot of room to improve . 5 . Proprietary speaker connectors and wires . Despite it lacks some of features ; DB600 is a definite keeper for me . You can't simply beat the value , performance and features of this HTS . * Update * After a month of use , i 'm loving it . i don't know if there 's any other HTS ( under $ 200 ) does everything DB600 does . You will love DVD movies with DTS . It brings a theater-like experience to your living room . yet i still think their remote control is worst thing i 've ever seen . it probably has a range of 15 degrees off of any axis otherwise it 'll not work . the reviewer above said there 's no audio output . well , there " IS " one . a headphone jack is located in front of the unit . so with a right cable , you should be able to output audio to any device . but then why would you want to copy a DVD to VHS ? not to mention Macrovision will prevent you from copying DVDs anyways . if you still need copying feature , you might want to check out Zenith XBS344 HTS . it has a DVD / VHS combo player and costs about the same .  
1	  excited to see small package here and ordered it . after got it , I tried two disc on three different computers , none works on any computer . I am going to return it .  
1	  My fiance bought me the iPod shuffle for my birthday . We tried it on THREE different computers and it didn't work on ANY of them ! So , we tried to return it and bought an iPod Mini . What a mistake ! Within the first couple of hours the screen 's contrast went to nothing - and we even had it on the darkest setting . Then , the next morning the screen decided to be visable again . BUT , on the fourth day , the thing just froze ! I couldn't turn it off or anything ! So , it made me feel like those days back in college when I had to use Apple computers and the disk drive would freeze . They never had a disk drive eject button . Why does Apple do this stuff - doesn't make sense . So , this one is going right back to the store . I would like a digital player , but just won't buy an Apple one again .  
2	  I bought a $ 65.00 dollar cord from Sears . I saw this cord on Amazon and said I 'll give it a try . I unpluged my Sears cord and put this cord into my TV . They were almost the same . A difference that I could live with because I took that Sears cord right back and got a full refund . I 'm now waiting on an HDMI to HDMI cord to come from the same company . When I need a cord I 'll be getting them from this company on Amazon for now on . Why pay more when you can pay less ! I only have a projection 1080i RCN TV that 's why I gave it a 4star . When I get my LCD Samsung I 'll update this review to let you all know about the HDMI to HDMI cord .  
1	  I excitedly bought 4 of these cameras to go snorkeling in Belize . It looks very cool and I love the little lever to snap the photos . However , the proof is in the pictures . They came out horribly grainy , plain and simple . The few that were salvageable required a great deal of retouching . Many years ago I used Kodak 's version of waterproof 35mm cameras and the picture quality was 10 times better . So that 's what I plan to go back to next time and I highly recommend others do the same to avoid disappointment .  
2	  I bought this DS-2300 to replace my DS-330 . The 330 had internal memory and I had to download every night after my 3-hour lecture . The 2300 has external memory so that I can separate items ( personal , school , work , etc ) and it stores much more than the limited amount of memory on the 330 . It has a nice size that is thin and fits into your pocket . The memory life also seems to be pretty good on this . As I had read on other reviews , the placement of the buttons might be a tad tricky , but so far no problems . My one complaint is that this recorder did * not * come with a case / pouch like the 330 . I went to the Olympus site and they offer one to European customers , but not U.S.Other than this drawback and the price , I am pleased on upgrading to the 2300 .  
1	  I bought this camera specifically because of it 's advertised " Water Resistence " . Recently , my camera was splashed , wiped dry and put into an encloseded bag . Condensation formed on the inside of the camera causing it to malfunction . I sent it to olympus who would not honor the warranty and charged me $ 186.00 to repair my camera which they advertise as all weather and water resistent . Beyond that their customer service manager , Vince was rude and sarcastic over the phone and made several degrading remarks during my call with him . I am elevating this up the Olympus management chain but I think people should know that this camera does not perform as advertised .  
1	  The adapter came through fine but it didn't work . When I contacted HP support they were not helpful at all . I can't find where to get help for this product .  
1	  This telescope was a vast dissappointment . Easy to assembleImpossible to locate and track objects in the night sky withDon't waste your money on a Bushnell product unless you get a chance to try it out before you purchase it . We are now thinking about hanging flower pots from it ! Can't think of any other useful purpose ! ?  
2	  It 's a zip drive . It works . It arrived on time . It was as described . I used it to download old info off of my zip disks and now it sits in a cabinet ! LOL !  
2	  I purchased this Alphasmart Dana for my nine-year-old daughter to help her with her homework - and she absolutely loves it ! She uses the built-in Alphaword ( word processing ) program which appears full-screen , and she prints via infrared to any one of several IR printers we have in our home ( an HP 990 , 995 , 450 portable or Photosmart 1315 , to be more specific ) . She saves all of her work to her own 32 MB SD memory card . The Alphasmart turns on immediately ( unlike a PC which needs time to boot up ) ; the batteries last for days ( and she even knows where to plug in the recharger when they get low ) . The unit is easy to use and very durable . Everything she needs to word process is self-contained in the Alphasmart Dana ; and she never needs to sync with a PC in order to use it ! ( The Alphasmart , incidentally , will also print via a USB cable - but that isn't nearly as much fun for my daughter as printing wirelessly . ) She composes her writing assignments while sitting in a chair or on a sofa . She uses a lapdesk ( that we purchased from Levenger , a mail-order company ) when she works on our bed . Needless to say , she loves the Alphasmart Dana because it allows her to use it just like " Daddy 's laptop , " which she easily prefers over sitting at a desk and typing on a standard PC.I also use the Alphasmart Dana for my own word processing ( to write product reviews such as this one ) while I 'm waiting for my daughter or her brother at their sports or music practices . I have my own SD memory card to keep my work separate . And I like how I can import the text into a MS Word document open on my computer simply by hooking up a USB cable and hitting the function key marked " send . " ( Any receiving PC can accept the data - and doesn't need to have the Alphasmart Palm desktop installed in order to do so . ) The standard dictionary and spell checker which comes with the Alphasmart Dana is fairly inadequate . I 've downloaded the Noah Pro dictionary and thesaurus from PalmGear . com , and both are significantly better . The formatting capabilities of the Alphaword program have been generally sufficient for most of my daughter 's assignments . For those times when an extra level of " prettiness " is required , my wife will normally upload the text to a MS Word file , and format the document accordingly . Neither my daughter nor I use the other Palm features ( such as calendar , address book , to-do list , or memo ) that 's included . ( I use my Palm 515 for those . ) We use the Alphasmart strictly as a friendlier , more durable - and less expensive - version of a laptop computer . In this capacity , the Alphasmart Dana has performed wonderfully . My daughter now loves to write - and does so without any prompting . The Alphasmart Dana has proven to be an excellent investment . I highly recommend it !  
1	  The plan came as promised , but the item that it covers is listed nowhere on the contract . If I needed to replace the item , would the contract cover it ?  
2	  I got a pair of these for Christmas around 2006 and had them until summer 2011 . I loved them from the first time I used them . They were the only pair of earbuds I ever used during that 4-5 year period , and they were subject to heavy use and abuse . They failed in the summer of 2011 ( one side stopped producing sound most of the time ) , but I was really surprised any earbuds survived my relatively poor treatment for that long . The sound quality was beautiful , the noise isolation was superb , the fit was excellent . I didn't have enough money to replace them over the summer when they finally broke , and now that I 'm trying to replace them .. of course it turns out that they 've been discontinued and have not been replaced with a true equivalent . I am so sad . WHY oh why were these discontinued ? Any recommendations about other pairs of headphones that I could get for ~ $ 100 would be welcomed .  
2	  Great product ! Multi adjustable , will fit almost any position . Good reception with the wireless FM transmitter . Very nice looking .  
1	  It 's a real shame that one has to go out and buy these suction cups after spending several hundred dollars on the Nuvi . Yet , the cubs quickly become fused to the windshield ( no matter what season ) , and if removed often , they quickly lose their stick . Thus , if you want to move the Nuvi between cars ( the only advantage over having a built-in GPS system ) , then you must buy extra cups for each car . I found Garmin impossible to contact !  
2	  I purchased this tv about a month ago , after researching it and last year 's model for over a year . I hesitated because I was waiting for more HD channels . I also waited for the price point of $ 800 , and then after reading more great reviews I decided to take the plunge . I 'm using it in my bedroom , which it is perfect for . The picture was the best I 've seen , bar none , but I was worried about the audio drop out problem , ( see below in discussion forum ) . However , Samsung seems to have corrected this with the latest firmware . My experience with Amazon and the ordering process was flawless . I ordered on a Monday , got an email 2 days later telling me Eagle would be contacting me for an appt . for delivery , they called on that Friday and delivered the next Monday . The guy came when expected , plugged it in , all looked good , and I spent the next few hours going through the remote and fine tuning things . i had bought an RCA OTA antenna ( $ 49 ) for local HD free channels , but it only picked up one channel , so I returned it and bought a Phillips antenna at Walmart for $ 24 , and it picks up all locals ! Just auto program the channels for OTA . I don't have HDMI cable or HD through Directv yet , but plan to when the HD dvr drops a little in price . In the meantime I checked my manufacture date , which was July 2007 , and the firmware in my tv was 1012 , the April update , so I contacted Samsung for the 1020 firmware , took 2 calls , but it was finally delivered , and easy to install . This way I 'll be ready for HDMI and HD dvr when I decide to order , with no audio drop out problems . Rest assured , this tv is great , the colors and true to life images with my OTA antenna are breathtaking ! Other channels through my Tivo look ok . It 's well worth the price and delivery , ( which I worried about ) , was flawless . I think my next purchase will be a 46 " Samsung for my den .  
1	  I purchased this because of the remote . Unfortunately , it is just not worth waiting for the dock to start . For the unit to start playing music , you have to wait for the dock to respond after you have connected the iPod . The dock takes approximately 3-4 minutes before you can use the remote to control your iPod . The video quality is awful . This dock is certainly not worth the price !  
1	  A Backup drive should be as dependable as the computer it 's backing up . But LaCie has other thoughts . Put some cheap hardware together and sell it . I have been using computers since the Radio Shack Model 1 days . And in that time I have never ever had a hard drive fail . Even so I thought a back up would be a good idea . My system using the LaCie would back up once a week at 6am . After three months the drive fails , turns into a door stop . Now I know I can send it back for warranty repair but all they are going to do is put the same undependable hardware back into it . So , whats the point . Look for another product and read the reviews which I didn't do .  
2	  This lens is amazingly sharp when using film . The bokeh is also nice . I still need to test the lens on digital . This is one of the best lenses you could ever find , so do not hesitate buying it . Build quality is more than adequate - it is not made of metal , but feels quite strong .  
2	  I have had this player for 3 weeks now and have since transfered all of my CDs to mini disc form . It 's awsome having ALL of Nirvana 's albums on one disc via LP4 recording . There are 3 recording options , stereo ( 80 minutes equals 80 minutes ) , LP2 ( 80 minutes equals 150 minutes ) and LP4 ( 80 minutes equals 300 minutes ) . The sound quality on LP4 with the bass all the way up is great . I can tell very little difference between LP2 and LP4 . It is so small it can fit in your pocket . I only wish there were more accessories for these gadgets ( carrying cases for the discs in particular ) . The only flaw ; each track can be labeled so you can see it on the " display screen " . Just put a CD into your drive and " MD simple Burner " will find the name of the CD and each track name . The problem is that only so many letters can be programed to a disc . Most of the time it isn't a problem , however when copying a number of soundtracks to one disc , when the artist and song name appears on each track , it quicly runs out of letter space . All you have to do is edit the track names and " dumb " them down ( eliminating the " the 's " , " Ands " ect ) . Albums are grouped together and are easily accessed , eliminating all the skipping through song after song to get to an album . There are 2 parts of the software , the " MDnet Simple Burner " used to burn CDs , and " OpenMG Jukebox " , which is used to copy MP3s to the device . The Open MG is hard to use at first , but you 'll get the hang of it . Oh , best of all . These babies don't skip ! You can put it in your pocket and run at full speed , crash your car , get into a bar fight .. and it plays perfectly ! :) In short , pitch your portable CD players . Minidisc forever !  
1	  Well , there is no way to improve the very poor tuner .. unable to get even the strongest stations without some other station stepping on it . CD player works if you move the secret switch on the side - Very poor monoral sound .. no real stereo .. kind of sound like a kids toy . Mounting , however , was a real treat - no prob at all and very straightforward . Still , all you have is a second rate unit .  
1	  Well it 's cheap , it has a high cut-off , and I cant say I am all that impressed with it at all . This is not a coated filter , instead it is just colored glass . While it does filter to the IR range , I would recommend essentially any other brand . It even came with marks on the glass , presumably from uneven dying .  
1	  I bought this software because I am a grad student and I had to survey alpine sites around the state of Colorado . I thought it would be great . It was not . The biggest problem is that the maps are out of date . For example several hiking trails are missing . I drove up at least ten roads that had locked gates that were not on the map . Many roads are not labeled or not labeled correctly . It was good for putting waypoints in my GPS , but that is all it was good for .  
2	  The reason I bought this amp was the High Current and The Beauty of it . But then I had it installed , oh my god ! This thing is so powerful with it 's 4 40 amp fuses , 2 cooling fans and did I say High Current .. I have this amp hooked up to 1 1000 watt Eclipse 12inch Subwoofer inside of my Ford Expedition , and did I say High Current , to be blunt this amp has never cut off once from over heating , and i 've had some nice amps in my day .. So if you have a need for the last amp you 'll ever buy , get the A2300HCT BY AUDIOBAHN - DARRYL OF BALTIMORE  
1	  I bought this item to hook up my iPod to my factory Nissan radio . I have used several FM Modulators in the past and I have found it to be a relatively easy and inexpensive way to go , until now . After all the adaptors , I spent about $ 100 . I should have gone with one of those icruise ( ? ) units instead for $ 129 . The sound quality is horrible . I 'm no audio geek . I went from a tape adaptor to this and now back to a tape adaptor because it sounds 100 times better . I emailed Pyle and I will see what they say , but even if they offer to fix / replace it , their web site says they want $ 15 for return postage .. You may also want to know that Pyle has discontinued this unit in favor of the PLMD3 .  
2	  Burned wood for six hours kept eight people warm while kids made smores and moms drank wine , was a good night for all . The stars and moon cutout gave a nice reflection . Very easy to put together .  
2	  I have an iPhone and I recently got this audio system . It works well with my iPhone , and is a great overall system . When I plug my phone into the iM600 my phone asks if I want to go into Airplane Mode - this is usually what I do . You can't receive calls or texts , but you don't get any speaker interference . If you want to be able to take calls , you 'll get some speaker interference occasionally , but it 's not too terrible . It also charges my phone at night which is quite handy .  
1	  I 've had this camera for over a year . It 's a gamble to use however . You 'll either be able to finalize your discs with no problems and have a great little DVD of your favorite moments , or it will have an error and erase everything ! It 's really up to how it feels at the moment , too . You have to record without moving as well , remember , there 's a tiny laser etching data inside there and any sudden turns will erase the disk . If you can get it to work , the picture will look FANTASTIC ! But it 's really too much a gamble to take . Don't buy .  
1	  I bought this unit because I had an other " Brother " before . What a mistake . I had it for over a year , very light use ( a few copies , a few faxes ) . The machine uses a lot of ink . It performs self-cleaning every day . You run out of ink in a few months even if you are not using it . With no ink you cannot send or receive faxes ( even you are out of yellow and the fax report is printed black ) . Now I cannot send faxes at all , I am getting some " com " error . Its memory is full all the time ( 99 %) and sometimes prevents you sending faxes . Do not waste your money , go other place .  
2	  good quality , nice design , sets up and works flawlessly ( did not have same problem with sleep as prior poster , it does sleep but comes out of sleep mode transparently as soon as you move it ) . i have used this product under FreeBSD 5 , FreeBSD 6 , and occasionally WinXP , on a ThinkPad T43 and now a ThinkPad T60p . i like the bluetooth over the normal USB dongle wireless for two reasons : 1 ) no dongle to lose or break off2 ) no interference from other devices if you have more than one wireless mouse or keyboard in the same area . great product . don't know why i don't see it more often in retail stores , you have to go online to get it .  
2	  I 've tried a few non-OEM batteries in my 40D , but they never seem to last as long as the Canon branded battery . The battery works well , came in factory packaging with Canon branding , so it looks like it 's the real thing . I 've gotten some bad knock-off 's on eBay , but this one looks legit .  
1	  DONT BUY MAGELLAN ! Totally unreliable , died when I needed it during a trip in Florida . The Call support center has been outsourced to the Phillipines ! I had to send the dead unit to Texas . They have had it for almost one month , cannot fix it and do not have a replacement to ship to me . So I continue to wait in limbo . Will never buy a Magellan again or recommend it to anyone .  
1	  Thia was supposed to be a portable mp3 player but it wouldn't work unless it was charging  
2	  The CD player is great and it has yet to skip , but my major complaint are the headphones . They are so small that I dont see how any male could wear these . They are the perfect size for my 2 year old . Other than that , it is a great buy .  
2	  It works right from the box . Signal strength is good with USR2410 PC card . It 's better with the unit in vertical position in my house as the manual says to try so . The DI-713P is at one end of the house and USR2410 is at the other end , pretty far away . I am using MAC filtering and the wireless connection picked up right after reboot . Both wired and wireless connections are great . Will try WEP and SSID later . That 's why it 's 4 stars for now . My hardware version is E1 and firmware 257b6a .  
2	  These cables perform as expected but I do not like the release mechanism . They are a little difficult to release in tight spaces where you may not be able to see or get more than one finger in . If you plan on installing these in a rack and rarely / never removing them , they 're fine , but for offices or travel , I would not recommend them .  
2	  This is crystal clear in sound and feels more durable than the two that I purchased from Wal-Mart and paid twice the price for . By the way , both of them broke and this one is lightweight and works great !  
1	  Here 's from an email I sent to Rio . Three weeks and four follow-up messages later , I 've yet to hear anything back . -I 'm a frustrated first-time Rio customer . Here 's my story . Last winter , my wife - Helen - became jealous of my Creative Jukebox Zen . ( It 's a fantastic product if any of you guys are in the market . Great sound quality and reliable as the sunrise . ) So in January of 2004 , I bought her a Rio Nitrus at Best Buy for $ 230 . Within 10 days , it stopped working , so we returned it to store where I bought it . Just a few weeks later , the new one stopped working . Best Buy wouldn't touch it , so I contacted Rio customer support . They gave me an RMA and , a few weeks after that , a new ( refurbished ) Rio Nitrus was delivered to my door . That was a couple of months ago . Yesterday it stopped working again . I turn on the power , and the Rio splash-screen appears for about 60 seconds . Then it starts making these weird clicking noises , displays the text " upgrader " on the screen and remains completely unresponsive any input . When I reset using a paperclip , it turns off , but powering it back on again yields the same results . The knowledge-base on RioAudio . com suggested that I upgrade the firmware , so I downloaded the latest and plugged in . My computer recognized the USB device , but the updater ( RioNitrusFlash_123 . exe ) said that the operation timed out . Then I tried the same thing on a different computer , my laptop . Same results . Three different Rio Nitrus units in the past six months . None has lasted more than 90 days . Working in software the software industry , I know that the first tendency of many customer support representatives is to blame the user . And considering the technical aptitude and general intelligence of the American consumer , that attitude is usually justified . You probably have a favorite story of someone prying the case open with a butterknife or washing it in the dishwasher or something . So let me assure you this device has been subject to nothing but the most scrupulous care imaginable . Helen rarely even uses the thing , to my disappointment . Certainly no children have ever touched it . And my Creative mp3 player has lasted almost two years under a much heavier work-load . I just got off the phone with your support-line . Sandey helped me out , and seemed like a very nice man . He said that the thing was outside of warranty , but given the circumstances of my case he offered to reduce the out-of-warranty fee from $ 100 to $ 50 . I told him something like this , " It isn't enough that it doesn't work ? That I 've spent tens of hours on support-lines troubleshooting the stupid thing ? Now I have to pay $ 50 for a new one because Rio can't make a quality product ? " He sympathized , but said there was nothing he could do . I believed him , but I wouldn't buy a brand new Rio Nitrus fo $ 50 . I don't want to yell or curse at Sandy , or anyone else from customer support for that matter . I know that customer service didn't engineer this thing , you didn't test it , you didn't approve its release to manufacturing . And although I might have a few words to say for that last group , what really bugs me is the warranty policy : 90 days ! So you 're telling me that Rio believes in the quality of its products so much that it stands behind them with an iron-clad 90 day warranty ? I 'd like to see that on the marketing collateral : " After three months , you 're on your own ! " Or ( if I felt like a real smart-mouth ) " Rio Nitrus : The one product your goldfish are sure to outlive . " I don't have any stick to threaten you with . Customer support is immune to further customer complaints at this point , if my experience has been anything close to typical . I guess I could post this email on my web-site , along with any humorously un-helpful responses you send me . Or maybe I could even forward this message to ArsTechnica and CNet and related publications . If it 's a slow week for tech news , they might look into it . Probably not , though . I could make the moral argument . I bought this product in good faith , expecting it to work . It doesn't , and all I get is " Sorry buddy , but that 's our policy . " That probably won't do any good either . The worst part is that this isn't even mine . It 's belongs to my wife , and I bought her a crappy Christmas present through no fault of my own . What I want is either ( 1 ) my money back , or ( 2 ) credit for my purchase price at the Rio company store , or ( 3 ) a new Rio Nitrus waiving any out-of-warranty fee . If you don't have the authority to help me , please forward this case to someone who does .  
2	  This was a great price and works great . It is compatable with IPod Nano 2nd generation .. be careful , some are not ! This is also a great back up car charger . Some reviews say its not powerful enough , but I 'm not sure what they are trying to do with it . Its works great for me in my car and on the boat . I completely recommend this .  
2	  I used a couple of these to connect external antennas to a router for a wifi hotspot . I had one break on me , the N-jack twisted off but its easy to slide back on , and this was because i was twisting it too much unnecessarily . So they 're not impervious : be careful not to twist or bend it too much . Otherwise works as advertised and I am satisfied with the 3 that I bought .  
2	  I wanted to mention several things in this review to help people out not generally covered in other reviews . One of which is that I 'm left handed , and have drawn digitally with a mouse for over 10 years now . I am not unfamiliar with tablets , but perhaps I can give a unique perspective as I 've now used all three versions of the intuos line . 1 , 2 and 3 . I 'm left handed and with products made with right handers in mind I used to digitally illustrate my pictures with a combination of keyboard shortcuts and using the mouse with my wrong hand . This is really a good sized tablet for the intermediate or professional illustrator . The smaller 4x5 is a bit flawed in its design due to the fact that was designed more with the right handed person in mind . Onto the 6x8 - In the years Wacom has produced 3 models I say that the 3 is the greatest improvement overall . It 's closest rival is the original Intuos ( 1 ) . The intuos 3 has a pen grip similar to the 1 but made more comfortable with the rubber grip . This is a vast improvement over the 2 make because the duo switch kept falling off and its fatter pen made it more difficult to handle strokes . The other major improvement is the express keys . Users familiar with the older intuos may have found that menu bar obnoxious unhelpful and annoying . Now the express keys solves what I mentioned in my title . As a user who is used to keyboard shortcuts , I found the biggest hinderance for me was losing my drawing groove as I switched from the keyboard to the tablet because I knew the shortcut key than dragging my pen over to get it to respond . For example with Photoshop , many of us are familiar with Undo / Step Backward and Redo / Step Forward . Instead of interrupting your drawing and having to reach for the keyboard , the tablet has a driver that allows you to program your express keys . You can now do this on the fly with less hassle . Touch strip annoying you because of your dominant hand ? You can disable it too . You get 8 buttons on this model so you 'll find a way to chose your settings instead of reaching for a keyboard . Another interesting feature of the express keys is the PRESSURE HOLD . This is a great function since I know many times as an illustrator I 've wanted to recreate a stroke at a certain pressure and it doesn't come out quite close as the first . By using pressure hold you can keep a consistent pressured stroke . Intuos 3 comes with some new nibs that you can use with your pen . I 've found the ink / stroke nib it came with very nice and close to how I ink traditionally and I 'd definitely recommend that to any illustrator who deals with inking . The brush nib I 'm not so sure how to review since painting traditionally isn't something I do as regularly , but I 'm grateful Wacom included this with their new line . Wacom 's sleek redesign of the intuos is definitely GEEK BLING . I love the feel and how comfortable it feels while I work on artwork . One thing you may worry about is that the new line doesn't have an overlay sheet as its predecessors , fear not however , if you scratch it there are replacement parts . Wacom also has great customer service for the tablet . So your money is very well spent . The only other thing I 'd like to mention is that you should download the latest driver from the site instead of the driver that came with your software . For the software , while basic , I found that the videos that came with the Painter Essentials 3 DVD bundle to be rather helpful . This is really good for people who feel overwhelmed by painter because it covers basics and makes it easier to realize how versatile the program is . I 'm very happy I invested into this product especially since the intuos 3 now solves problems I had when adjusting to digital illustration .  
1	  I took a chance and bought this even though I saw the bad reviews . I thought to myself " it 's only a dollar , if it dies in a month or two like the reviews say , I will just get something else because this does have some good reviews .. " This completely ruined my Ipod Classic 80 gig . My Ipod was 1 month old , I had to return it and get a refurbished one because of this ! It shipped to me real quick so I was happy , then i took it out of the packaging and right away charged my Ipod to a full battery relatively quickly , still happy . Then I went to listen to my Ipod .. Every single song was complete static ! I restored it to factory settings and reloaded with the same problem . I took it back to apple who restored it again and put their music on it and they got the same results ! I have never written a review before , but I felt the need to warn anybody who is on the fence about buying this .  
2	  Works great . Reception is very clear . Only caveats are that there 's no battery indicator other than an audible warning when you 're about to run out of power , and that this will interfere with wireless networks using the 802.11g protocol .  
1	  Offered Belkin Xm Auto Cassette Adapter at $ 425.00 off list . Shipped Philips Cassette Adapter . I don't understand why Firemall doesn't just say the item is a Philips ? I was expecting Belkin quality and durability . Time will tell how long the Philips will last . I am sure Amazon customers would be upset if they were offered Starbucks at a discount price and received Folgers . Surprising customers is not good for business . The item shipped isPhilips Cassette Adapterwhich appears to be identical toPHILIPS MP3 / CD / iPod Cassette Adapter . Both have decent reviews .  
2	  Works absolutely great as a factory replacement . The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is because I 'm not sure about longevity , only been using it a few weeks now . Works perfectly so far !  
1	  The CD function stopped working after a few months and the tuner is an absolute hair trigger - hitting it by accident closing the shower curtain this morning moved it more than 3MHz ! To avoid the problem the other reviewer notes concerning it falling , I untied one end of the rope that allows it to hang . I looped that around the shower curtain and retied it . That lets the cord act as a safety line for when the suction fails .  
2	  This is a truly great product - I just put it in my Dell Inspiron 8100 and connected my USB 2.0 Maxtor 2000LE external harddrive and it works like a champ . The review by ' the great entity ' regarding not working with PC chipsets is completely incorrect - it almost caused me not to buy this product . Pay no attention - this card works as advertised . I also have an IO Gear KVM switch that I 'd also highly recommend - you can't beat the price , specs , or the fact that it includes all the cables for 4 devices . Way to go IOGear !  
2	  Purchased two of these for my powered PA speakers . Great concept with the right angle plug . I would have gladly paid more to get a 16 or 14 gauge wire . Never felt good about running power equipment on less than 16 ga . wire . They are ok , just wish they were heavier .  
2	  I bought a 12 " Powerbook back in 2004 and did not buy a case at the time . I recently decided I would like one and tried to pick one up at the Apple store . Per the packaging , the case I bought was compatible with my 12 " Powerbook . In reality , it was designed for the 13 " Macbook so my 12 " computer was very loose inside the case and slid around everywhere . This case is designed for the 12 " model so it fits like a glove . The added pocket is a great extra feature as well to put the power cord , extra battery etc . This is THE option for your 12 " Powerbook .  
2	  Sleek design and easy setup provided immediate impression of a well-designed product . Even the internet applications were up and running with the step-by-step instructions for the various applications . With HDMI connection , picture quality is excellent on our Samsung monitor . Excellent choice for a well-priced unit from Amazon !  
2	  I got these to replace my 4 yr old Senn px 100 which suddenly got broken at the miniplug , these are not as comfortable as the Px 100 but they do sound great and give you more bass because they are tighter against your ears but with an offer from another site which ended costing me just $ 5.00 i could not pass them up . They 're also very sensitive which makes them ideal for Ipods and other portable devices .  
2	  First off I purchased my unit from another source who bench checked it for me before they shipped it just to make sure I was getting a good unit , and it is . This little radio is simply amazing and out preforms my $ 300.00 + Grundig Satellite 750 , and it does it with just the whip antenna and inside my house to boot , and outside with a 30'simple wind up antenna attached it is simply amazing , and the AM side is wonderful also . Buy this little radio you wont regret it . ( PS ) I have found that if you use a pair of descent stereo headphones like the ones you use on airplanes it improves this radio 100 % when listening to AM / FM and SW stations making them much more clearer then when using the little junk internal speaker , in fact I have found that it is the only way you should use this radio .  
1	  It is a relatively affordable hardware monitor calibration tool . For the hardware sensor , the suction cups don't really work well unless the screen has a " glossy " glass front covering the LCD panel . I don't know how well it calibrates monitors with large color gamuts as mine does since I have nothing to compare this with , but post calibration colors are different . My main gripe with the product is it 's subpar software . A perfect piece of software should never remind the user quite arrogantly that " I 'M HERE , YOU BOUGHT ME ! LOOK ! " . The Pantone Pro software does exactly this by showing a splash screen on every startup . What is this , the early 2000s ? There is only 1 purpose for the Pantone software , and it should be to evaluate light levels at user set time intervals . The software does this well . But the software is also required to load the calibrated . ICC profile . So , if the user does not want light levels evaluated and compensated for , the user must still load the proprietary software just to initiate the . ICC profile . This , I must say , is an extreme and vulgar fault . Pantone makes a profit from hardware sales and their proprietary software is available for anyone to download online . So , why not just have the proprietary software produce an . ICC profile that Windows itself can use without the extra bloat ?  
2	  This mouse is just the right size for traveling and for everyday use . I 'm still learning to use all the features and have enjoyed being able to zoom , switch between screens , and search , all from the mouse . I wouldn't recommend it for children until they get some control and understanding of how a mouse works and when they are able to understand the funtions of the various buttons . It 's been a joy to use and I recommend it highly .  
1	  I purchased this cable in hopes of using my laptop while connected to my Samsung 40 " TV . The TV has a " PC " VGA connector which is easily selectable from the remote . My first surprise was that the audio cable was only about 12 inches long . I needed one to be about 2 feet long in order to reach the audio output on the front right of my laptop . I carefully connected the cable to the TV and the laptop . The screw knobs were very short and did not have a screw driver slot . I fired up the computer and put the TV to the " PC " source . Nothing showed on the screen . I checked connectors on both ends for bent pins . The cable looked fine and was properly secured but provided no signal from the laptop . I borrowed a different brand of cable from a friend and it worked perfectly . I am returning the cable tomorrow and purchasing a different brand with a longer audio cable .  
1	  I have two PCs off a WRT54GS router . I first purchased two PCI speedbooster cards . One works great under Win98 . However , the other card would not work with XP in my other machine . The other I had to eBay for a $ 40 loss . Someone in a tech forum said to try the USB adapter instead if running XP . Well I bought this device and it worked great for two months . Until one morning last week . When I booted up , the piece of # @ $ ! wouldn't find an IP , and the link light was just blinking . No dice in the network config . One day it was working perfectly , and the next day it wasn't . I still can't get it to work , either with the Linksys drivers ( not recommended by many ) OR by XP config . It works fine with my older WinME PII 933 box like the PCI card . Looks like I 'll have to eBay this thing as well for yet another $ 40 loss . NOT VERY HAPPY ! Right now I am dead in the water with that PC . Since Linksys obviously can't get their adapters to work stable with newer systems and operating systems , I 'm switching to Belkin or D-Link . Linksys got the last of my money . If you have a newer system or have custom built a newer system like me or are running XP , beware !  
1	  I purchased this mouse thinking it was rechargeable ( due to the fact the ad and my receipt said that it is rechargeable ) , it 's not ! They sent me three mouse 's to make up for this and to get me the right mouse . Every mouse they sent me was not rechargeable ! Finally they had to refund me because they could not provide me with a rechargeable mouse ! My receipt even said rechargeable mouse ! This is completely misleading and unprofessional ! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT ! Better business burue was contacted about this situation ! Completely 100 % dissatisfied with The company and with Amazon . com ! Will not use your service again ! Absolute HORROR ! ! ! PAIN IN THE BUTT ! ! ! !  
1	  I got this set to use with my Panasonic Lumix G1 and 45-200 lens . The first thing I noticed was the filters were filthy ( about par for cheap filters ) . Also , there was a spot on the + 1 and a big smudge on the + 2 that would not come off . I was able to autofocus well through the filters . However , the image quality degraded when using the filters . It was the equivalent of losing resolution-going in 1:1 showed blurry pixels instead of crisp ones . I asked for a refund and got one from the seller . If you care about image quality , try another brand . Right now , so far so good with the Tiffen set . Rating : two stars because it is functional .  
2	  I have been using these Binocs for about 6 months now and find them a genuine joy everytime I bring them out . On a recent autumn evening from a hotel balcony overlooking a golf course I was able to take in a marvelous variety of deep space objects . The sky was fairly dark - but by no means out in the country - and I saw the beauty of M4 , M8 , M20 , M26 , M16 , M13 , M31 , M27 , .. and more . These are definitely Astro binoculars . They do need a tripod . You focus each eye individually . And there is some fade out in sharp focus as the eye reaches the outer edges of the field of view . This is not something I get worried about for $ 250 . Maybe $ 1250 . I have a Sunpack heavy duty photo tripod that goes for about $ 80 at Best Buy , and I use the Sunpak adapter to attach the Celestron . It is NOT the sturdiest set-up , but I found that I put the tripod into some very warped positions ( one leg sometimes ) and walk it around for better views . I can fit the entire Plaeides into the FOV and the view of the Orion Nebula shows nearly the entire swrd . Glorious ! And one more thing - because the eyepieces focus individually , you don't have to worry about collimation issues . I had ordered a Skymaster 15x70mm that were so out they gave me a headache to look through them . I did get another pair , however , and they were fine . I don't know why Amazon has this listed within Toys - it 's one heavy toy . Educational and fun , but not for a child . Just wanted to note that as a safety issue .  
1	  I would like to give this a higher rating simply for the relatively long lasting battery life . It is also easy to carry around , since it is so small . However , after having it for a few months the mouse has started to get skitso . The mouse will start bouncing around the screen when you try to move . You have to be very careful when using it for you might click somewhere you don't want to . To sum it up , I have to give this a 1/5 because I intend to buy a new mouse immediately . This was crap .  
1	  You will want to either stomp on this piece of junk or bang your head against a wall just trying to use the software that you are delimited to using ! It is so painful to even get one track on the player ! And when you do , it shuffles the information around ( the track becomes the album title instead , etc . ) . Seriously , get an iPod Nano instead of this miserable crap . Or don't , and kick yourself in the @ $ forever ! CAVEAT EMPTOR !  
1	  I burn a lot of CDs , so you can imagine , I go through 50 a month , and mostly audio CDs . And I was a believer that all CD-Rs are the same . The CDs seemed fine until I got a bit over half way through and the last 15-20 CD-Rs in this batch would not play back on my CD players . I thought it was my drive and I just got a batch of Maxell and everything is fine again . A real let-down , so basically 15 of the CDs in this batch would not play back ! I 've never had an experience like this before , POS !  
1	  I really wanted to like this mp3 player . I was trying to replace my 1G Shuffle , which has been kind physically contorted with superglue since the cheap Apple armband snapped off the USB connector . My main purpose : to use it at the gym and to be able to listen to some podcasts when I 'm walking around Downtown ( I was in Seattle at the time ) . I kept trying to defend its problems , but the last straw was when it broke in under 6 months . The right channel of sound just stopped working altogether . If I was an electrical engineer I might take it apart and try tightening whatever was loose to cause this problem , but I honestly didn't even feel that it was worth doing that . Let me list all the things I hated about it : -I 'll start with the issue of crashing . It crashed a few times a week . It would just be playing a song , and then it would freeze . Or it would be choppy in playing a track . That was especially irritating . - The navigation was completely unintuitive on it . It was not easy or enjoyable to move around in it or select tracks . - No one mentions this , but it 's a huge problem : you CANNOT make playlists on the computer ! I tried all sorts of things to try to make one and put it on there , but none of my attempts worked , and the manual only explains making playlists on the device . You have no idea how frustrating it is to have to make playlists for the gym on the device , which would take me at least 5-10 minutes for a 5 or 6 hour playlist . I much preferred using iTunes . - The radio receiver was really bad . I 'd have to be in the right place at the right time to get clear reception of anything . - The screen quality so not as good as it may appear in the pictures . Looking at photos on this thing is not worth trying . - If you stop listening to your playlist to just play normal music , it doesn't remember where you 're at . - It 's a little bigger than it looks , especially in a neoprene case for working out . - It didn't come with any special software , you just use Windows Media Player . - The battery life was not that great . It may have lasted 7-10 hours . My 1G Shuffle was a lot better than that . I really can't think of any reasons to get this device . The armband I bought from DLO for it worked a lot better than the Apple armband for my shuffle , but that 's about it . Even for just working out , this device isn't worth it . You could pay a few more bucks and get a 2G Shuffle if you 're looking for a low-end device ; the new one is actually easier for workouts .  
1	  I bought one of these two days ago , and unfortunately I 'm having the same speaker problems described by the previous reviewer . The right speaker stopped working , and would occasionally make buzzing / static noises . I also noticed an extremely loud and irritating " hum " when I plugged my headphones into the headphone jack . I 'm very disappointed , because this TV was wonderful for the first 48 hours - gorgeous picture quality , amazing sound ( for a TV anyway - not as good as my stereo system , but better than the other TVs I looked at , including Sony ) . Looks like Samsung may have a lemon with this model . I hope they can fix it , because the design and features of this TV are really nice , and the fact that it 's $ 50 less than a comparable Sony - and with better audio quality - is a big selling point .  
1	  if you 're looking for an inexpensive solution to get 200mm , then i guess this is a winner . if you expect to have a reasonably sharp photo at 200mm then you will be disappointed . it 's a fine lens until you rack it out . then the photo just falls apart .  
2	  I bought this card for my Sony HDR-HC3 camcorder to record still pictures . This card will allow me to record over 1,000 pictures at 4 MP clarity . Works great and I highly recommend it . Bob  
1	  Stay away from this piece of crap ! I bought this item because , after rebates , it would havebeen the least expensive of its kind . I say WOULD HAVEBEEN , but the manufacturer lost the UPC code that I sentit , and denied my rebate . They said they would accept acopy of it , but still I wait . Meanwhile , this item has one of two possible chipsets init . The guy at the store said it had the Intersil Prismchip , for which my driver works well . No , it actually hadthe Ralink RT2570 . So I installed the driver from Ralink , and what a disaster . My linux box has never been so unstable . The internet link through this D-Link adapter would crashoften ( about every 10 minutes ) , and not restart unless Ireloaded the driver . And that would crash the whole system30 percent of the time . I replaced this item with a Netgear WG111 v2 , and it worksso much better . I have to use the WinXP driver , and it hassome stability problems , but stays connected for days . While my past experiences are not necessarily an indicationof your future experience , why take the chance ?  
2	  Was I surprised when I got this in the mail . It 's so tiny . Of course the item page didn't hide the size . It says " 5 inches " . I just didn't realize how small 5 inches was . So get your rulers out and see for yourself before you buy . But it 's very nice . It 's sturdy and you can position the bendable legs so many different ways . I got it for my Zoom H1 digital audio recorder and it 's perfect . I thought I could use it for my Flip Ultra camcorder but Flip has the tripod hole on the bottom of their unit but over to the side rather than centered so you have to go through contortions to position the tripod legs in a way so the Flip doesn't fall over sideways so I 'll just use it for my Zoom . And the price .. 2.95 . You can't beat that .  
2	  Garmin 60CSx returned , because half of menu buttons did not function . Amazon promptly replaced with new functioning unit .  
1	  When I bought this item , I had great expectations that it would upgrade my listening options immensely by being able to use my iPod in the car . Using a pre-set radio frequency on the in-dash radio , the Irock plugs into the iPod so that music can be played through the car 's speakers . The results for me , however , were mixed at best . On the good side , it was great to be able to access all of my music at my fingertips when all of my pre-set stations were playing commercials . On the flip side , the quality of the transmission from the irock to the iPod was not only lacking in listening quality punch , but was also intermittent and would fade in and out enough to make the experience unpleasurable . In the end , I decided to upgrade my stereo and get an Auxiliary Out feature , which while much more expensive , the quality is as though you had used the Aux Out feature on your home stereo and there is no degradation of sound . If your budget dictates that you would have no other option , the Irock is a good solution if your expectations are scaled back . Note : if you buy this product and leave it in the car , make sure not to place anything of any weight over it as the power button is very sensitive and your battery will drain down .  
2	  Used this to record a wedding at our church and did not want to run new cables . Proper placement of transmitter and receiver is the key . Transmission must be line-of-sight , without interruptions . Broadcasted 50 ' from podium to back of auditorium with no problems .  
1	  You might find this to be pertinent .. I bought the same style LaCie about a year ago , but the 250 GB version . This unit was defective right out of the box . I couldn't use it AT ALL ! Very loud random clicking sounds . I phoned the company the day it arrived , and they graciously replaced it . A year later , the replacement is still working with no apparent problem , although I hear a much softer version of the clicking-which sounds ominous to me , given the history . ( Who can know whether it 's normal ? ) Thinking that was just a fluke ( I should read more ! ) , I recently bought two of LaCie 's little stackable drives that match the Mac Mini . I 've barely started to use those ( strictly for backup ) , but so far , they 're doing fine . My advice would be to steer clear of any LaCie drive that is of roughly the same physical shape as the one in question , since they might be subject to the same design flaw . The little mini-Mac drives are of a significantly different shape , so obviously have a different mechanical design-and hopefully better . And if you do still go with LaCie , also be careful not to buy a noisy one . Don't know if they still sell them , but I stopped using an older LaCie drive simply because it was extraordinarily noisy . Specifically ask .  
1	  This is absolutely no laser photo paper . Better quality on regular paper . I tried once , I tried twice , the same bad result .  
2	  I got this a year ago , and it 's just wonderful . Both the picture and sound are first class . It replaced a crappy Toshiba player that was the biggest piece of electronic crap I have ever purchased . this is so much better , I swear it makes my dvd 's sound and look better than any other player I have seen . Highly recommended .  
2	  After a four week wait , I received my Apple wireless bluetooth keyboard ( shipped direct from China ) a couple of days ago . Without a doubt , it has already become one of my all-time favorite Mac accessories in 20 years of Apple use . Even if you 've seen photos and read stats about its dimensions , that won't prepare you for how compact the keyboard is in person . It is spectacularly thin and minimalistic : if a keyboard could be called " beautiful , " then this one is without a doubt a beauty . Not only does it save an enormous amount of desk real estate , it manages to make the previous Apple keyboards ( once upon a time fairly sleek-looking in comparison to other keyboards on the market ) look dowdy , bulky and hopelessly outdated . Much has been made of the lack of a numerical keypad : I see this is as a plus , allowing the keyboard to be highly portable and super small . If you truly need a numerical keypad , the wired version of this keyboard has one . The tactile quality of the keyboard is great . It takes a while to get used to the different feel the keys - they are flat rather than slightly concave - but the overall feel and usability are an improvement . The unit pairs up with your Mac seamlessly and there is no delay or lagtime in typing ; the keyboars also wakes seamlessly from sleep at the touch of any key . In short , I see no downside : it looks great , is stunningly thin and sleek , eliminates wire clutter , works wonderfully , and saves a lot of desk space . I can recommend it without reservation to anyone looking for a wireless keyboard . Kudos , Apple , on an incredible job updating an everyday appliance most of us took for granted in such an elegant way that it doubles as a functional object of industrial art .  
2	  I hooked up this monitor to my Dell P4 2.5G PC and played Need for speed underground on it with no negative video issues . The monitor is very adjustable - tilt up / down / left / right , and you can also tilt it horizontally . Colors are true and clear , and internet navigation views are very good . The only drawback I noticed was that some screen fonts are not crisp , & clean . Some fonts have jagged edges to them . But , overall I would recommend this monitor . Key Numbers-19 " Viewable Diagnonal3 year part & labor on site warrenty ( the only reason I considered it in the first place ) Monitor can be used Vertically , or HorizontallyComes with extra cable for dual monitor hookup .  
2	  i 'm sitting here with a pair of ath-anc7 and bose qc2 , confirming the common wisdom about these two . four stars to the anc7 - would 've been five if it was as comfortable to wear as the qc2 . details : 1 . build quality : they both have similar form factors , but the anc7 seems way sturdier . my bose-owning friends say the qc 's start falling apart after a year or two . 2 . comfort : bose wins hands down . both are comfortable enough to wear all day ( done that ) , but the cloth screens in the bose are strategically tilted in the rear to stay away from your ears . it 's a big difference . 3 . sound : they both sound great , but different . the anc7 is a flatter , brighter hi-fi sound . the bose is warmer , with a bass boost and attenuated highs . you can make the anc7 sound like the bose with simple eq ( on itunes , choose the " small speakers " eq setting ) . i tend to do that when using the anc7 's for background music at work , and use flat eq when i 'm actually paying attention . i listen to mostly jazz , your rock and roll experience may be different . 4 . noise suppression : the anc7 is much better at suppressing the airconditioner noise here in the office , subjectively i 'd say 30 % better . i 've tried neither of these on a plane . both of these give you a subtle , strange anechoic feeling ( like you 've put your ears in just a bit of a vacuum ) . i 'll blame the noise cancellation for that , not knowing any better . a non-anc headphone like the grado does not give that feeling .  
1	  Purchased two separate units , both of which have failed in exactly the same way as detailed in the CNET discussion forms . Works for a few months , and then one day * poof * your data is no longer accessible . It 's not a coincidence - it 's a crappy , flawed product which is eventually going to have a class actions suit filed ( as evidenced by the Sklar lawfirm 's website and numerous discussion boards ) .  
1	  I bought this receiver because it says that it has 6.1 discrete sound . You will be sorry to find out that H / K has deceived the market - THIS RECEIVER ONLY HAS 5.1 SOUND which makes it no different from all the other cheapies out there . It sounds exactly the same as the .. Sony I had before this . I should have put the money into upgrading my speakers . I thought I was taking a step up - Oh how wrong I was ! Wish I bought the Onkyo .  
2	  This tool worked with my ' 01 passat to get out the stock stereo where a clip was bentonly downside is the tool is way too sharp I cut my thumb in a few places trying to get thekey to clip in with the bent one inside the radio but it works I would advise wearing gloves just in case  
1	  I live in NYC , the most crowded city in the U.S. and guess what . They can't find one repair center who would come to my apartment to fix my Samsung 40 " LCD TV . They don't have their own repairman , they give you numbers of repair center and you have to contactthem and make it happen . It 's like a double work . Not to mention all the customer service representativesI 've been talking have such bad attitudes plus they never return phone calls . They told me that they are still searching for repair centers who can come to Manhattan andhow long have I been waiting for their phone calls ? It 's been a month already since my TV broke . Don't even bother to talk to their supervisor . They don't return your phone calls , either . I really wonder if anyone there actually work . I will NEVER buy single product from companies that offer Repairtech for a warranty !  
1	  I have owned 2 different rio products , both of which have failed me within 4-5 months of purchase . The life expectancy of their mp3 players is poor , as is their waranty , as I was told that for 100 dollars and the unit they would give me a new one . The hard drive went out on both mp3 players , and I was told that your not supposed to move the player when its in use . Never mind the fact that its a portable mp3 player . Other than the fact that its hard drive died , my rio nitrous was an outstanding value .. until it died . Dont take my word for it . Check out what everyone else thinks on epinions . com  
2	  The installation of this product was simple and very easy . A data cable and the electrical plug is included in package . Quality product .  
2	  These memory upgrade cards installed with no problem on the computer board and worked as I hoped they would when I turned the computer on . That is all there was to it , and my computer now has twice the memory and is much faster . No problems what-so-ever . Thanks , Cuerno Verde Kid .  
1	  If you have done your planning around using 14 gauge wire per various articles and tech documents , you will not be installing what you think you are . Virtually all docs ( and nearly every normal human ) assume you will be using copper wire . This wire is aluminum with a thin copper coating . Sure , it 's not marked " copper " on the packaging , but everyone assumes they are getting copper wire and the manufacturer should know that and mark the packaging " aluminum . " If 14 gauge aluminum will work in your application , fine , then this wire is okay , but don't expect the performance of ordinary 14 gauge copper wire . I 'm giving it one star because I believe the manufacturer is trying to mislead us with copper-looking wire . I can imagine someone cutting this copper coated wire into several lengths , going to the trouble of soldering connectors , then realizing it 's not up to spec . They 'll then try to return the cut up wire and hear " but it doesn't say copper on the label and you already cut it . " What garbage .  
2	  I had been looking for a while on a good deal for a nice sized HDTV . I found this and the price was way below market competitors , plus it was a Samsung , which is great , I 'm all for their products . Great reliability and quality !  
2	  This battery has a super long use-life compared to the previous Canon battery that I had . I actually forgot my charger at my in-laws in January . It 's now April and I 've had to charge it twice ( luckily , a friend lets me borrow his charger ) . We use the camera all the time , too . One odd thing is that when I accidentally bump the battery cover on the camera , sometime the camera turns off and on again . Its a nuisance , but it doesn't happen enough for me to rate the item any lower than " I like it . "  
1	  This would have been a nice mouse if it continued to work properly . It worked fine for me for a little under a year and the click problem happened with me as well . I 've owned 2 intellimouse mice , and both have died out on me . I 've learned my lesson and purchased a logitech mouse , which has been working wonderfully . Also , if you intend to play a lot of PC games , the smooth scroll wheel isn't the best option . Get a click wheel with your mouse if you 're serious about playing games that rely on the wheel .  
1	  I 'd like to share my Seagate experience with anyone who is remotely considering purchasing a Seagate drive . I purchased a 250GB drive , it failed within 9 months . The first RMA drive I received from Seagate ( $ 20 my cost for shipping ) was Dead on Arrival . The second RMA drive I received from Seagate ( $ 20 my cost for shipping ) was Dead on Arrival . The third RMA drive I received from Seagate ( $ 20 my cost for shipping ) was Dead on Arrival . After complaining all the way up the corporate chain via " Community Relations " I received another refurbished RMA drive of a larger capacity ( 320GB ) . It worked .. for a while . I use the drive to run monthly backups . It 's in a USB enclosure and the drive failed roughly the sixth time I turned it on . I 've begun the complaint process with Seagate yet again , although I doubt it will lead anywhere . I 've also filed a complaint with my states Attorney General . I work in I.T. and Seagate used to mean quality , but no longer is this true . I 've done some research at work and it seems Seagate drives fail at more than twice the frequency of their competitors . RMA drives from Seagate have even worse reliability . If your data is important to you DO NOT place it on a Seagate disk drive .  
1	  I have been a dedicated Pentax shooter for over 30 years , using Pentax equipment for all my 35mm , 645 and 6X7 format applications . I loved the ergonomics , the incredible reliability and the uncomparable craftsmanship and optical quality of Pentax professional products - up until now . I 've purchased this lens brand new from Amazon and owned it for a year before giving up on it after the third and final replacement I got from Pentax due to horrible distortions , lack of sharpness and / or purple fringing I experienced with all three samples . I am still spending hours in Photoshop trying to salvage many compositionally great images I took with all three samples of this lens I owned . Some images can not be saved due to significant lack of sharpness ( this was the third sample I received - horrible autofocus errors in addition to fringing and distortion ) , but most are salvageable , since the distortions I experienced were mostly of a simple linear type , and are correctable in Photoshop , although the second sample of this lens had an incredibly complex wavy distortion patterns , which can not be corrected by regular means or by DxO software . The purple fringing is another matter entirely , taking hours of painstaking labor to remove and was prominently present in all three samples I had . This experience forced me to switch to Nikon for my wide-angle needs ( I purchased the horribly overpriced but optically unsurpassed 14-24mm lens for the D700 I was also obliged to purchase to use this lens ) , but I am using the now discontinued but simply incredible Pentax 645 and 6X7 lenses on the D700 from 35mm focal length and up via a mount adapter . I was forced to sell off my Pentax bodies , in part because their other current lenses also suffer from total lack of quality control . The bottom line - if you need a good quality wide angle lens for your Pentax , DO NOT BUY THIS LENS ! Consider a Tokina 11-16mm lens instead , which beats Pentax 's and every other manufacturer 's 12-24mm offerings hands down . It is very sad to see such a great optical designer and manufacturer as Pentax go down the drain ! I am giving this lens two stars instead of one , because the SMC Pentax coating performed flawlessly - no ghosting , even when shooting directly into the Sun ( do not try this with Nikon 14-24mm ! ) and because the physical build of this lens is great - solid , light and ergonomically superior .  
1	  I received this camera as an anniversary gift from my company . After taking several pictures at different resolutions and downloading to my laptop , I realized how poor the quality of the pictures were . Very grainy to be 3.0 MP . I have a 1.0 MP Kodak Easyshare camera that could run circles around this camera any day . When I viewed the pictures for this Oregon camera , if I didn't know better I would say they were taken with a camera phone . All I can say is thank god I didn't spend any money on this thing !  
2	  As has been mentioned before this are pretty good , don't like that they are flat . I use them for videogamos at night so I don't wake up the family . For this they work great . Got them as Gold Box deal of the day . Would buy again .  
2	  Once the repeater is up and running , it works very well . However , getting to that point is a nightmare - at least if you use WEP on your network . Basic rule : do not - repeat , DO NOT - press the autoconfig button . Which is unfortunately what I did , and it took me 45 minutes to fix the resulting mess . I am still not quite sure exactly what the problem is ( and in fact how I solved it ) . But it seems to be related to the fact that the range expander defaults to WEP-disabled . When you run the installation wizard and connect to your WEP-enabled router ( as per the manual ) , it can't find the repeater . I lost track of exactly what I was doing but after numerous rounds of resetting the expander and pulling the plug , it suddenly worked . Make sure you read previous reviews for details on some of the things to look out for , such as reconfigured IP settings , use of identical SSIDs , etc . I give it four stars because now that it is configured , it does work as advertised . But the installation is certainly not for the faint of heart , and judged by previous reviews , Customer Support doesn't seem to be very effective .  
1	  When I am playing non-film content , i.e. TV Shows or hybrid content ( interlaced + film ) , the video on the screen will flicker between most quick scene changes . I noticed it alot on " The Shield - Seasons 1 and 2 " and on DVDs burned from Tivo content . I know its not a bad player because I have 2 of these each bought at different times and they both have this exact same problem . I have a feeling that it has a hard time with interlaced content , since all hollywood movies ( film , 24fps ) plays just perfect . I could not find any settings on the player to help alleviate the problem . I am using the S-Video output . I have since switched to the new Philips 642 and this DVD player plays everything great , even divx discs . NOTE : The flicker I mentioned was caused by an incorrect setting . If you set the film mode correctly then it plays fine . So in retroscpect I would give this player a 4 star rating .  
1	  I bought this to use as a TTL flash with the Canon Rebel 2Ti I attached it to the hot shoe . The photos were either so bright they were washed out or they were blurry . I tried every setting , tried it with the display on , with the display off .. I see others used it successfully so the error may be mine but I googled endlessly , experimented repeatedly and finally just ordered the Canon Speedlite . If someone reading this has used this flash successfully with the 2Ti I would love to know the trick .  
1	  Is a 4154a picture ; you call it a 4153aWhich is it ? One drum has a 3 " roller . The other an 8 " roller .  
2	  This cable was perfect , it allowed me to add a fast Solid State Drive ( SSD ) to my 2010 IMac all in one . It worked perfectly and I have no complaints at all .  
2	  A while back I posted a not so flattering review of the Panasonic VDR-MD70 ; I thought that for the price the media was unreliable , user interface was lacking and video quality was inferior . This is the exact opposite ! For the price , the media ( about 1GB compact flash for the 60 min version ) is solid . It boots up in no time , has better picture quality and is about a quarter the price . The only problem I 've had is that it 's easy to overdrive / distort the sound if things are a bit loud . In a point and shoot video toy , a simple built in limiter would have been helpfull ( the only reason it 's not 5 stars ) . I don't use the digital zoom , I just move closer . We 've taken more footage with this thing in a couple of weeks than we did in over a year with the Panasonic . It 's not the tool for your next indie film , but for those quaint home snaps of the toddlers , it can't be beat .  
1	  The average selling 20 dollar boombox could out performe this hunk of junk . My little Bose Wave radio has a much better sound than this and a much more power than this . Don't buy it !  
2	  I have the previous model of this TV ( with lower resolution ) and the picture quality of this new model is much better even with non HD signals . The sound on this model is poor and will not satisfy anyone with any expectations of quality . The sound issues from a series of narrow slots that point downward towards a 45 degree bezel below the " Samsung " logo . The sound is like a cheap AM radio from the 1950 's and is mostly midrange biased . Even adding a $ 29 three way computer type speaker system made all the difference . The odd thing is that the previous model had a very acceptable sound system with multple speakers and lots of grill pointing at the listener . Needless to say , most buyers of this kind of TV will have or be adding an enhanced sound sytem . It 's too bad though that Samsung made it a complete necessity !  
1	  Isn't compatible with Windows 7 and Cisco online chat didn't seem to have another suggested product . I just bought a new printer instead !  
2	  I 've had numerous camera bags and hard cases over the years , but never a Backpack style bag . This one looked good with all of its adjustable compartments , pockets plus the backpack features . So , I got one and I 'm glad I did . This bag is in daily use , getting pulled in and out of the car , carried around , unzipped and zipped , on average six days / week , often everyday - I don't go anywhere without my cameras . I usually just carry it by grabbing the left side shoulder strap and slinging it on . After a lot of regular use , nothing is getting loose , ripped or pulled apart . I 'm amazed because I 'm not easy on it . I keep waiting to see a rip somewhere , expecially on that left shoulder strap , but it hasn't happened . Also , the zippers have proven very durable with no sign of wear or potential for separation . For anyone looking for a backpack style bag , this is it - Plus , it has CANON on it and if you 're a Canon Camera " fiend " , like I am , you just have to have a bag that proudly says CANON !  
1	  We got this about two years ago from Sam 's Club . It has been nothing but trouble . We returned the first system because it wouldn't read any discs . The second system has multiple problems : ( 1 ) It won't read the CDs or DVDs at least 50 % of the time . No kidding , sometimes I put 5 discs in there and it will cycle through all five and then finally say " NO DISC . " There is nothing wrong with the discs ; sometimes I can get them to work after multiple tries ( and sometimes not ) . ( 2 ) The surround sound usually does not work . My husband gave me a Post-It Note that we keep on the system with a series of steps we have to take to reset it so that the blue light comes on . ( 3 ) When they do work , the back speakers hiss . Even though Amazon no longer carries this unit I was searching to find out if there was any recall or anyone else with the same problems . We registered it on the Samsung website to see if they come up with a recall notice . ( We were about to dump our Canon digital camera recently when it stopped working - it was past warranty - but my husband found out it had a recall on it . They fixed it without charge . )  
1	  I 've had these headphones for just over a year and just like many of the other reviewers I thought these headphones were pretty great at first . My particular pair is the gunmetal variety and they definitely are really sleek looking . Sound QualityThe bass was a touch overpowering in contrast to all the other notes but as I work in a loud call center environment I preferred that . However as time goes on the bass quality degrades and now my right earbud has gone from full sound to low sound to finally none over a week . This probably occurred due to pulling them out via the wire but still , depressing non the less . ComfortThey had quite a few earbud sizes but for me they still manage to fall out every so often on me . OverallI can't really recommend these as I bought these a year ago and they 've already crapped out on me , disappointing overall .  
2	  I don't use this printer alot but when I do it does a great job considering the price . It has simple instructions which I like .  
2	  I bought this lens after returning the canon 75-300 that I was very unhappy with . This lens has impressed me every step of the way and yielded some excellent images . I highly recommend it . and if your on the fence like I was trying to decide if you need the IS or not . Just do it . you wont be sorry , My only regret was wasting my time with the non IS version . Click order and enjoy . You will thank me .  
1	  I bought this to replace the DVD player my kids use in the car . They watched a movie at home and it worked great . We were ALL excited it had two sets of headphones . They used it in the car to watch one movie and it worked fine . Then they went to watch another movie and it stopped playing about 10 minutes into the movie . The screen just froze and nothing would work . We changed DVDs and it gave an error message of " Wrong disc " . We tried disc after disc and it never worked again . I was going to get the same player again , b / c I really liked it , but upone further reflection , I think I won't buy this one again .  
2	  Im not an electronics whiz at the least . Friend suggested this for a low cost dependable power supply to go with new video card , I installed both myself ! which is amazing .. Very simple does its job pushing new video card , 0 problems so far since purchase in june / 09  
1	  Beautiful lamp and at a fantastic price .. too bad it only works right when it wants to . It sometimes comes right on , other times its almost as if I have to find that 1 centimeter touch zone in order for it to come on . Like I said , I guess you get what you pay for !  
1	  Had a mechanic install it , couldnt get it to work , and no tech support . Look in the paper , pay $ 129 installed .  
2	  I am enthusiastically ambivalent . These headphones sound GREAT . Not just good , but great . Although [ .. ] rated these badboys a notch or a half below Koss 's flagship portapros , I 'm having a hard time hearing the difference . As of this moment ( hey , I 've only had them for a few hours ) , they actually sound both slightly better and slightly worse . THE GOOD : 1 . Although Koss cans have a rep for being bassy ( albeit in a very controlled fashion ) , I find the sportapros to have a flatter response from low to hi than the portapros , which clearly emphasize the bass . THE BAD : 1 . The portapros have a clear edge in the mids and highs . No contest . The portapros create a larger , more realistic soundstage . They are also undeniably LOUDER than the sportapros . You 'll have to crank up the sports a bit to get optimal sound quality and volume . THE UGLY : 1 . These are hands down the UGLIEST , [ .. ] ugly , fugly ' phones you will ever see or wear . I took a look at the phones on my head , in the cooler more hip strap behind the head position , and my heart sank . You WILL look like Lando Calrissian 's assistant from The Empire Strikes Back ( that 's not a good thing , btw ) , whether you want to or not . CONCLUSION : 1 . outstanding sound for very little money . These are not true audiophile headphones , and neither are the portapros . The ports exaggerate bass albeit in controlled fashion , and the sports while having a flatter bass response , produces mids and highs which are not nearly as impressive . I 'll keep looking for the perfect price / performance / esthetics equation . Grados and Senns are up next ..  
2	  Having typed for over 50 years , I knew this would be a different experience because this keyboard breaks the mold to what I am usually & # 34 ; typing & # 34 ; on . Now that I have had it for a few weeks my fingers feel like they are home , no more strain on them or my hands and wrists . All the buttons on top make life much more user friendly .  
1	  i received a box with a completely empty package inside . ripped off . now i won't have the product for the event i was preparing for . do not order from these people .  
2	  This little laptop is a rare find at under 1000.00 . You get a good deal of power and it 's quite light weighing in at only 6.39 lbs . The price I paid was after 2 rebates , one from Compaq , the other from Circuit City . Out of the box it was easy to setup with a simple to read / use setup poster that describes each of the ports front / back and what the buttons on the inside are for . The keyboard is small and gets in the way at times , but fix that by adding a PS / 2 keyboard and you 're good to go . The RAM is shared with the Video memory , so you only get 240 MB of RAM , I imagine when RAM is cheaper for this notebook , I 'll upgrade to 384MB ( Maximum for this model ) . It comes with a 900 Mhz Duron ( which some say is better than a Celeron any day ) runs quite well , faster than my PII 550 Desktop any way . It comes with Windows XP and MS Works and some other poopy software , which I uninstalled so i could put what I wanted on it . Consider this if you purchase this machine you get : 900 Mhz Duron with 256MB PC133 SDRAM , a 20GB Hard drive , an 8x DVD , a 14.1 XGA TFT Active Matrix , a 4X AGP with VIA ProSavage KN1334 , JBL Pro Audio Speakers with Bass ReflexInputs / Outputs S-Video TV-Out , Headphone / Speaker-Out , Microphone-In , 2 USB Ports , an Ethernet Port , an Integrated V. 92 56 KBPS modem , a touchpad mouse , and Lithium-Ion battery that lasts 2.5 hours in good conditions ( not playing DVD 's or games ) . This is my first laptop and first Compaq , too and I 'm impressed !  
1	  I 've ordered these twice now . The first time was OK ; the second time I got a defective cartridge in the 2-pack . I just discovered it , since I haven't been printing huge amounts at home , and now it 's too late to send it back . Think I 'm going to spend the couple extra bucks to buy these at a chain store locally so I don't have to deal with this again .  
2	  This is my first digital camera bought after researching the web reviews . I took 16 pictures at a 4th of July parade and the results were fantastic . It 's easy to use the default mode and just point and shoot with excellent results of clarity and color saturation . I made 2 4x6 prints on my HP 932 and people couldn't believe these weren't photo lab quality . I tried the software on a Windows 95 computer and couldn't get it to work ( possibly no Windows 95 driver on the disk ) but my Windows ME with USB had no problem with fast downloads .  
1	  We got this printer for our office . This printer has a problem printing envelopes . When you print an envelope the envelope comes out wrinkled and sealed . I called HP customer service and they told me they had many complaints about this issue from other customers and that unfortunately there is no solution for it . They suggested to upgrade the printer for some other model . The price of the model they suggested was $ 1,200 . We had to return the printer and get another brand . Don't recommend .  
2	  Yes . Ofcourse , awesome bass ! But for the settings on my iPod I decided to have the extra bass but if you dont want it , all you have to do is adjust your settings and it is not as powerful . In my opinion , I dont think it overpowers everything at all , it has an awesome sound of all parts of the spectrum even when you adjust it to have high bass . The only problem I have been having is with its durability . The sound quality is topnotch , but the durability doesnt go along with it . The headphones have fell apart , and the wire is not very durable and pretty flimsy . My first pair had both problems so when I purchased them again , I took precaution and added some sturdy tape to areas where I felt needed and thats done the trick .  
1	  I now have two terastations sitting on the shelf collecting dust . I bought the terastation live 2tb because of the attractive price . I placed the NAS on a 1 gigabit network with a few macs for clients . I reviewed the manuals and the admin interface and optimized for the mac environment as instructed . The resulting , optimized , file transfer speeds were so slow as to be unworkable for anything other than late night backups . After a few days I purchased a readynas ( also through amazon ) and have found this to be a * much * faster system . Definitely consider this issue before you buy .  
2	  It is just plug and play for Window Vista . Working perfect and competitive price .  
1	  I had two expectations when purchasing this product : 1 . They would sound like crap , as one would reasonably assume of $ 10 headphones2 . They would stay in my ears while runningThe first expectation was passed with flying colors . Fortunately I 'm not looking for audiophile enlightenment while burning off a couple beers on the jogging path , so not a big deal there . The second expectation was a total failure though . Three runs in , these were unable to stay in or attached to my ears for more than 30 seconds . Frustrating junk , look elsewhere for running headphones .  
1	  This hard drive gets very hot , very quickly , and then start to fail , I bought it half and a year ago , and I don't use it so much , but now is failing in the big way :( I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY THIS HARD DRIVE , at least you want to lose some files .. it get bad sectors now .. and I have 4 drives more of different capacities an none of those drives failed .. but this is the new one , and the worst .. don't ever buy it .. or you will sorry in a future .. I don't get advice of all reviews and now I 'm paying for it . :'( .. My drive : Western Digital 500GB 3.5 " , SATA , 16MB Cache Bulk / OEM Hard Drive WD5000AAKS  
1	  Well .. I 'll just say that I have had better experiences with new computers . I like the form factor and the cool yellow color but Ubuntu is simply a pain in the neck . I can understand that some Linux enthusists might like twiddling with Ubuntu , but I don't . I sent it back and ordered something else . The camera was flaky and wireless is a hassle on any variant of Linux . When I buy a new computer , I want something that works out of the box , not a science project . I ended up going with the Asus Eee with XP - and it is everything I wanted and more . I bought a second Eee for my sister in law and she is equally delighted .  
2	  We have the 1022 at work in a few places - that has a couple of buttons , this one is even more stripped down , but for $ 64 , it 's a great home printer . I was so fed up with inkjet printers , since we don't print that much , and they are always getting clogged , etc , not to mention eating up ink ( which dries out and you have to waste more of it cleaning the heads ) . Two different " photo printers " left us feeling like it was cheaper and easier to print photos with online services , and most of what 's left is printing regular text - web pages , homework for the kids , etc . If you need a printer that does clear B & W , for standard household stuff , this is the one to get . Simple USB connection , it works , and no fuss .  
1	  Pros - scans have pretty good qualityCons - stopped working after several uses and gave several errors . Troubleshooting with Canon did not resolve this issue . The device had to be returned . - did not work with Mac OSX and not supported by Linux SANE ( Scanner Access Now Easy ) project . Comments : overall , a no bells and whistles scanner with limited compatibility . I would be happy to keep it .. if it actually worked !  
1	  The first one that I received did not work at all . Just plain dead out of the box . No big problem , I got a replacement from Amazon and returned the non-functional one . The replacement functioned well . Good sound quality , good signal strength , easy to tune . But , after 7 months of use , the second one died as well . It 'll work for 10-20 seconds and then stop working ( lights go out , stops transmitting ; have to unplug it , let it sit , and then plug it back in to get it to come back on for another 10-20 seconds ) .  
1	  Product was $ 2.50 , shipping was $ 7.50 . I have a 2004 4Runner w / CD / tape . This product works well for about 1 song and then quickly gets grainy , full of static and poor sound quality . For $ 10 I thought that I would gamble and hopefully come up a winner . Keep your $ . The thing is junk . I don't know why it works for a moment and then doesn't but it 's frustrating and fiddling with it while driving is just plain dangerous .  
1	  1 . Tuning Problems : Beware of this product . My $ 25 Grundig pocket radio outperformsit ! I live in Boston which admittedly is full of radio signal overlap . So okay its a little harder to tune a radio station here . This productdoes as bad a job of tuning as any I have ever seen . The signalleakage is all over the dial . It gets about 4 stations clearly in alocation that has hundreds of stations . 2 . Using it for IPod speakers : It is a very clean looking design but as far as using it for ipodplayback remember that it doesn't have any remote controlfeatures or playback info so you are restricted to turning youripod on and letting it play away . You better really believethat life is random ;-)  
1	  This drive started off badly and quickly got worse . When I insert a movie DVD into the drive , it will kick it out EIGHT times before playing it . This happens EVERY SINGLE time , since it was new . Blank DVDs are only a little less obnoxious : I have to erase any disk before recording , even if it 's new . Finally a year after I bought this thing it quit working entirely . I gleefully smashed it to pieces , which is the only pleasure I ever got from this totally nasty Sony product . This is definitely my last Sony product . Not only did Sony choose to install computer cracker rootkits each time you play one of their CDs , but now even the hardware side of the company has become infected withe same customer loathing for which the media side of Sony has become infamous . That 's it . The end . No more Sony for me .  
1	  I purchased the Belkin F3U133-6 Pro Series USB 2.0 A / B Cable and HAD PROBLEMS WITH IT FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY . I asked my Help Desk to determine the problem rather than instantly requesting a replacement . After confirming my equipment was not the problem , they advised me to seek a replacement as the cord is faulty . I came in on a Sunday ( 12/02 ) to call Amazon and request a replacement . They informed me that they would not consider my request because the return window closed on 11/30 ( Fri ) . Customer Service refused to make good on a $ 6 item .. sad . I wish I could rate the cable , but I was never able to use it ! I would have been thrilled to post something positive for Belkin . I am an honest customer and have purchased thousands of dollars on Amazon . com for the past two years . But , if Amazon feels it is worth losing a loyal customer because of two calendar days , then I feel it is important to start shopping somewhere else !  
2	  This is a good product . Though I needed an adoptor for the mouse to work on our system it is has been great . The key board is a little big , which makes it somewhat ackward to carry around it sits well in a lap and its short cut keys are helpful . Overall very satisified with product and expremely pleased with the price .  
2	  I must start by saying that I bought this monitor merely based on online reviews , technical specs and Samsung 's reputation for quality monitors . First of all you get 8ms response rate which makes it great for all video multimedia options , I have a similar Samsung with 20ms response rate and you can really tell a difference when watching movies / playing , in other words , if you are planning to use your monitor for other things appart from normal office work , this might be the right choice for you . Important highlights : 1 ) The self adjusting system works great , it is quite fast and will adapt your screen resolution to your video source , also will adjust screen settings . I hate when you need to keep on adjusting your monitor if you have dark backgrounds , low resolution videos , etc . 2 ) It has excellent picture quality , can reproduce bright colors very close to a CRT . 3 ) Easy installation : I run Win XP and it took a couple of clicks and 5 minutes to get it all working in order ( however it comes with advance setup options and I enjoyed creating setting profiles for very specific needs which demand the best picture ) . 4 ) Reliability , the market of LCD monitors hasn't still being able to offer a good enough warranty policty ( that 's my opinion ) , normally you could have up to 3 dead pixels and still wouldn't be able to return your monitor , that is both frustrating and annoying to eyesight . So , the best we can do is to hope on the reliability of brands and Samsung has proven this to me for the 4th time with LCD screens . The only drawback I could think of is that this monitor is not the most good looking one in the market , it has very sober aesthetics , but I already knew what to expect as I saw all the pictures available from Amazon . Regarding buying from Amazon , everything went just fine with time of delivery , however the tracking system didn't seem to work .  
1	  I bought 2 while I was in the US and unfortunately the do not fit in the in Germany and after I bought an adapter they did not work . Both did not deliver the correct voltage .  
1	  This camera is a worthless p . o . s . if purchased refurbished . I cannot vouch for a new one , however ..  
2	  I could not be happier . EASY TO USE , SOLID QUALITY / RELIABLE PERFOMANCE  
1	  I received one of these for christmas . The Item turned on perfectly , but thats about all it did perfectly . It gave me " map not found " right out of the box . I contacted Magellans pathetic customer support . When they finally replied , they told me I was basically out of luck , that they dont service this model anymore , and I could send it back and purchase a different model at a resonable rate ! Cripes ! I got the stupid piece of junk for Christmas , why in the heck would I want to spend money on another one of their Items when this one didn't even work out of the box . The bottom line is , I got a new paperweight for christmas . This Item could be fixed with a service update and they know it . Do yourself a favor , do not purchase anything from Magellan . Customer support is terrible . Product support is non-existant . Always remember .. Get a .. get a .. get a GARMIN !  
1	  Even though my HP printer manual says this should work with an iPad , it doesn't recognize the HP 6310 All-in-One Officejet printer . Therefore I feel like my money was wasted unless someone can tell me what went wrong .  
2	  I love this thing . I have both a block-rocker and a tail-gater . We use them for our wedding business , and have never had a problem with either , despite hauling them all over the place in our van and using them on the beach . They are reasonably priced , good quality , and easy to use . The block rocker is a little heavy to really carry around ( though it does have wheels and a handle ) , but the tail gater doesn't pack enough punch ( audio wise ) for large outdoor gatherings . So I wish they made something in between . But otherwise I love them both . In fact , I am logged on right now to order another one of each for one of our other offices ! UPDATE : After a year or two , the rechargable batteries tend to die . This is not a flaw - I suppose it 's to be expected . I just wanted to point out you can remove the four screws from the side of the unit , take out the battery , and get a new one from any Radio Shack or Batteries Plus - then you 're good to go for another year or two ! If you have one that is over a year old and you need it to be reliable ( i.e. for a business or special events ) you may want to go ahead and replace the battery , or at least buy a new battery and have the spare on hand for a quick change-out .  
1	  The keyboard lags terribley . It will barely work if you have it too close to the wireless reciever . The Mouse lags terribley . You absolutely cannot play computer games with this or you will want to break your computer . Maybe I just got a bad one though .. other than that , everything else is fine .  
1	  - The scanner worked for maybe a week and will not reinstall . - The paper tray started jamming on a regular basis ( meaning page by page ) after a few months . - The computer was reading the ink cartridge as an improper product for my printer shortly after I started using it ( yes it was the one that came with the machine ) . - The printer head broke twice - once on my original printer and one on the refurbished one . That 's twice in 9 months . - It required one unanswered email to HP support and three phone calls to get anything done about these problems , and the refurbished printer didn't scan from day one . Positives : - HP had no problem replacing the printer when they found out the print head was broken . - HP mailed me replacement ink cartridges for free when they found out their faulty hardware corrupted it . I have been costing HP more money in customer support and replacement parts than I paid for the machine . If I hadn't been using this machine to print out my senior thesis I would think it 's funny . Plus their customer support is out of the US so it helps the economy !  
1	  Not sure who was the designer of this trackball , but it causes finger cramps and my discomfort in the button locations lead to more hand aches . Would not recommend this .  
1	  I recently bought this unit at Sears ( i 'm returning it tomorrow ) after reading great reviews from Amazon . I also have recently used the Mio c310x , which was great but it wasn't mine so I decided to buy my own but a different one . One of the few things that bothered me with this unit is the loading time could sometimes take forever . And lastly , searching for POI 's doesn't really search what you actually look for . It also searches anything while you are typing which is annoying because it would lag or slow down because its loading searches . The maps are also not updatable , not that you would every week but it would be a nice feature . I don't see how Dual could get seriously into the GPS business . The ONLY thing i like about this gps is the way that its designed . Not very many gps gets designed a different way . Also a plus is the 2 led indicators ( the ones on the side of the unit ) of where you need to go , left and right . It is a cool idea but when you 're driving while the sun is out , you barely notice it because its not very bright at all . Overall I would have to say its an OK gps . I would definitely recommend testing this out FIRST before you buy it .  
1	  The wireless card works fine in a laptop however the Router will not work with an SBC modem . The router has the same IP address as the modem which makes it impossible to address . So it is no good if you have an SBC high speed connection with their modem . Tech support has been less than helpful since they don't speak much english . They work from a list that has very little to do with the problem . I don't recommend that anyone with SBC hight speed internet purchase this product .  
1	  It seems that AudioVox stopped making these years ago . But they sit on the shelves of many shops , just rotting and waiting . The one I bought was completely dead . No continuity , no signal , nothing . I can't even get a sat meter to register background noise when I try to power this up . If you buy one , be sure to test it right away . Don't wait like I did until the " product return window " closed .  
2	  Product has been working fine for a month , so I have no complaints about it . Friend set up , so can't comment on ease of set up .  
2	  I bought the Canon Speedlight 580EX II flash to use with my new Canon 50D camera with a Canon EF 100-400mm f4.5-5.6L IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens , but nobody told me that this lens is too large and the light of the flash don't reach the subject without a bracket . But with the bracket you also need a cord to connect the flash to the camera ( in my case , a Canon OC-E3 or equivalent ) . So I wanted to share this information to help other people that are planning to get a similar equipment .  
1	  I bought this mouse , and it worked great for a day or two and then quit . I echanged it for another and it doesn't work either . The manual says it will work with a PS2 / Serial adapter but apparently not . I threw the box away the first day when it worked , so now I 'm stuck with a dead mouse . Stay away from this one .  
2	  I purchased this TV in 2/05 . I was initially unimpressed with the picture quality . In standard definition cable signal the picture can appear to varying degrees , a bit out of focus and fuzzy . I was very concerned and called customer service to have the TV looked at . They were very helpful and located a local repair center for me so that I could then call to schedule an in home appointment . I later learned that HDTV 's are designed to show there best picture with an HDTV signal . So I upgraded my cable service to HDTV . It made a tremendous difference when viewing a program on an HDTV channel . In high definition the picture is crystal clear with excellent brightness and color . Sound quality is very impressive even when at maximum volume ( no distortion ) . The theatre type sound effect can be improved with the addition of a surround sound system but it is not needed . One minor fault , I was not able to get the TV Guide feature to work as a previous writer had mentioned  
1	  I ordered this product from Wholesale LapTop Battery and paid extra for quick shipping . The item took over a week to arrive . I can only imagine how long regular shipping takes . The item worked as advertised for approximately two months and then began to work intermittently . At two and a half months it stopped working completely . This power supply was used in one location and was never moved .  
2	  Fast Charging , reliable , a MUST HAVE if you own a Digital Elph . I also couldn't believe how affordable it was either . You can pay up to $ 50 for other charger / battery combos !  
1	  The video quality is nowhere near what I expected and I am disapointed enough to return it . Its got a good swivel and thats about it ; the content that comes with it is so-so and the headset is pretty minimal .  
1	  I bought this item , used it for awhile and it worked OK . When I went to change PCs it didn't work anymore . No manual or drivers on the Logitech website because the product has been discontinued . How could they not support a product that is still on the shelves ? That 's the last Logitech product I 'll ever buy .  
2	  I have four of these . I work out of the home and have flakey power . I have a Windows PC , Linux Server , DSL modem , router and wireless access point in several different rooms . Every time the power would blip I would have to wait for all of this equipment to reset / reboot before I could get back to work and I would lose whatever I was working on last . Although these don't have much power they do keep me up in the blips and give me enough time to shut every thing down properly in case the outage is longer than a blip . A pretty cheap solution that works great .  
1	  These units do not have installation instructions and the website requires you to be a profesional registered installer to get any information .  
1	  I specifically searched for FOCUS brand cartridges when I was directed to this seller . I always use FOCUS brand and have not had many problems . I received my order today and was extremely disappointed that the cartridges I ordered were in fact not FOCUS brand . I have had bad luck with other re-manufactured cartridges and feel that advertising the FOCUS brand logo provides the customer with a false sense of the product . I will make sure not to order from this seller again in the future !  
1	  Total crap for paper craft . not strong enough at all , very high water content . stay away - this is not a glue pen - this is a glue stick .  
2	  Having been hooked up via a Netgear hub for the past two years , I wondered if I could gain any networking improvements by installing a switch . I was concerned by some articles relating to their ' configuration ' however . Well , as one reviewer has already said , " it took longer to take it out of the box than to install it ! " . Hooked up the four workgroup PCs and VOILA .. everything just came back up as though nothing had been altered , EXCEPT for the new SPEED ! Don't hesitate on buying this little beauty !  
1	  Sadly , this printer would not work with specialized legal software that is dos based . After several hours working with the support tech at the software company and NEC support it was determined by both that this computer could not print from this software . We have been using an NEC SuperScript 660i very successfully and attempted to upgrade to the 1400 and retire the 660i . For other programs it is probably wonderful .  
1	  My husband bought me this camera ten months ago as an early Christmas present . While the picture quality is not the greatest , I have found it to take decent photos for the price . It is easy to use , although , like all point-and-shoot cameras , it is at times difficult to get a clear picture due to unsteady hands . My major complaint about this camera is the cheap build . My husband accidentally dropped the camera from about five inches off the ground , where he caught it before it made full impact . Still , the camera will no longer turn on . When I contacted Kodak , I was told that it would cost $ 90 to repair , which is nearly what my husband paid for it in the first place . I am considering their service upgrade deal where you turn in a broken camera for a discounted new one , but after this one broke so easily , I am unsure that I want to spend the money on another Kodak just to have it break like the first one . While the camera takes decent pictures , it has shoddy workmanship and poor materials and can break upon even the smallest impact , and the cost to repair it is simply not worth it . Edit : My mother was able to wiggle some parts in the battery compartment to make it work again .  
1	  Greatly improves shortwave reception . Much better than using just the telescoping whip antenna on your shortwave radio . The problem is , it has a habit of getting stuck pretty often when winding the wire back into its case . You 'll need to pull all the wire out and start over again . I 've never had this problem before with the Sangean ANT-60 , a similar retractable antenna that costs a little more but is made with a better rotating mechanism .  
1	  I strongly urge you to NOT BUY THIS MACHINE ! You have to replace the drum unit every 3-4 toners . They told me this at Brother after I bought my printer and it started splotching after the 4th toner .  
2	  How much can you say about a cable ? This one is well made , the snagless ends are pretty , well , snagless . When we hooked it up it just worked . Everything one would expect from this cable .  
2	  I bought this camera in February for a trip to Europe . The pictures were sharp . The colors were accurate . Unfortunately , I needed service , but Kodak did a fast , great job . I bought the 128MB compact flash card , which gives me about 200 pictures in top quality .  
1	  No Support from either Veo or Xirlink & we had big Trouble with the 6mb internal memory of the camera . We sent numerous emailsand wrote letters to Xirlink and Veo . No one seems to care ! We never heard from anyone ; so we can only advise that youare on your own when it comes to customer support . We had chronic problems with the 6 MB internal memory on thecamera and could get no pics from it . But when we addedthe SD memory card , we were able to get it to work . It'san average camera and produces some pretty good pics , butdon't expect too much . It has no flash , but we got somepretty cool pics at a concert where the performer was in the spotlight . But you won't get any pics with room light . Don'tthink you can wear it on your keychain though , as theyadvertise . It 's made of cheap plastic and you 'll see thatit 's a pretty fragile camera that even needs to be protected . It 's pretty sad , though , that they don't care about theircustomers . And for that reason , we can't recommend thiscamera .  
1	  This computer is awesome when it comes to power , mobility , and exterior design . At 4.7 lbs . , it is very light . Of all the centrinos out there , this is definitely the most eye catching . The only problem is that it can destroy the eyes as well . The native resolution for this computer is 1400x1050 which is great if you are a graphic designer . However , for those of us that use a computer to surf the web or type up documents , the resolution is unreasonable since text and graphics are almost 50 % smaller compared to other 14.1 " screens out there . Sony should have kept the native resolution at 1024x768 like most other computer manufacturers .. this would prevent one from having to squint at the screen . One can manually change the screen 's resolution to 1024x768 but since it 's not native , details get blurred and text becomes fuzzy . I will return mine and wait till Sony releases a lower resolution version for real world users .. I really wish I could keep it , but squinting at the screen can get tiresome .  
2	  I ordered this Daewoo DTQ19V1FC 19 " Color TV January 16 , 2006 and had it sent to California as a belated Christmas presentThey are still using it and I have had no complaints from them about itWould buy it again  
2	  The Panasonic headset is comfortable , easy to use and has excellent sound . While not expensive , so far this headset is the best one I have owned and I would buy another without hesitation .  
1	  This product worked for one day with my phone at work and then the static set in . The customers calling in could not hear me because of all the static but I couldn't hear anything . Not to mention that when it did work the volume was way too low . I will be sending this product back .  
2	  A PREVIOUS LISTED REVIEW STATED THAT IT DID NOT WORK FOR THEIR CAMERA , THE Z740 . YOU DO NEED THE 45.5mm-55mm ADAPTER THAT COMES WITH YOUR CAMERA . I HAVE THE Z650 AND IT WORKS FINE WITH THE ADAPTER . GREAT PRICE FOR THE PRODUCT ALSO .  
2	  This order came quickly and the case works great . It is a little big for my laptop , but I think the next size down would have been too small .  
1	  My problem was not the charger , yet , but instead a " wrong disc " error no matter what DVD is in the player . On the other hand , CD 's work fine . I contacted the company through an e-mail I found on their website , CustomerService @ kgiproducts . com . They in turn told me to contact their repair company , Lasonic at 323.222.9889 . So , I can ship it to Lasonic in Los Angeles with a $ 20 check for repair and then they 'll ship it back in a few weeks . This thing is so heavy , it would cost me a furtune to insure ship it ! I can't even get the battery off to make it lighter ! It would be cheaper for me to buy a new unit than to have this one fixed , especially now that I 'm reading here how many more problems I have to look forward to . What a rip-off !  
2	  This backpack bag holds everything for me . I had read other reviews about the build and size but for me it 's perfect . I don't have any problem with quality of the build nor the size . I feel it 's any excellent product for the price . It holds my Canon 20D with 100-400mm IS USM lens with hood with room to spare . I also carry 70-300mm IS USM , 28-135 IS USM , kit lens , and a 580ex Speedlite . It has outside pockets perfect for filters and storge inside for memory cards and a lot more . I think it 's a great buy .  
1	  I have to use this printer at my work and I am counting the days for it to be replaced with ANYTHING else . This printer is a nightmare . It jams constantly , tearing off the sheets is a pain to do . I do not have one positive thing to say about this printer , if you need something like it , search elsewhere . Avoid this printer at ALL COSTS .  
1	  I 'll leave the extensive reviews to the more talkative . It 's a printer . Once installed , it works well . Ink is expensive . Photos fade just a bit over time . It ejects paper like a ninja flings daggers . What I really want to review is the driver install . Current Progress : Checking Hardware 0 % Overall Progress : Checking System ( Step 1/4 ) 0 % So far , 30 minutes elapsed . I expect the complete driver install to take a few hours . Yeah , seriously . No , nothing is wrong with my system . My nearby Brother HL-5250DN has a 2 megabyte driver . It installs in 20 seconds . ( The Brother is a * great * bw laser printer if you happen to be in the market . Feature packed and a speed demon . ) Meanwhile , the HP 3180 " driver only " software weighs in at a hefty FORTY SEVEN MEGABYTES . Hopefully it 's doing something useful for someone . Because I have no freaking clue what it 's working on . Maybe it 's looking for interesting fourier transforms in deep space signals accumulated by idle radio telescopes . Or maybe it 's figuring out denaturization of protein folding caused by carcinogens . Whatever it is , it 's taking its sweet time doing it .  
2	  I have several other lenses with $ 50 + filters on them but since the lens this went on is inexpensive I didn't want to spend too much on it . It is clear and comes in factory package . Well worth the money for the protection . No noticeable distortion or clarity issues either so that makes filter even better . Do yourself a favor and always protect your lenses since a filter costs so much less than a lens and is easy to replace .  
1	  I used an HDMI cable to hook up the Philips DVP5900 DVD player to my brand new Philips 42 " widescreen plasma TV . Unbelievably a bright green stripe appears down the right side of the display on the TV regardless of what DVD I play . The stripe varies from as much as half an inch in width to almost nothing . I thought the issue was possibly related to the player simply warming up , but I 've had it on for three hours , and while the stripe starts out wide , and then shrinks to almost nothing at times , it does come back . I can't enjoy a picture which has a bright green stripe of varying width coming and going along the right side of the display . I 've e-mailed Philips twice regarding the issue and received no response , and the problem is not mentioned on their online support page . I checked the available firmware upgrade online too , and there is no mention of the issue or any fix for it . I saw another review where the user refers to a green bar , so apparently it 's not just my player-though it probably is related to the HDMI hookup and the use of a widescreen TV ( i.e. , you might not experience the problem with different equipment and a different connection-I just don't know ) . While I 'm here I 'd like to suggest strongly to Philips that if they 're going to sell their wares in the US market they rewrite their manuals and online support documents in comprehensible business English , dispensing of the mangled grammar , misspelled and missing words that tend to make it hard to figure out what 's meant at times . I 'm returning the player to Amazon , and apologize to them for wasting their time on this one . I 'd suggest they consider not selling this player unless there 's a resolution of this issue . CORRECTION , as of 2/6/06 : I wrote an updated review , but the system wouldn't allow me to enter a second review of the same product , only to edit this original review , so I 've added the update below : I wrote the earlier 1/14/06 review suggesting this DVD player was possibly faulty because of the bright green stripe that appeared down the right side of the display on my plasma HDTV . Since then I 've replaced the player with a highly rated Sony HDMI player .. and the green stripe has appeared again , though only about half the width-perhaps a quarter of an inch wide . So the fault must be with the TV and not the DVD player . I 've checked the Philips online support documents for the TV , and there is a document that mentions the picture can be off-center when using an HDMI connection , though it doesn't refer to any green stripe on the right side . What I 've found out in the meantime is that the TV 's picture format can be set to a fixed widescreen display when using a DVD , instead of the default automatic format , which will stretch the picture to fit the screen , and is useful when watching TV . The other night I watched the entirety of National Treasure ( a film I can highly recommend ) with the TV itself set to the widescreen format , and there was no issue with any green stripe . ( The National Treasure DVD was also in the widescreen format by the way-it was not the full screen version . ) My apologies for the earlier review , but then it would have helped if Philips had responded to my questions or had online support that addressed the issue . I don't think the Philips DVD picture quality was that different from what I 've seen with this new Sony player , so this Philips player might work for you .  
2	  This uv filter works fine - on my Sony a100 ! The Panasonic DMC 30FZ I bought it for on the accessories part of amazon recommended it and it is not the right size for that . I guess everyone but me knows to double check the small accessories that amazon says go with a unit . Taught me to be more careful , at least , when I 'm buying adapters , batteries , etc , have not had a problem since . By the way , it 's a good quality filter !  
1	  Got theses for an old camcorder , The batteries work fine for about five months then they started to leak .. ughh waste of $ # 1  
2	  Good Product . Good Price . Good Performance . Excellent Delivery Time . Unbelievable Low Price and Free Shipping . What more can you say ?  
1	  I bought this for my roku 2 . When I hook it up green flickering lines appeared in my TV screen and that ` s about it ! The cable is so skinny it can ` t handle the signal strength thus it doesn ` t work . Buyer beware !  
1	  The webcam is a total failure . The pictures are not clear at all . People can't even recognize me at the other end of video chat . I have returned it . I bought another iHome webcam from the bookstore almost of the same price , the pic quality is much better .  
1	  Ordered this item based on Magellan website and because it was just what I needed for my Explorer XL GPS - please note picture of item has 3 suction cups , I received an old outdated model that looked like a Martian antenna with a Huge single suction cup . Despite numerous telephone calls to Amazon , they could not get the right product . To date they have sent me 4 items - all incorrect ! I received promises of actual inventory checking , a review by the catalog dept . , and promises by various customer service people to resolve this situation for me , for Amazon , and for other potential buyers . They still have no clue . I received my first item in 01/07 and my fourth in 05/07 and just got my refunds straightened out this week ( 05/24/07 ) . This is the worst experience I have ever had with a company and I have spent many thousands of dollars with Amazon . I never expect that these events will come to closure .  
1	  I ordered these to work with a manual KVM switch . Video ghosted very badly using these cables . I know it 's not the switch box because I 've hooked up cables from a Tripp-Lite electronic switch I previously ordered and they do not ghost , neither on the electronic or manual switch . If you 're using a manual KVM switch box avoid these .  
1	  I want to give a fair review on this product but I must say it seems Amazon could have done a much better job securing the package . When it was sent the antenna box was not taped . All it had to secure it was the strings that wrap around plastic buttons to hold the box together . So the product may have been damaged in shipment but Amazon could not send another for me to try as at the time they were out of stock . I tried the product with and without the amplifier and noticed absolutely no difference . I tried it in different places in my home as well . It just did not work for me at all . Sent it back for a refund . I still have not found a good antenna .  
2	  This TV is phenomenal , the picture is incredible , it looks great and it 's not that heavy . I have my PS3 , X-box 360 and Wii all connected to this tv and it 's so simple to switch in between them . I also used it as a computer monitor and Oh MY GOD ! Counterstrike on a 1920x1080 resolution is insane ! Probably the best TV I have ever owned . I also suggest getting 5.1 speakers for this TV because the TV has a problem with bass . It tends to overpower the speakers so get what I got , Logitech 5.1 Z-5500 = Amazing . I highly recommend it and buy it from NEWEGG it 's 850 bucks in Total , fast shipping and great service .  
1	  I had nothing but problems with my new camera . First it would just shut off for no reason , the zoom could not find its mark kept adjusting while just sitting on table and finally the flash would rapid misfire & message would say BUSY up to 3 minutes after one shot . I was hoping this camera would be the one for me . I guess I just got a bad one after reading all positive reviews . Reluctantly I had to return it . That also was Canon 's support agent suggestion too . I am glad I bought it from Amazon since they are real good about defective returns .  
2	  This product was received within 5 days of placing my order . It was received as pictured and just what i needed to get my camera working again !  
2	  The sound quality is good but not fabulous . The biggest problem is the hissing sound . But they do reduce noise . It 's not just covering up the noise with the hiss . If you wear them with the power turned on , and no music playing , you can definitely hear outside noises get much quieter . They completely block out sounds of things like cars and buses and air conditioners . And I would estimate that they cancel half of the noise on a jetliner . But for listening to music in a quiet environment they are not so great , because of the hiss . Despite the flaws , they are the lowest priced noise canceling phones I could find , and they do cancel noise very well , so I gave them a 4 .  
1	  I bought this because it was an MP3 player with wi-fi , I thought it would be a good alternative to my iPod touch and I could give that to my apple loving brother . I had no idea your getting useless wifi with no keyboard or touchscreen . So you can't access the internet at all . Why give a product wi-fi if it can't be used for internet browsing ? I think iPod is an overly expensive brand ; and there is no reason this wouldn't be better than an iPod nano or shuffle ; but the iPod touch is actually useful at places that offer wi fi , like McDonald 's or Starbucks if you need information off of the internet . ( email , directions , get a hotel , make a phone call with skype ) Do not buy this product as a competitor for an iPod touch , buy it as a mp3 player you can get cheaply ; closest comparison is to Sony Walkman .  
2	  This is the best IR to RF converter I have purchased and I have had a few . It allowed me to get rid of a couple of cable boxes and still allows me to change channels from anywhere in the house including on the deck outside . At $ 8 a month per box it will pay for it 's self in a few months . Also works well with my stereo equipment . Has a very good range of view .  
1	  Although the unit indicated it had power and was linked to the network the set-up software could not find it . I will have spent $ 16 and hours of frustration by the time I ship it back . Tech support was useless .  
2	  I bought this for my 3 young daughters to use on several long plane rides . I had no problems with it at all . It was easy enough for them to figure out without the need of a remote ( something else for them to lose ) . The battery lasted well over 3 hours on each trip . This unit has two headphone jacks so all you need is a splitter in order to have 3 sets of headphones hooked up . Picture and sound are great . I highly recommend this unit .  
2	  My mother received the first T.V. and it was badly damaged . Dependable Resource was outstanding in preparing to send a new one , but UPS did a very bad job of arranging pickup of the damaged T.V. As soon as UPS picked up the bad T.V. , my mother received a replacement in a couple of days and she was very happy with the product . Thumbs Up Dependable Resource ! Thumbs Down UPS !  
1	  Just bought the camera a couple hours ago and now im packaging it back up to return . Looking at the camera , it seems like a good buy with the mp3 player and 5 mp but the pictures just come out horrible . The mp3 functions seems to work good . Would not recommend at all waste of money .  
1	  I bought the WDT11 and it seemed to work fine except that my computer would no longer perform a RESTART ( W2K ) after installation unless I unplugged the WPC11 from it . Linksys tech support was clueless as to the cause of the problem , and could not help except to exchange the unit . Of course the replacement did not allow a restart either . The downgrade is not necessarily for the unit so much as for the cluelessness of Linksys support . I have Dell hardware , so it 's not as if I am running rogue hardware ! I can SHUTDOWN and reboot normally , however .  
2	  I believe the new and old Zune are both better than the iPod Classic or Video iPods for several reasons ( especially after the firmware update ) : 1 . Zune can sync via Wi-Fi2 . " All you can eat " Zune pass . For those who buy multiple cds a month and cycle through cds quite frequently , this is an awesome option - $ 15 / month3 . Large bright screen4 . Navigation is even better than iPod5 . Has a more durable build6 . The new Zune comes with premium ear-buds7 . Ability to share music with friends who also have a Zune8 . Has a built-in FM radio  
2	  The 8GB SDHC arrived on the last day of promissed in the original package . I installed it in my Canon camera and stated to shoot pictures it 's realy great to have this SD card in my camera I can now shoot more pictures and videos for a very long time .  
1	  Whoa .. it was broken out of the box . The plastic trim window over the display came off with the protective clear wrap around the music player . I super glued it back on . The whole unit feels cheap and weakly built . The " gun metal " finish scratches * very * easily . The buttons " miss , " by that I mean that pressing the next button might trigger the play / pause button instead of next . The menu system is marginal considering the player has 7 buttons on the face . The player has a 2.5MM jack instead of a 3.5MM jack , so now I have to dig up an adapter because it is not mentioned in the item description . I would not have purchased it based on that fact alone . Quite honestly the manufacturer could have easily put a standard jack into the player . I have not had a chance to verify battery life as I just got the package today . There are positives . File transfer is snappy , the screen is easily read , the FM function works well with the right headphones ( the headphone cord acts as the antenna . ) FM record seems a useless feature , but that is simply my opinion . Voice recording quality is selectable ( 3 quality settings ) and functions well enough to take quick mental notes but it would take you a minute to get there . I bought this for gym use , so I guess I will see how well it goes , but I do consider it disposable at this point due to the poor build quality . There are MUCH better products available for only a few dollars more . I highly recommend finding a different player . My advice : call a friend .  
1	  Updated firmware on the PDA ( iPaq 3765 ) . Updated firmware on access point . Updated driver for WCF12 . Plenty of quality time with tech support . But in the end WCF12 is unreliable . WEP flat does not work . Never worked . Not even once . ( MAC filtering is alternative ) Cool when it works , but sooner or later it will [ have an error ] and require a hard reset ( = > re-install apps , data , drivers ) before it will work again . I am returning for PC card + new iPaq PC card sleeve . Hoping for better results .  
2	  This Lexmark is approximately my seventh Ink Jet Printer . I have had good success with the others , but this new Lexmark is the fastest and best thus far . In addition , the FAX capability is phenominal . I serve on a Governor 's committee and in the past have had to drive to review cases for my input . With my new Lexmark I have the pleasure of staying home and have the documents faxed to me and it is amazing the clarity and speed that it has . I have had some experience with Lexmark printers as my wife has one that came with her computer . After years of use , she too has had success and no problems . The others all worked fine , but my new Lexmark works excellently . I recommend consideration of this model when replacement time comes .  
2	  What the cable companies provide in 1Ghz cheapo coaxial splitters is insufficient to get the best TV picture quality , particularly if one has several coaxial cable connections relating to TV 's and broadband internet . I found in using the increased bandwidth of the Monster splitters of 2Ghz having improved the sharpness of analog and digital cable TV reception . Additionally , as more people are opting for HDTV sets and broadband internet connectivity , reducing signal loss will provide one potential improvement relating to multiple connections . Other issues relate to dirty AC power interference and the quality of the cabling used , ( such as superior performance in S-Video or composite cables ) , so the solution to maximize your signal quality is multifaceted . It is recommended to use either the 2 or 3 splitter variation . The 4-splitter model has more signal loss . Use the splitters at the entry point and where one splits coax between the TV and other components such as DVD / DVR 's .  
1	  This camera is really a bad one from the canon . I have bought other canon cameras those were excellent but this particular camera frustrated me as it costs me my attention , time and money for nothing  
1	  You would think that Panasonic Cordless phone and Panasonic Hands-Free Headset would work well together , being that they are sold by the same company . Well , that is clearly not the case . I bought this headset specifically for the reason that it is sold by Panasonic to work with their cordless phones . I 've tried it a few times and each time I get the same response from the person I 'm talking to . They say I sound too far away , that they can barely hear me . This product is clearly not worth it .  
1	  This is not even close to the quality of the original battery . Barely holds a charge after using it for several months .  
1	  It could be a good unit but : 1 ) As others mentioned with the normal sound setting , the volume is way too low , even for headphones . And with headphones attached , there is a very loud background noise ( hiss ) generated by the on-board speakers . 2 ) I also noticed ( at least in the unit I had ) that the sound mix was heavy towards the left channel , i.e. the center sounds were not exactly center . I tested this with many DVDs and had the same bad result . Annoying . 3 ) The battery is way too bulky for a portable . All these companies should show their units with the battery pack as well before you buy them . The Panasonic models have such a smaller profile . 4 ) Even with all the good on-paper video specs I found the picture not as warm . Again , I think the Panasonics imho seem better . So , I think I 'll be returning mine and taking a look at the Panasonice DVD-LA95 instead .  
2	  I purchased this carrying case not for a tripod , but for the Orion 120mm Refractor Telescope . It is a perfect fit ! The case is well padded , and the side pocket is convenient for small accessories . I am very confident in its ability to protect my telescope .  
2	  The ION iTTUSB05 USB Turntable is very easy to use . It came with a dust cover , cueing arm , and easy to use software . It was up and running in 10 minutes . We were spinning vynl that had not been spun for 25 to 30 years . We had a great time . Using iTunes burning to a CD was simple and straight forward . There is other software for more advanced users , Audacity , which we have not used yet . Well worth the investment or gift giving .  
2	  These are terrific headphones for their sound quality and the microphone . I absolutely love the sound they produce . The bass is very deep ( perhaps too deep for some - but it 's the way I like my music :) and highs are good as well . They can be a little uncomfortable because the earpads press against your ears too much .  
2	  Came in the package brand new . Plugs right in and there 's no setup involved . Just plug it into your car lighter , set the frequency , and change your car radio to that station to hear all your own music . There is some slight background static at certain volumes , but it 's nothing that takes away from the experience .  
1	  I have this router for a few months and its wireless performance is terrible . File transfer speeds are about 5 times lower then on my previous SMC router . In addition - wireless connectivity break daily for no apparent reason , and since wired connections keep working at the same time I cannot blame my provider .  
1	  This is a decent sub-1Megapixel camera if you aren't too concerned about color . It doesn't get colors right at all . Plus , the time to process a picture is way too long . Don't use the included software for the camera - go to the Largan web site and download the twain driver . Additionally , the pictures are always overexposed with the flash . My advice ; don't bother .  
2	  I absolutely love this mouse . It fits comfortably in my hand . Just the right size for travel . The functionality is not too sensitive and I like the fact that you can interchange the function assigments . I also like the scroll to enlarge feature . A lot of times the print on articles is very tiny . I rate this mouse a " 5 " !  
1	  I bought this KVM based on the Amazon reviews . This was the fist KVM that I have owned that didn't have a hot key to switch between computers , but I thought that would be OK for a better quility KVM . This KVM was very poor and would loose the video setting ever 2 or 3 times I would switch between computers . It would take me from my high res setting back down to a old VGA mode of display and my display would be a mess and would only clear up after a reboot of the computer . There are far better KVMs for about half of this cost , and that do the job far better then this box does .  
1	  For a cheap product my expectations were low but not nearly low enough . These headphones were unusable . The headset is so narrow it felt like they were pinching my head and caused the cuffs to put way too much , pressure on my ears . I am a very small woman so it isn't as if I have an enormous noggin . My ears hurt the whole time I was wearing these and after only an hour my ears were hurting so much I had to take the headset off . Also , the braided cable touching my shirt created a lot of noise in the headset .  
1	  I highly recommend you not to buy this as this doesnt have any extra storage space . Even power adapter case is quite snuggly and I am repenting buying this item . I cant even store my ipod in this case . The finishing of the product is smooth and leather quality is descent . But its not multipurpose .  
1	  This is a good radio / CD player with a major inexcusable design flaw . There is no battery so if you lose power , you lose the time . How Sony made an alarm clock without thinking of this I don't understand .  
2	  I have used this as model in both wired and wireless modes for several months with never a glitch . Easy setup with clear menus and clear explanations of each feature . It 's styling is a bit simple , but considering the speed and ease of use is the one to get . BIG PLUS : it allows you to assign a static IP using DHCP to each MAC address in your network .. most competitors don't have this on similarly priced models .  
2	  I own these cables , they are perfect . People need to read the directions . Nobody seems to realize that each component tip loosens up if you twist it counter-clockwise . These component cables are threaded . Unscrew them , they slip right on to the connection , then tighten them back up by screwing them clockwise again . Ive used these for over a year now , and the quality is amazing .  
1	  The Colorado Map series does not display the same detail as a real 1/24000 official USGS map . I wonder which Colorado maps that National Geographic scanned ? Hopefully I might be able to use the GPS and way points with my Garmin GPS 72 , however the software setup does not list the Garmin GPS 72 . I must have received last years version .  
2	  so when i order i feel ok that its not a fake orderhard to put it onyes to my frends  
1	  bought this one for a trip to NY . I was very disappointed because it blocked a blind spot on my right . Returning the item to Best Buy and looking for a better one .  
2	  I bought these at wallmart .. was trying to find some phones that would sound very good but wouldnt allow other sounds in and would not break after a few months of use .. my fav before these were sony earbuds . they had damn good base and good overall sound but would get the cloth covers dammaged and then got ear wax clogged after a while and the wires would break .. so i got these .. i hated them at first due to the fact that bass sounded like A $ .. but after pressing them to my ears with my fingers .. WOW they sounded fantastic and could handle some impressive volume .. so i got me some head bands from the doller store to wear over the speaker sections of these to have them held to my ears while listening .. they sound great that way .. they are cheap and sound great once you press emCheers  
1	  Bose 901 's have a very odd response curve , and the active equalizer is a specialized preamp of sorts to smooth out the sound and emphasize the low and top end . For some strange reason Bose hasn't gone digital with this preamp . Its 100 % analog . A pre-out loop needs to be available on your amp before you can set it up properly . The amp also should be a plain stereo amp , since the equalizer shapes the sound so much that if you connect a 2nd set of speakers ( b-channel ) they will sound very harsh and could even damage them . You get 2 slides , mid-bass and mid-treble . There 's also a low bass cutoff button , and not much else . The unit is rather large for what it does , and is an odd size that takes up more room in your stereo cabinet than it should .  
2	  I upgraded from a 10/100 switch to this D-Link DGS-2208 about a month ago and I love it ! Moving DVD ISO images from one computer to another is now much faster ( of course , both computers have gigabit nics ) . The switch was always the choke point in the process but not any more .  
1	  yes , for 99 bucks the ipod shuffles does seem like a steal , but apple needs to stop portraying their products as simply ' disposable ' . E-waste is a serious issue and the fact that apple continues to produce and create new ipods that have irreplaceble batteries is not helping . it is not ok that if your ipod dies , u can simply throw it away and purchase a new one " for only $ 99 . " it does not make sense that apple charges you to replace the battery , nor does it make sense that they charge you if you want your ipod ' properly disposed of ' . please visit this site and learn how you can help : ww . badapple . bizi agree , apple is producing some of the coolest products ever , but why cant they do so while taking the problem of e-waste into consideration ?  
1	  I bought this router because I wanted better range and higher speed in my house . Well I got the speed , but not the range and a whole bunch of additional headaches on top . The Positives - the speed is undoubtedly there for our wireless devices . Apps load data faster on iPhones , laptops run better , no question . But that 's all i can find to be happy with . The Negatives - The range is no better than my old D-LINK Wireless G Air Plus router . I wanted extended range so my iPhone would get a stronger Wi-Fi signal in my basement , but it 's really no different . But the biggest headache was setting up my wireless HP printer . It took me 5 DAYS ( ! ) to get the router and printer to communicate . And I ended up using some cunning with my old D-Link router to get it work . The issue appeared to be a common one too - one which I could find no solution to on the web . Thank goodness I 'm IT savvy . It also frequently seems to not recognize wireless devices it once did and I have to unplug it for around 30 seconds then power it back up again to get it to work . You also appear to have to do this if you change a setting in it 's configuration options for the new setting to take effect . If you 're looking for a Wireless N router , I 'd suggest looking somewhere else .  
1	  Epson Picture Mate Deluxe Viewer Edition Photo Printer Item shipped incorrectly and because of that the item was scratched up quite badly . It also did not come with the right cords in order to see if the product even works . I am unable to test this product and am disappointed in the sellers attempt to prevent me from operating this machine . She attempted to send another cord , it does not fit this machine . I cannot believe someone who owned this machine would not know what is needed to operate this machine . Disgusted at this point that I have ink and paper I purchased at the time as this machine and yet now need to look for the appropriate cords and USB equipment to even test this equipment . No battery with item  
1	  If you are looking for a digital camera that work well . Than this is not one that you are looking for . The product might be cool and portable . But please do not buy it ! When I might 2 days ago it was $ 30 but it was on sale for $ 20 . So I bought it and I almost open it . But if I open it I won't be able to return it . So I went to see some reviews on the net . And found out it was a stinking digital camera ! So be like me and don't buy it ! Unless you can get it for free . Aim me at Animeprincessx2 if u have questions !  
2	  The speakers work even better than I expected the sound is clear and crisp and the experience is great .  
1	  This didn't work . The program I am using it for crashes when I select the COM port that this thing is emulating . It 's better just to buy the PCI card with serial ports on it .  
2	  Good product . Very economical . Highly recommend having a UV filiter to protect your lens glass from damage . Tiffen filters are very good quality .  
2	  I was in a rush to replace a worn out unit . After searching through the local retailers , I found Amazon . com had this product for a fraction of the local price . It arrived within a few days and works great . I have learned to regularly check whatever I need at Amazon . com first for price comparisons . Warren Petracek ( Denver , CO )  
1	  I bought this TV for my mother as a holiday gift . She is 67 years old and needed assistance in setting it up ; to which I was much obliged to do . While I was lowering the TV onto the stand the TV slipped off of the stand and very nearly sliced open my finger to the bone . Suffice to say it ruined our holiday , and I guarantee that if my hand met such a misfortune that there are other people that have suffered my same fate . The back of the TV has a thin steel frame that hugs the top part of the mounting , the steel is so thin that if it is dropped on your hand be prepared for instant gouging . It is a good TV as far as the picture , however the unit itself was not designed with safety in mind . I have a 52 inch LCD Sony Bravia that was lighter to carry and easier to lower onto the stand , and has a better picture . I am hoping that my finger heals quickly ; for those with the spirit of adventure feel free to look at the photos of my incident . Best of luck to all ! Photos :[ .. ]  
1	  Logitech 's Wireless Music System was easy to set up ( granted you 've used your USB port on your computer before , and plugged inputs into the back of your receiver / stereo before ) . Bought it for my parents , because my mom is always frustrated with the interference she gets with her favorite classical radio stations . Their PC , running XP , had no hesitation accepting the little device , I just plugged it in and after a restart , it was broadcasting their computer 's sounds . The receiver device was easy as well . Took me a moment to coordinate the volume control on the computer with the volume control on the Logitech receiver and the volume control on their stereo - so there wouldn't be a dramatic volume change switching from the Logitech input to others . Mom was thrilled . Then it just quit . The little USB device just didn't power up . No issue with the computer . Drag . Buy something that perhaps costs more but sold by a company with a better reliability track record than Logitech .  
2	  After I could not get either of two different Linksys E-3000 routers to connect to my notebook at speeds faster then 65Mbps , I sent them back for refund and bought this D-Link at half the price . Right out of the box it connected to the laptop at 150Mbps just as other DLink routers have done . No fuss , no muss , no hours on chat sessions and the phone getting excuses like at Cisco ; it just WORKS !  
2	  It was a gift to my grandson . No complaints so far . Robert H  
2	  I bought zune for my boys for christmas . We set it up that day , it was so easy to use . They down load music so fast . Both boys are very happy with all of the features .  
1	  We got this printer to handle all our printing needs for a typical family home that takes a lot of digital photos but doesn't print out very many . Since we don't have a lot of printing needs - occasional web pages , office documents and infrequent photos - the printer sits idle for the majority of the time . Every time we go to print photos it 's an hour-long ordeal of cleaning the print heads , printing test pages , burning through an amazing amount of ink - just for a couple photos for friends and family . Even for occasional web documents , if the printer 's been idle for any amount of time , the colors are completely inaccurate , the tints are off and the quality is fuzzy . This printer is capable of printing top-notch quality photos , but if you 're expecting a printer that will sit there and be ready for you whenever you want it to go , you 'll be disappointed . If you 're printing photos every day , you might find this a better printer . My family and I have decided , however , to get a better quality photo-specific printer in the future . Until then , we print photos from online services and are very happy with the results .  
2	  When I was deciding on which 19 inch monitor to pick I did not base my opinion only on the reviews and experiences of other people . I decided to look at all the monitors that I thought were excellent or very good monitors ( Samsung , Viewsonic , NEC , Philips , Sony ) . I went to my nearest retailer 's and checked out their current displays . I was welcomed by the Viewsonic 19 inch monitors and was astonished by the Sony 19 inch monitor . The Samsung 19 inch monitors were not as impressive as I heard they were . I could not find any Philips displays . But I did notice one monitor that had both sharp text and rich clear graphics ( Mitsubishi DP930 ) . Its image was as smooth looking as the Viewsonic monitors with a hint of sharpness and slightly richer in color . What amazed me was that no other monitor compared to it except the Sony 19 inch monitor ( which was very $ ) . I later found out that the Mitsubishi DP930 and the NEC FP912SB were the same monitors . Playing games and watching movies were excellent , but I did not get to do any image editing as yet . I highly recommend this monitor for its sharp text and very good graphics and image quality . I recommend you use the Naviset software to adjust the monitors settings .  
2	  I purchased four of these so I can put books on them for my mother in law . We found even with her poor vision she can read the screen to select chapters , a feature not in my old shuffle and at a good price . They work very good , can be loaded by my MAC or PC and have a fine FM radio . Give them a try .  
2	  Note : I 'm rating this four stars because I haven't even gotten the lens yet , but I want to make the point that , after some pretty exhaustive online research to try to confirm this , it LOOKS like Sigma is now making the Sony version of this lens WITH HSM . You can't believe how difficult it has been trying to find two sites that agree on this , but as far as I can tell , Sigma 's press releases in a few places tout the new DG version of this lens as having HSM for all the usual suspects , and " Konica Minolta " ( i.e. Sony ) as a compatible HSM lens . I 'll try to provide more information on the lens itself when it actually arrives ( notably , I want better information about shooting with this lens in a sports capacity . There are maybe 20 people in the country who are able to make a living shooting sports as their specialty , but it would be really nice to include an ability to shoot night-time high-school football with this pup as a newspaper stringer , to help justify buying the thing ) .  
1	  The KX-FLB751 on paper has all that you could want . Fax at 33.6 kbps , laser printing , scanner and copier . However , it is very noisy with lots of loud clicking while printing . Also , it does not scan in color . Functionally , it seems to be working fine after one month 's use . It also has an attractive physical appearance . Just one of those devices that needed a little more tweaking before being released . Perhaps the next model will correct the above .  
1	  After 14 mos . picture went black . My husband got service manual and could not fix . Took to a local repair shop , can't find problem . Next may try a Panasonic service center , but at least 1-2 hrs . away . Enjoyed picture for 14 mos . , but not worth $ 500 paid at CCity !  
2	  Why doesn't Canon change their design to this cap I don't know . All I know is this is great for people who keep their hoods on the camera . I have a big enough pack to where I can always keep my hoods on the glass . Since I have a 24-70 F2.8 and a 70-200 F2.8 , both have decently sized hoods and with these Tamron lens caps , I can keep the hood on and take on / off the caps . These are cheap enough that I find the convenience helpful . If the current stock caps don't bother you , then you have no use for these .  
1	  If you want to listen to music and never want to expose it to the weather or the gym its probably fine . But it took only three trips to the gym and it died . I did have it in a protective cover but just the little sweat on my hands after the workout when I turned it off was too much . My Nano has being going strong for months .  
2	  Every since I blew my money on the Creative 5700 5.1 system , I 've been looking for an excuse to buy a new system ( because I really regret getting the 5700 's ) . I looked at the Klipsch , and listened to them at Best Buy , but I wasn't very impressed ; especially considering the price tag . Although the Z-680 is actually sold for the same price as the Promedia , they completely annihalate the Klipsch in terms of quality ! I 've never heard such clean and precise sound in a computer speaker system . These speakers are almost as good as a Bose or JBL home theater system ( and half the price , too ) . The subwoofer is an impressive 188 watts , so even when the volume is cranked , these babies still put out very clean , undistorted sound . Although when the volume and the subwoofer level is at full , distortion can be heard , but I 'm not sure if that 's the approaching limits of the speakers or of my ears . So whether you listen to music , watch DVD 's , play games , or all of the above , these speakers are sure to kick major a $ at doing it ! This is the first product I 've given a full five stars to , and Logitech really earned it !  
2	  Bought this battery as a spare and was not disappointed ( even though I took the Canon battery to the limit ) This battery fit fine in the Canon charger and the camera . For the price I would highly recommend it as a backup . Even if you never use it for 12 bucks you can't go wrong .  
2	  I bought this speaker together with a pair of L830s for my home theater and I couldn't be happier . Very nice and crisp sound with all the highs and deep lows !  
1	  This ZIP drive worked fine for a while and then just ceased to function so I returned the drive to Iomega for a replacement . The .. unit that was sent worked " OK " , at best , with occasional glitches ( an especially annoying " churning " of the drive as it attempts to recognize the disk ) . This unit finally ceased to function as well , drive isn't recognized at all . I 've given up and will search for another alternative to this product .  
2	  Works fine , 8GB capacity , and the price is right , I 'm working with the first set of photos right now .  
2	  The people at Canon have really done a beautiful job making a very beginner-friendly D-SLR . Right out of the box , I was able to take beautiful , frame-worthy photos of my children . The value was amazing . Compared to other brands , the Rebel XT far outshone the rest at this price . I generally use this one as a " point-and-shoot . " I really like the fact that it takes the photos of my two small children ( just turned two , and ten months old ) INSTANTLY . Digital point-and-shoots take so long that the girls have moved by the time the camera takes the picture ! Overall , great value for the price , great beginner camera all around . I 'm impressed .  
1	  Fine keyboard , exactly what I expected . I was replacing a similar keyboard where the letters had worn off the keys . Guess what ? Withing six months an even worse problem ( letters wearing off on the keys ) with this keyboard ! NOT recommended !  
1	  If they weren't free , I 'd give them 1 star . Media code : MCC 01RG20 . 2 of 10 were coasters at 4X with my DVDRW IDE1008 .  
1	  I had my unit for a year and the plastic hinge broke . I recommend getting and using the optional leather carrying case at all times because it helps protect the hinge somewhat . My hinge broke after a day I was carrying around my gps unit but didn't have my leather case with me . However I think the hinge started getting more loose after about 9 months of use because the flip cover started falling off my pda occaisionaly after about 9 months of use . Even when using the leather case you 'll still want to use the flip cover . The leather case is softer and if you don't have the flip cover on inside the case there a good chace your unit 's on button will get pressed on inside your pocket and the pda battery will get drained . The flip case is more rigid and it helps prevent the on button from accidently getting turned on while you are carring the pda inside the leather case .  
2	  Previously , I had been projecting on my white wall in my bed room ( ViewSonic Pro8200 ) . At first , I didn't have any issues or complaints . Key words : " At first . " Slowly , but surely , the texture of my walls grew from goose-bumps to valleys and peaks on panning scenes . The light over-spray from Pro8200 seemingly began to be the only thing that I saw . Something had to be done . So I purchased the ezCinema Plus ( F100XWH1 ) . It was an instant remedy for the panning images . The black borders completely eliminated the over-spray of light . Furthermore , the ezCinema Plus corrected an issue that I didn't even know that I had : color accuracy . Scenes are bright , vivid , and have great contrast . I now place this screen in front of my closet , well , because I can . The scissor-backed mechanism in the back is easy , quick , and sturdy . I 'd recommend this screen to my mother , and that 's saying a lot !  
2	  I always trust Logitech to make good PC peripherals . I 've got all Logitech game conrollers , mice , keyboards and on one PC , even the speakers . Although the Logitech headphones suck , the mice are top notch . It is accurate and comfortable . Only downside is that sometimes the scoll wheel goes crazy and scrolls too much or very sporadically but that is rare . A terrific mouse . I use it for daily use .  
1	  Purchased the AD-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it . The most recent is that it will stop responding to the on / off button . The light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever . I end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when I try again it will work fine .. at least until this problem arises again . I 've registered this unit at ww . apexdigialinc . com and listed the problem . They claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply . I 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an RA with no response . I 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you . Once I actually got to an answering machine and left a message . Still no response . I will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the BB .  
1	  I was very disappointed in this picture frame . While this frame does have a very high resolution , it has virtually NO side viewing angle . If you aren't staring at it directly face on , then it starts to get overly-bright and washed out , or overly dark and difficult to see - depending on the angle you are viewing it at . It also has difficulty choosing the correct orientation for a picture . If you edit the pictures in an image editor - like Photoshop - then it seems to get them right . But straight out of a camera it often gives you a " sideways " photo in the frame . There is also a design problem with the Compact Flash card slot . It is very finicky and if you even slightly misalign the card as you are inserting it into the frame , it can fall into the sealed back of the frame . This is VERY easy to do , and I was fortunate to be able to get my card to fall back out of the slot . But it is a design flaw that had to be apparent to any testers and easily fixed by enclosing the slot so that the card couldn't fall through . Westinghouse apparently decided that this was just something we would have to deal with . Finally , it arrived with a bright blue " dead pixel " in the center of the screen . This was not noticable on bright , " busy " pictures , but it stood out like a sore thumb on dark pictures and particularly on flesh-toned scenes - like , well - you know - people 's faces . As a comparison , I also own the Matsunichi frame which has been flawless . I expected more from a company like Westinghouse . There are better frames out there . ONE OTHER NOTE : BEWARE - if you order this through Amazon but actually purchase it through Electronics Express , you have an entirely different ( and worse ) return policy which even though the product might be defective , requires you to pay shipping and limits your returns to 15 days . Look carefully before you order - if it isn't from AMAZON then you are probably up a creek if there are problems .  
2	  This a low tech little gadget that don't take up a lot of space and it works !  
1	  The only good thing about the Zune is the amount of gigs for the price . The software will prompt you to update which will mess up your music library . You can find the fix on the forum , but it is a lot of work to fix . Many of the Zune owners including myself have had trouble with the players resetting during listening . There is no fix yet for this . There are many types of issues with the Zune and its all models not just this one . I honestly wish I had bought an IPOD . If there is no resetting fix by next year I am buying an IPOD . Sorry Zune , I wanted to like you .  
1	  I purchased this camera as a travel camera to take on an upcoming trip . My other camera is a Nikon D80 . I read lots of reviews for the Canon point & shoot cameras and decided to give this one a try because of the image stabilization . This is my first Canon camera since my old 35mm Canon Snappy . I 've taken it out on a couple of shoots before our trip . Pros :* Very small and light , easy to carry around . * Takes regular AA batteries which is great if your rechargable batteries run out of juice during a trip . I do recommend buying high quality rechargables though . * Produces very vivid colors which equal great photos . * Has image stabilizer which is a very nice feature in a camera under $ 150 ! Cons :* The time it takes to get ready between shots with the flash is waay too long . By the time it is ready again , the moment has passed or the subjects have moved on or changed their expressions because of the long wait .. " oh hang on .. just a minute .. stay right there .. " That doesn't work . * Very close to impossible to see the screen in sunlight ( even with a glare reducer / protective film ) . No problem one might say , there is a viewfinder .. see next con .. * The viewfinder is not true to what you actually take a picture of .. useless if you are zooming for sure ! * No battery life indicator that I have found . I wouldn't buy this particular camera if I had it to do over again for my needs . I also had a problem with it right out of the box ( an apparent spec of dust is inside the lens which requires shipping it to Canon to be fixed .. not a very good start for me with my Canon experience ) . The customer service guy at Canon was very nice however . It should take about 10 days to 2 weeks to get the camera back . It was purchased to take on a trip this weekend so all of the pictures will have a dust spec shadow in them . To me , the importance of the cons outweighs the importance of the pros . Most cameras today do take great pictures . The viewfinder is basically useless and the screen is too hard to see outdoors . No matter how vivid and nice the pictures are capable of being , if you can't frame your picture and even make sure the subject is in the picture because you can't see the viewfinder in the light .. what 's the point ? If you are going to use this mostly in overcast or indoor shots , it would be great and that is where the image stablization comes in handy but then you have to wait for the flash . If you have to use the flash much , patience is required because you can't take more than one fast . If I did it all over again , I wouldn't get this camera simply because it doesn't fit with my needs . I 'm sure others are very happy with it and that 's great . Hopefully after I get back from our trip and have it repaired , I 'll learn to like it too . I 'm a huge online shopper but I would buy locally next time so that if there was a problem ( like I have with the lens issue ) , I could return it directly to the store for an exchange . I won't purchase another camera from an online store but I will give Canon another try one day .  
2	  After doing a lot of research on both XM and Sirius , I chose Sirius and so far I 've been thrilled with the service as well as this product . Two main reasons the scales tipped to Sirius ' favor was 1 ) Clear Channel has a stake in XM Radio , and at first XM was just playing recorded loops of Clear Channel programming , until recently , and 2 ) The sports options with Sirius is much better . Sirius has broadcasting deals with the NFL , NBA , and NHL , while XM only has exclusive rights to NASCAR.I 've known Audiovox to be a low-end brand for a while but this has been solid for me so far . The display is bright and easy to read , there 's a choice of display fonts . Little did I know that the remote that comes with it is a big plus depending on where you may need to site the unit in your car or home .  
2	  Not much to say here that hasn't already been said .. outstanding quality sound for the cost ( I got these for under ten bucks ) . They feel like quality buds , but also maybe a bit delicate as well . I can't speak to the durability , but at this price , it is more than worth it . If I am going to do something that breaks these buds , then it would also probably break a more expensive pair as well . For the price , they can't be beat .  
2	  Great lens . Be aware that it is a DT lens and therefore will only work on APS-C sensors . Basically , if you are never going to shoot old Minolta 35mm SLRs or the upcoming A900 body ( $ 2500 + probably ) , don't worry about it . Best Buy had this on sale , free shipping , for $ 400 early Feb . 2008 . So look for that number or lower on this lens for best price .  
2	  After I read some reviews on this site I was kind of scared to buy the product . I live in NYC and would be doing a lot of walking and what not with it and skipping would be a big problem . I bought it anyway and am definately not sorry . I walk all over New York and up and down the subway and it has never skipped once i don't even have the ESP on . I keep the player vertical in my jacket pocket and walk freely with it even if it is jarred it won't skip . I updated to firmware version 1.12 and really enjoy the new features such as directory hierarchy and resume . It has always read every file i have put on disc and has read every id3 tag . I am VERY VERY happy with this product and am looking at buying one for my spouse as well . Buy this and you won't be sorry .  
2	  I used iGuidance 1.0 for the Pocket PC for over 4 years before I got the Garmin n & uuml ; vi 360 . I loved the iGuidance but the Garmin n & uuml ; vi 360 blew me away ! Accuracy-The n & uuml ; vi is very accurate ; it has yet to fail to bring me to my destination . However , I 've encountered a few instances where an address or road wasn't in the n & uuml ; vi database - and I have the most current ( 2009 ) maps . In such cases , your best bet would be to simply enter an adjacent or nearby location into the n & uuml ; vi . Directions-The software lets you know how far ahead your next turn is when you 're within between about . 1 to . 5 miles . It says something like " In . 1 miles , turn left onto Broadway " and a few hundred feet before your turn , it omits the information on the distance before your turn and simply says " Turn left onto Broadway . " I wish it used feet instead of miles when specifying distances . 2 mile ( 1056 ft ) or less but it 's a minor complaint . The software gives you the directions for two successive turns that are very close together ( say , 300 feet apart ) all at once to make sure you have ample time to respond to the second turn that immediately follows the first . For example , " Take exit 70 , then keep left " , or " Turn right , then immediately turn left . " However , it may occasionally notify you of a turn a little late , which results in you missing the turn . Thankfully , this doesn't happen very often . If you do miss a turn , however , the software recalculates a new route very quickly ( within a couple of seconds ) ! Auto-Off / Resume Function-My Garmin is a permanent fixture in my car . I leave the car adapter permanently hooked up to the unit . What I really love about it is it automatically turns off when the external power supply is lost . What this translates to is whenever I turn off my car engine , the unit automatically shuts itself off . When I start my car , the unit automatically fires back up . It gets better - it remembers your set destination when it turns back on and resumes giving you directions to your destination . This feature is handy for when I need to fill up on gas midway to a destination . After I 'm done filling up my tank , I start my car , at which point the GPS unit fires back up and immediately resumes giving me directions to my destination . Very cool ! This makes the Garmin n & uuml ; vi the perfect In-Car GPS solution ! Data Entry-The keys for entering addresses into the n & uuml ; vi are arranged alphabetically from A-Z , not in a QWERTY format . Personally , I find the tedium of having to hunt for letters in the A-Z format a real inconvenience and annoyance ! Lock It-You can lock your n & uuml ; vi with a 4-digit PIN . The package comes with 2 decals that state that your GPS unit is secured with a security code to deter would-be thieves from stealing the unit . Text To Speech The text to speech still sounds like it comes from a synthesized voice but it 's perfectly intelligible . Multi-Point Routing-Even though Multi-Point Routing is NOT an intended feature on the n & uuml ; vi 360 , it doesn't mean the n & uuml ; vi isn't _ capable _ of Multi-Point Routing . Here 's how it 's accomplished : Say , you want to go from point A to point D via point B and point C. ( i ) You want to first set the destination to point D. ( ii ) Then , once again , you set the destination a second time , this time to point C. You will receive the following prompt from the software asking " Insert as via point ? " , which essentially means : Do you want to overwrite the destination you 've set in step ( i ) , i.e. the point D destination or do you want to go to point D VIA point C. Answer YES . ( ii ) Yet again , set the destination a third time to point B. Answer YES when prompted whether you want to " Insert as via point ? " There you have it , the n & uuml ; vi is going to take you from point A to point D VIA points B and C. It 's a clumsy roundabout way of getting the n & uuml ; vi 360 to do Multi-Point Routing , but it can be done . Nice Extras - SD card SlotSince the unit can serve as an MP3 Player and a photo viewer , it has an SD card slot allows you to load mp3 and photos ( JPEG ) onto the unit . - MP3 PlayerThe MP3 Player is very basic . It has shuffle and repeat track / playlist . The unit will only read mp3 files in the root directory of the SD card ; it will not read mp3 files that are in a folder . It will , however , read playlist ( pls ) files , which can have their source from one or more folders / sub folders . There are other limitations to the mp3 player :( i ) you cannot delete tracks ( ii ) you cannot arrange / edit your playlistsTo edit / delete your tracks or playlists , you will need to do so in your computer , mobile device , or music device . - Picture ViewerYou can load your photos via the SD card slot and view it on the screen . - Bluetooth Phone HookupI 'm , unfortunately , still using a cell phone that 's doesn't have Bluetooth ( it 's one of those antiquated phones reminiscent of the cell phones from the 90 's ) so I 'm unable to test this feature . But I 'm able to tell you it 's a feature that allows you to hook up your phone to the GPS unit via Bluetooth so you can use the GPS unit as a handsfree console . Now , that 's pretty nifty . Conclusion-The Garmin n & uuml ; vi 360 is a very affordable In-Car GPS Solution . Apart from the cumbersome interface ( A-Z keys ) for entering your destination , I really don't have very much else to complain about it . Highly recommended !  
2	  Unlike * all * the other manufacturers out there who seem to have been blind-sided by the advent of Windows Vista , this Bluetooth transceiver works right out of the box . Just be aware that their in-box installation documentation needs to be updated and download their latest drivers from their web site . ( Trust me , I have done a lot of research , and none of the other manufacturers have so much as Vista drivers ! )  
2	  This bag is just the right size to carry my SLR with lense attached , plus my zoom lens and my speedlight . The pocket in the front can hold additional small items like your battery or some cards . I 'll be using this bag on hikes , rather than my laarger bag which tends to be too much for hiking . Very sturdy construction !  
1	  I took it back after a few minutes . For a cam that costs $ 50 , both the SOUND and VIDEO quality was terrible and grainy . I installed it correctly and I use Windows XP . Should have no problem but it was a major disappointment . .. the CREATIVE LIVE ! CAM which was only $ 29 works a LOT better . Bottom line-Mcrosoft LifeCam VX-3000 has both BAD PICTURES , and BAD SOUND . You have been warned .  
2	  All and all , I am very please with the Brother MFC-420CN . It was an excellent price for all the features . I think I 've tried all of the features and they work as exepected . I must admit that I did not have high performance expectations and do not plan on using the printer for serious photo printing . The only real complaint that I have about the product is the software installation . I received errors on both computers and had to manually resolve them . Luckily I am a very experienced computer user so this was not a big deal but anyone that is not as comfortable may want to think twice as it could get kind of hairy . Once installed , I was able to quickly discover and use all of the functions ( expect fax as I don't have it hooked up to my phone line yet ) easily . I 've copied , scanned , printed and even used the memory card reader . All of this without the documentation . I guess there is one other minor complaint about the unit which is that you have to attach the ethernet cable inside the unit . Not difficult at all , just not logical . I have the printer sitting on my wireless network ( easy to do ! ) and all of my machines can print from it . If you are looking for an affordable multi-function unit , this is the guy for you !  
2	  I finally got my IBM Microdrive , in the CompactFlash slot of this SIIG 8-in-1 card reader , to mount on my Mac G4 Laptop , for the first time after 3 months of failure , and fairly brisk but non-curative e-mail responses from SIIG tech help . First hint of a turnaround came when I tried it yesterday on my wife 's 2 Mac laptops and it promptly mounted and opened on both , one running Mac OS 9.2 , the other running OS 10.4.2 ( Tiger ) . But it still would not mount on my Mac Model A1046 15 " laptop , purchased Sept 2003 . On Googling the " SIIG 8-ib-1 reader does not mount " problem , I found suggestions that the Microdrive might need more power than the USB 2.0 bus could supply . Then I tried a 32 MB CompactFlash card that came new with my Canon Camera , and it mounted at once . So I removed that from the card reader and once more inserted the Microdrive-and NOW it has mounted and dismounted and remounted again through 3 cycles - no more problems . I give 4 stars to SIIG and Amazon for the product , and save one for me for the hope and bungling perseverance that finally got it to work .  
2	  I know I am the current seller of these business card cd-r pack . I have never had a problem with these cds . They are great for job interviews , product catologues , ect . I have been able to burn right from my laptop . They look great and each has a plastic protective sleave . They fit perfect into wallets and are the size of a credit card .  
1	  For some reason , my idiot boyfriend bought these for 228 , which is way too much . The instructions say the speakers need to be 35 feet from the router . So , unless you are using them in a business location , they echo . No , I don't mean they give you a clear surround sound effect , I mean they have about a full second delay from the TV to the speakers . They are not completely " wireless " either . The speakers are wired to each other , so you still have an awkward wire across the room .. plus the obvious cord to the outlet .  
1	  I went out to radio shack today to purchase catch-a-call , all I can say is save your money and don't trust any products that display the logo , " AS SEEN ON TV " I followed the instruction and took my time and double checked my connection , and all I got when the unit rang and answer the phone was the sound that a fax machine makes . To me it just was not worth the forty buck 's !  
2	  This is my second one of this model router ( first one died from lightning spike ) . I love how well this handles everything thrown at it - i don't use the software that came with it , but installed DD-WRT , which really allows the router to use it 's fullest capabilities . A solid router for tweaking , hardware is up for the task if you use other software than what comes with it - as long as your okay with the risk involved with potentially bricking it if your install goes wrong .  
1	  the case is beautiful yes , but its horrible to arrange wires in ! i had a modular PS and still have cables everywhere ! and you can't really stash them anywhere so they are all over the place . Also i had to remove one of the fan mounts on the back of one of the places that holds drives in order to get my video card to fit inside . def wouldn't get this thing again if i would of known how bad it was with room on the inside . Also had a hard time getting my MB inside it correctlypretty much its a nightmare . don't expect to have it standing on display unless you plan on drilling holes for cables  
1	  I 'm normally a big fan of microsoft ergo keyboards , and have always prefered ergo over a standard keyboard . However , after a few days of using this newly redesigned keyboard , I was extremely disappointed and had to exchange it for a standard logitech keyboard . First , this keyboard is very large . This really isn't a problem . However , the tiny plastic feet that support the back of the keyboard can barely support it 's weight . Any pressure on these feet will cause them to bend or break . Once looking at them , you 'll easily see why . Second , it looks like Microsoft decided that since the keyboard was split and that they had extra room , they would change the size of a few lettered keys towards the middle so they are twice the size of a normal key ! Add this to the fact that the keys feel " squishy " and you 've got one crazy typing experience . It certainly does not feel natural at all . I really did try to get use to this , but I kept finding myself pressing incorrect keys , or having to look at the keyboard to make sure I hit the right key . The large hot keys at the top of the keyboard are a nice touch . But for media playback , it has a Play / Pause button , and that 's it . No next , forward , back , or even a stop button . For no apparent reason , they are simply nowhere to be found . Now , it does feel comfortable ( even though you can barely type at half your normal typing speed ) , and it looks great . And that 's where the compliments end . I even had 2 other friends try out the keyboard , and they agreed .. it 's just not natural . Pros : - It looks great in black / silver - Comfortable to rest your hands on the keyboard - Keyboard has a good solid feel ( excluding feet ) . Cons : - The tiny plastic feet are useless - Some letters on keyboard are larger than others ( annoying ) - Keys feel way too soft and offer no feedback - Missing extra media controlsWhile this keyboard may be " comfortable " and looks nice , it 's just not practical for daily use if the feet break , the keys feel strange , and it slows down your typing experience . I 'd suggest going with an older microsoft ergo keyboard or sticking with a standard keyboard .  
1	  this product is a waste of time .. Just get the phone company out and do a better job .. I made the mistake of this purchase .. Dont you .  
1	  I had been a fan of these Logitech Harmony Universal remotes for the past couple years now , but I hate to say that I 'm finished with them . I 've been through three in that time , for a total of $ 370 , this model 676 being the last . When they work , they are wonderful . But each of mine only worked for a few months , then , I guess the buttons wear out . I am the only one who uses it so it 's not as if it 's gotten extraordinary use . Logitech 's tech support is very poor , even though I made it to " Level 2 " , they still put me through the same troubleshooting paces I had done myself , over and over again without success , and even though it 's still under warranty , they refuse to replace it ! So I 'm sitting here with 3 very expensive paperweights . I 'm surely not going to try for the more expensive ones ! If the $ 150 ones can't cut it , I 'm done . As a result of my experience , I can't recommend them . So I 'm back to juggling 5 remotes . :(  
2	  I have had the Nuvi for a few days now and from my experience so far , the unit does a great job for point to point Navigation . Although , it would have been nice if more manipulation were possible , there are certain options offered that could help to make the unit present a route which is acceptable . One of the primary reasons i bought this product was because of its compact size . Almost nothing else i have seen so far beats the Nuvi in terms of convenience when you are a travelling person . Which is where i have my big complaint , the unit i bought from Amazon had to be returned to them because the car charger ( DC convertor ) got stuck in the side of the Nuvi and refused to come off . This means every time i wanted to carry the nuvi with me , the car charger would accompany us . When i called Garmin i was told after a 50 minute wait that you are not supposed to connect the car charger to the side of the Nuvi , but instead it needs to be connected to the behind through the car mount . Although i found this hard to beleive , Garmin offered to help to free the charger from the USB Mini port . To avoid any complications i thought it best to return to Amazon and seek a replacement which they very promptly despatched to me . After receiving the unit i decided not to be too adventurous so i plugged in the DC car charger to the back of the car mount - and guess what ? Its stuck there permanently ! I yanked and tugged but to no avail ! The only good thing this time is that i can now take the Nuvi off the mount without the charger having to be lugged around . But if i do want the Car charger to be taken with me , then the cradle of the mount joins the merry family . How come no one else has had this problem ? I am surprised that there seems to be a defect with the Car charger plug-something that most certainly is a critical aspect-if you do have the charger stuck in the side of the nuvi , you cannot use the USB port for down loads etc and neither can use the AC wall charger to charge the unit as it plugs into the mini usb port as well ! Having said this , i need to point out that there is no problem with the Wall charger it slides in and out smoothly from the USB Mini port on the side of the Nuvi - wonder what Garmin will have to say about this ? Cannot afford another 50 minute wait to be told some other story !  
1	  While this laptop is attractive , and the screen looks great , almost everything else about it is terrible . Opening up a simple program like Internet Explorer took as much as 30 seconds ( when nothing else was running and the computer was clean and free from any viruses ) . When I right clicked on the desktop , it took as much as 30 seconds for the menu to pop up . My laptop recently broke for the 2nd time . If you want an easy-to-use , quick computer , then do not buy this .  
2	  This drive is wonderful and meets all my expectations . It is sturdy , compact , well built and looks good on my work station . It arrived here in Alaska in record time with no problems . Thank you .  
1	  I 've gone through 3 WRE54G range expanders and they have all died . The last 2 died in less than 3 months ! I 'll never purchase another Linksys product .  
1	  Mistake # 1 I originally bought the combo so I could sync my pda since it 's a bluetooth device , but MS doesn't include the required bluetooth profiles . Mistake # 2 Even though the keyboard and mouse have great designs , the MS Bluetooth transceiver can not function properly with any other Bluetooth transceiver on the computer system . So buying a Bluetooth USB adapter from another company and installing it will not work ( its either the Microsoft transceiver or a competing company or neither - However , bluetooth profiles for the keyboard / mouse combo are not included with competing companies bluetooth usb adapters ) . Too make a long story short , at this time , a decision to have a bluetooth wireless keyboard / mouse combo or a different bluetooth usb adapter to allow syncing of pdas and other devices must be made . YOU CAN NOT HAVE BOTH . While installing both devices will work initially , eventually the wireless connection will be lost and more time will be spent unstalling and reinstalling the combo than actually using it .

2	  I bought this card as a replacement for a friend and couldn't believe the cost ! Great bargain for a full gigabyte .  
2	  Perfect .. love the hard case cover . The size and product is perfect for travelling too . This the 4th one I have bought .  
1	  Though the product does what it is supposed to , there are just too many FM channels wherever I travel and the quality is not good . It is now my expensive ipod charger in my car .  
2	  I purchased this Analog Standard Cassette Transcriber with attachments in Sept . through Amazon and company that was selling the product . Started using it and it worked great . Next time I used it I could not get the foot pedal to work . Called the company that I bought it from through Amazon and they were absolutely wonderful . Fred helped me to discover what the problem was , I returned it , they fixed it , and sent back to me within 7 days along with a check to cover my postage for return . Fred , I could not have asked for better customer service ! Thank you ! And I would recommend to anyone to purchase this kind of product through Amazon . GREAT customer service !  
2	  I have never been a person who can wear standard earbuds , like for the iPod . I 've tried the kind that are supposed to hook around your ears as well , but no luck there either . I purchased these two years ago and have found them very comfortable , and they sound fantastic , especially for working out . They are starting to lose their sound quality now , but I 've beaten these things to death , and would absolutely buy them again . Don't hesitate !  
2	  Could not find this camera any where except for here . I am so happy that I did . My daughter loves it . Very easy to use and it produces nice pictures . I very please with it and also thank you on how fast the service was on buying it . I received it very quickly in the mail . Thanks again , Norma  
2	  Great product as stated the pliers paired with this item is not the best , the main image needs to be removed . It 's not of the product and misleading for sales . The second image is what you get with this ( thus the title ) . But well worth it for these items as they have helped well where other connectors did not .  
2	  I 've had these for a couple of years now and use them regularly when I go jogging ( I wear a headband over them to keep them on ) . They have held up well and the in-line volume control is a handy feature to have . They are comfortable to wear and produce good sound , plus they are light and airy over the ears , which is why I like to use them when I exercise . I really don't think you can beat them for the price . Keep in mind that they are NOT noise cancellng , which are going to be more expensive and are really best for air travel anyway .  
1	  The manual says that this can remember the last 5 disks played and the last viewed scenes . This is not true . If you rotate between three disks it will forget where in each you last viewed and start you off at a random location . If you rotate between four it will forget that you even watched them and start you off as if they were new disks at the beginning . There is no slow forward or reverse . You have to pause and single step . On some commercially recorded DVDs the image will vibrate vertically when there is sharp brightness changes . On some there will be horizontal lines ( like the IBM trademark ) on text . The 504 model that came out later does not have these problems .  
2	  I performed an exhaustive search for the right mono laser printer . I landed the Brother HL-5250DNT , and I couldn't be happier . Here 's what I was looking for during my search . 1 ) Speed ( first page and pages per minute ) 2 ) Image quality3 ) Economic consumables4 ) Connectivity ( USB and parallel minimum , networkable a plus ) 5 ) Expandability6 ) Duplex printing a big plus7 ) Size - nothing too huge8 ) QuietHere 's what I got . 1 ) I am amazed at how fast this printer is . It prints the first page almost immediately . Wakes up from sleep mode instantly and prints quickly . Great PPM speed . 2 ) Excellent quality text and graphics . Photos print out very well with no banding . 3 ) Toner cartridge has good page rating ( 3,500 @ 5 %) and replacements are relatively inexpensive . High yield cart is about $ 50 for 7,000 pages @ 5 % . 4 ) Comes with USB , parallel , and Ethernet - the triple play5 ) Expandability - it already comes with a second paper tray ( about $ 50 more than the model without the tray . Separately , the tray is about $ 120 ) Holds an amazing 550 pages . Also accepts up to 512MB additional memory in easy access slot . 6 ) I fell in love with duplex printing . I keep duplex on all the time . Cuts paper use almost in half ( some printouts have odd number of pages to print ) . 7 ) Nice footprint . Fits nicely on desktop . Solid , but not very heavy . 8) Zero noise in sleep mode . Much quieter than my Minolta when printing . Love it . I was impressed at how easy it was to set up . Load the Vista drivers ( yes , a Vista CD is included ) , plug in the printer , and you 're golden . Printed flawlessly the first time . Setup program let me designate the second paper tray . Just make sure you load the CD before you hook up the printer . Lots of flexibility with setup options . Driver / utilities do not take up a large amount of disk space . Much better than HP software clogging up the system . Regarding page curl , I am using a basic 20lb paper ( Boise ) and the page curl is marginal . Definitely not annoying . In fact , lie the paper flat after printing , and it flattens out quickly . Very slight curl on premium 24lb paper ( Hammermill ) . If you need to print large docs , this printer is definitely a workhorse . Over several years , the price difference between this and a " personal " laser printer will be insignificant . Go with the solid workhorse and don't look back .  
1	  Does anyone see anywhere here or on Linksys ' site where they tell you that this does not work with Windows 7 ? No , you don't Linksys will sell you the unit , and then do nothing about supporting it . You will be out the money . I 've seen a few posts on some of the forums where very technical people came up with work arounds but they are not easy , I ended up returning over 200 dollars worth of Linksys equipment I had bought because this unit will not work . Had they been upfront on their site I would not have ordered the item . As it was I felt very cheated , as do many other people . Amazon needs to give this product the boot ASAP .  
2	  I bought these stands for my Bose Speaker System and Surround sound Receiver I bought from Costco . They are perfect for my setup . They were easy to assemble and they help to hide the wires . Delivery was very prompt .  
2	  I bought this card for my new Pentax K100D Super D-SLR . It works great , fast and reliable . No problems whatsoever .  
1	  Ordered it , took about 5 days to get to me , and it 's corrupted and cannot format itself and cannot put files on it .  
1	  1 1/2 - 2 weeks after receiving the intellicord unit it failed . The unit 's indicators lights were functioning but it did not power-up my whistler xtr 695se radar . Luckly , I was able to fall back on the original power cord for the radar to function properly . I am really surprised the failed unit didn't even make it passed the 30 day mark . I am in the process of returning the intellicord back to the seller ( antonline_com ) . So far no issues from them at this point .  
2	  Polk audio is excellent sound for price . I have smaller Klipsch speakers that produce better sound , in my opinion . They are too expensive to justify for all of the speakers in my house , though :) Can't speak much to the highs and lows . My center channel 's got amazing highs , and my sub takes care of the lows . These complete the surround , and I have no issues with what they produce .  
2	  I bought the 8GB card and i use it on my 10mp digital camera and WOW it holds a little over 4000 pictures ! it was a great buy for a low price  
1	  It simply does not work . I tried everything . Thought it was formatting or something else . Made sure the lock was off . But it still did not work . Seeing how many others had the same experience I 'm sending it back . You would think Amazon would get the message .  
2	  You 'll pay $ 20 here or over at Microsoft 's web site . Note that you 'll have to type in 10 codes . That took me a whopping 3 minutes to save $ 5 . So if you 're willing to pay yourself $ 100 an hour , post-tax , this is for you .  
1	  windows 7 , apple , and windows phone 7 are not compatible . visit their official site for older compatible phones . This is really old .  
1	  I guess you get what you pay for rings true here . I bought this to hold up a small camera . Well , that plan didn't work out too well . I couldn't get it to stand up without falling over . Total waste of money . I ended up going to best buy to their camera department and bought a more solid mini tripod that worked perfectly . Buyer beware . Make sure your camera is really really light or it will fall over .  
2	  The reason for buying this is to replace the exact same one the was stolen from our car . We have had other ones .. itrip , etc .. but they have problems getting washed out by local stations . This one can automatically screen for the best chanels making the job easier , and it can also go into the 87 's , below most transmitters making it great for long drives . My son loves the replacement so I actually bought an additional one for my other son with the same degree of success . If you can keep your kids from complaining about a product , that is a degree of product success . It also has more broadcast power than other units so that helps it maintain a good signal . Label this review as buying what works !  
2	  I bought these speakers so I could listen to my XM radio in my garage . They plugged right in and work very well for me . Although they are low cost , they have very good sound . Excellent buy !  
2	  This a great product that lives up to the claims . I love this product because it works . Thanks  
1	  I 'd read a number of reviews before choosing the ER6i and so was prepared for some amount of one-time work to get it all right-particularly in terms of fit and learning how to install-but in the end could not get it to produce $ 85 in improvement over stock iPod phones . Most frustrating was that , in changing over to the foam buds , one of the filters-which the instructions clearly state cannot be reused after removal-simply fell out . Of course I reused it because I wasn't prepared to buy a new filter while I was still trialing the thing , which for the benefit of you strong ER6i advocates I 'll admit may have had some impact on my view on performance-although I strongly suspect it was fine to replace the filter and its more true that Etymotic gives that warning because they don't want people to run them thru the diswasher rather than replace them when needed ;-) Bottom line is that my experience-poor fit and inadequate performance-is similar enough to a number of users that regardless of advocates ' reviews it 's clear the product needs some work before it can extend its market appeal . ( Finally , I actually found a noticeable improvement in stock iPod phones when I bought new thicker foam covers ; they stay put in the ear better and am convinced the compression of the thicker foam goes a long way to keep out more external sound . )  
2	  First off , I want to sing the praises of Amazon for the way they responded to the problems that I had with the first unit I received . The return / exchange was so fast , it was unbelieveable ! The unit itself is a great piece . Sound Quality is excellent for its size and price . Simple to use , and the perfect size to take along wherever you are going . This is an excellent accessory to any portable music player .  
1	  I bought this quite a while back as a cheap way to read my Sandisk Pro Duo cards .. glitchy , unreliable . Half the time i 'll have a card mounted on my Mac or PS3 and it will unmount and completely corrupt the data or just not read the card , totally useless most of the time . The cover never snaps all the way shut , it 's junk . I wind up using my PSPGO to read and copy files over this trash .  
1	  Wow . What can I say other than this has got to be one of the worst electronic purchases that I 've ever made . The DWL-G650 is a pretty good PCCard , however the DI-624 router is absolutely horrid ! From the moment I plugged it in it wouldn't quit rebooting itself every 1-2 minutes kicking me off the network . Firmware flashes didn't solve the problem at all nor did a replacement product . ( Incidentally , Amazon . com was WONDERFUL about sending a replacement product ) . How D-Link gets away with selling this product is beyond me . I 'd read similar reviews on the product with it constantly rebooting however I must admit that I 'd written those off as the typical " home user " that really didn't know what they were doing . Well , as a network engineer and systems administrator at one of the world 's largest computer companies , I have to throw my towel in to the absolutely worst network product I 've ever worked with here in the DI-624 . Please .. avoid this router at ALL costs .  
2	  The cable was useful for my math courses and now my calculator is able to match up to a Ti-84  
1	  My husband and I bought two of these and after using them for a little over a year ( i.e. when they were no longer under warranty ) they both developed the same problem of shutting off unexpectedly . Once they had shut off like this , we would have to let them " rest " for a few hours before they would turn on again . Eventually mine never turned on again . Viewsonic did nothing for us and we are stuck with 2 broken monitors . If you do a little research online , you will see otheres with similar complaints . Buyer beware ..  
2	  I detect a disturbance in The Force , to wit : I think this is a new meme , a paradigm shift . I predict that Amazon reviews are going to .. change . To quote Herbert Bitman in " The boy who predicted earthquakes , " a 1971 episode of Night Gallery , " Tomorrow 's going to be different from anything in the past .. " I think this will happen at about the same time that observations of the Higgs Boson are confirmed at CERN . Oh , wait .. That happened this week .. DUCK !  
2	  Got it for my wife . She loves it . Gets extreme use and has held up great  
2	  Wow , the pictures that this camera takes are fantastic ! I 've had it for 8 months and the pictures that it takes are absolutely incredible . Our old digital 's battery would hardly last two pictures , this battery lasts for days with frequent use . You first look at it and you think it 's small , but it zooms in perfectly . It has tons of settings for taking pictures , my personal favorite is the " Sports " setting so that your pictures with proper focusing will never be blurry . Highly reccomended camera !  
1	  I purchased a RipFlash Plus 256 MP3 player / recorder in June 2004 to record voice interviews . Major flaws in its construction and in its download software mean you are very likely to lose your recordings . To make matters worse , customer support is very resistant to issuing refunds for faulty equipment . - It produces decent sound quality , though the recordings have a constant low-level hum in the background . Two main problems with the unit make it very problematic for capturing recordings : 1 ) The software provided ( and required ) to download the sound files to computer over USB is very flakey - sometimes it works , sometimes does not connect , sometimes downloads only part of the sound file but indicates it is " done . " This happens on both of the newer Dell computers that I 've tried it on . By contrast , all other devices I attach to the USB ports on these same computers exchange files flawlessly . 2 ) The RipFlash Plus is able to hold a SmartMedia card and record to it . This would seem to be an alternative to downloading through the USB connection - just remove the SmartMedia card , insert it into your computers card reader , and copy off the files . BUT . . . the ejector button on the RipFlash broke the second time I ejected a card , and appears likely to break on any unit . The ejector button pushes the card out with two very tiny brittle plastic tabs . It takes almost nothing to break one ( in my case , just ejecting the card did it . ) Then , you can't get the card out , or if you do fish it out , you can no longer position it in correctly without the button in place . Regarding customer support . . . when the unit arrived in the mail , I discovered that they had thrown in a " voice activated TV remote " - at no charge , and without any advance notice - a device they don't sell on their site . I can't imagine anything more useless than that so I tossed it immediately . After obtaining an RMA from them and returning the broken RipFlash , they at first tried to charge me a " restocking " fee for the useless recorder . After I put my credit card company on their case , they finally refunded the full amount . Then , they decided they needed to charge me $ 40 for the throw-away remote that they had sent unsolicited , so they made a new charge on my card for it . You might want to consider the options before you decide to try the RipFlash Plus . Rob  
2	  IMO , U2 is the best Flash players around . What I like the most in my player ? -> Excellent sound quality ( default earbuds that come with the players don't match well with the player though - replace ' em with iPod 's and you will love it ! ) > Compact size > Line-in and Voice recording > FM Radio + recordingThe only thing I miss in the player is AM radio as I listen to Bloomberg radio every morning .  
2	  I bought these for outdoor use and paired them with the lepai 2020 amp . I was expecting just to get " sound " out of these and nothing special . I am amazed at how full the sound is that these produce . The only downfall is the tweeter material and terminals are a little cheap looking . but you had to cut cost somewhere . I would expect the tweeter to be the first thing to go on these . But if they last me a few years outdoors for the price I have no complaints . If your looking for inexpensive outdoor speakers these are the way to go .  
2	  I installed a new stereo in my 2000 Honda Accord with this harness and it was a breeze . The wires were a little long for my liking so I cut them shorter and soldered them to the stereo harness . From there the install was as simple as unbolting the dash , pulling out the old head unit , plugging this one in , and putting the dash back together .. maybe 10 minutes at the most . At this price I 'd feel dumb for not getting it . If the stereo ever breaks or gets stolen at least I can go back to the stock unit . Keep the factory connections , buy a wiring harness - they 're worth it !  
2	  I have a similar version its t-23 2647-EU9 its generall the same maching . I got mine of ebay for 400 and its great . Not really any heating problems . Dont be scared of the track point its alot easier than touch pads once u spend about thirty minutes with it . It doesnt inhibit typing at all . I had problems on other laptops b / c when i would set my wrist down on the palm rest i would touch the touch pad and it would click somewhere in my text and i wouldn't notice it and that was very annoying . Great battery life even with the LCD turned onto bright . If you get it without drivers ibm has an updater you can download . i like the wireless internet , had a few problems saying it " couldn't start " but i just disabled it and shut down the computer and let it sit awhile then turn it on and enable it and it would work great . It has good connectivity . The must is to use the windows wireless program it beats out ibm 's program . has infrered for people with media cellphones . speakers point down from front of laptop , which projects into my lap and then into the computer where it makes it sound like music is comming out of the keyboard . But overall this is an awesome computer with an awesome keayboard ! i love it !  
1	  One week after I bought it , the 30Gb zune won't turn on . I tried every mothod , it just doesnt response any thing . I found that many users have the same problem . It 's really not a good choice .  
1	  Don't waste your money and time on this junk . I bought 2 100 spindles , I got 15 consecutive coasters from my first spindles . I thought it was just my luck with the first spindle , then I got another 10 coasters from the second spindle . 100 % failure rate , incredible ! DON'T buy ! LANDFILLED MATERIAL ! JUNK ! TRASH !  
1	  We bought this computer in 2004 and had it repaired for a loose power jack in 2006 ( symptoms : loses power either sporadically or completely ; eventually destroys the motherboard due to arcing at the power source and simply won't start ) . It took months to repair because it came back with a faulty keyboard and had to be sent back . Now , again , the power jack is loose . Looking online , I see this is fairly common for HP notebooks ( as well as for several other brands ) . But HP doesn't " recognize " this problem and therefore won't recall it or offer free repair or a work-around solution . It 's common for manufacturers to attempt to blame the consumer for moving the notebook around too much or for pulling out the adapter at an angle , or whatever . But we didn't even move this HP zv5120us notebook / laptop since it was last repaired , except for maybe once . Hey , you should be able to move the darn thing ; it 's a LAPTOP ! If people want something to be done about this , they need to contact HP and complain . I did ; unfortunately , they are just parrots that can only repeat that the problem is not recognized as an issue and that I can pay for a repair ( hundreds of dollars and weeks of time lost . ) The one work-around that I saw people talking about online , an all-in-one media entertainment cable , is said by HP technicians not to be a real solution , as the power supply still arcs inside and will eventually cause damage / failure . Even if you want to try it , this cable is currently not to be found , at least not at the retail price of $ 40 . You might find it on Ebay for many times that - probably because of all the HP owners trying to get around the loose jack problem , not realizing or caring that it 's a temporary fix at best . Thanks for letting me express my frustration . Maybe it will help to caution potential buyers , and maybe some people who are experiencing the same issue will contact HP to let them know it IS a " recognized " problem , at least among many of their customers . I 'm big on consumer rights , and I feel it 's just not right for HP to be in denial at the consumer 's expense ! ( Other weaknesses that we have noticed : The paint finish wears off very quickly ; the dvd player stops sometimes while watching . )  
1	  This TV has been a disappointment . You 're supposed to be able to view in 720p , and I haven't been able to since I had DirecTV HD setup . It flickers every 3 seconds and makes a horrible screeching sound . 480p works just ok . You can't watch one channel however for more than 10 minutes without the picture flickering , going black or getting a " searching for signal " message . I 've had this tv for three weeks now and haven't been able to talk to a samsung technician because they 're only available from 6-7 EST , M-F , which sucks for any West Coast person with a job . I 've tried troubleshooting the thing myself , resetting the HD box , switching out HDMI cables , unplugging and replugging in the tv . Nothing seems to work . Scarily , the DirecTV guy , who I had come out a second time just to make sure it wasn't a bad connection , said he just installed the hd box for another customer with a different samsung dlp , who had the same problems not being able to watch on 720p . Seriously , what 's the point of having an HDTV if you can't watch in HD ? 480 isn't considered HD !  
2	  I only gave it 4 based on the brightness . However , you would have to pay $ 6000.00 + to get one any brighter with the resolution this projector has . I purchased and compared this unit with a BenQ PB6200 . The Benq PB6200 has 1700 lumens , is XGA resolution , has a 2x color wheel and is listed at 2000:1 contrast ratio . The SP4805 of course is 750 Lumens , SVGA , 4x color wheel , and 2200:1 contrast . Here are my observations : Using Conventional Cable TV feed . ( To a VCR then Svideo to teh projector ) . The BenQ is brighter . I would hope so , with supposedly twice the lumens . However you don't really get twice the brightness in reality . It is brighter , but not twice as bright . At the same distance from the screen , the BENQ gives you a bigger screen . I had it in 4:3 mode , which is the only acceptable picture for either of them for watching TV . The Screenplay 4805 picture had better detail . I actually liked watching it a little better because the detail was crisper . My wife and kids however liked the BENQ because of the brightness , and larger output . Now the DVD Test : Using Lord of the rings , the results were about the same as the TV test . The BEnQ was brighter , but the Screenplay was crisper , so it comes down to personal choice I suppose . The Screenplay does have 4:3 , 16:9 , and Letterbox . So if you put your DVD player in 16:9 mode , and the 4805 in Letterbox , it makes for a large fully filled screen . The Benq only has 4:3 , and 16:9 , so the same movie in 16:9 , still has the black areas top and bottom . However with the Benq 's zoom you can make it just about as large as the screenplay 's output . Bottom Line : The Screenplay sp4805 is made for a really dark room . In that dark room you will get great video / DVD output . Like a movie theater . The BENQ is brighter , and probably better if you want to watch more TV , or sports , and don't want to sit in total darkness . So it is a trade off . If you just intend to use your projector for movie night , then go with the Screenplay . However if you want to watch TV in a slightly brighter room , you will probably like the BENQ PB6200 better . In this price range it is a trade off . To get brightness and great resolution , you have to be ready to put out $ 7,000.00 to $ 10,000.00 or more , and I just can't justify that yet , unless I get a really big raise in the near future . Not likely . Now I plan on testing each of them with HDTV . I am thinking that with the BENQ 's XGA output , that it will match the Screenplay in HDTV . I will let you know later .  
2	  This device does exactly what I wanted it to do , which is record interviews and make them easy to transcribe . I 'm a financial reporter in New York , and really noticed the DM-10 when I went to a press conference and four out of five reporters whipped them out . Now I know why : Back at the office , I can download a 45-minute recording to the computer in a minute , and review it at digital high speed or digital low speed as I choose . Indexing is easy . I can also convert to a . wav file so colleagues can review it . The software is the charm . Hardware 's not bad either : it slips easily in the pocket . Anyone who 's used an iPod will grok the " hold " switch , which is the " off " button if you 're not recording or playing . This would not be a very useful device for my purposes if absent a computer . I 've not tried to use it as an mp3 player . It uses regular AA batteries , a more robust power solution than rechargables . Power consumption seems low .  
2	  This ink , Epson 78 Black Ink Cartridge ( T078120 ) , goes with our Epson printer , Photo Stylus # RX595 , which takes SIX ink cartridges that all run out at different times . The product quality is great-prints clear copies and photos consistently . Although there are six colors and cartridges to replace , the black runs out the most often , so if you buy it here , especially with Amazon Prime and a subscription to have it delivered regularly you save at LEAST $ 5 or more on gas , the cartridge , tax , and shipping ( or any combination of those ) . I have bought these at a number of places and this is the cheapest anywhere . Five bucks per cartridge adds up-put it in your vacation account ! These are the easiest cartridges I 've ever replaced . They are small and when indicator light pops up on your monitor , you just quickly slide out the old cartridge and pop in the new one . No ink on hands , no bulky cartridges to recycle . Two clean thumbs up in my book ! Buy them today and get your flying fingers ready for typing those finals , resumes , novels , and more !  
2	  This item is pricey , but I am extremely happy with it ! It is very easy to use . Just get the picture to appear on the television screen-toggle the channel buttons up and down until it appears-and press " record . " When the record session is over , press " stop , " and the unit automatically archives the session , setting up an index on the disc as it goes . When you play back the disc , the index appears , showing you the lead frame of each recording session . Picture quality is fabulous , particularly where the " HQ " setting is used . The recorder handles all sorts of connection arrangements . There is even a direct camcorder hookup in a port on the front of the machine-this is behind a pop-out panel and so is not visible in the Amazon . com picture . Just remember , this is DVD + R , DVD + RW technology . So don't buy the wrong discs .  
2	  This is really a nice family camera - and for people that can not afford the most expensive this is the best buy in terms of quality and performance . Pictures are clear . Zoom works well and takes good action pictures . Video recording is excellent . If you have big memory card you can take as long video clip has you got memory . Good buy !  
2	  again and again i find stuff on amazon for far cheaper then in store . We have best buy where i live and have to go there for parts . They are so overpriced that i have stopped going there and am more then happy to wait for belivery . I am a pc gamer and play on a 55 " in my living room . I had been using wireless keyboards but they always were haveing range or interference problems so i bought this cord . More then enuff length for me to use my keyboard anywhere in my living room .  
1	  The router wireless connection got disconnected every few hours . After Netgear techicain send me a software update the router just stopped work completely .  
1	  The reception is poor , the number of stations is small , and the ear-pieces aren't that comfortable . Might as well pay twice as much for a [ money ] no-skip CD-player , or [ money ] for a radio reciever that actually transmits .  
2	  This was a very good purchasing experience . The item was just as described and was shipped immediately . I really liked it .  
2	  Correct rating on these I received via Amazon from Parts Express ( printed right on the product ) : 150Hz @ 8ohms300Hz @ 4ohmsSo these are useless to me personally . I contacted Parts Express via email , and they quickly and professionally handled my issue . Very very happy with the seller Parts Express !  
2	  # - # - # - [ Why this rating ? ] - # - # - # Some 2 years ago , when I bought my HV20 , I did a lot of research on tapes , and the consensus overwhelmingly pointed to the Panasonic AMQ family . So far , with over 50 tapes used , I am a happy camper indeed - no dropouts , and great quality . I am a true believer now , and hence the 5-star " I Love It ! " rating . # - # - # - [ Tape Types ] - # - # - # Irrespective of the tape you decide to use , I learned that it was more important to be loyal to the type of lubricant used - referred to by my friends as wet or dry tapes . The Panasonic belongs to the dry type family , whereas Sony tapes use a wet lubricant . For instance , Panasonic claims that this tape uses a " .. dry type lubricant [ that ] causes less video head wear ( - 4m after 500H ) . It also prevents head clogs and extends head life . " While some on the ' net argue that this distinction is an urban myth - I decided to trust my professional friends on this issue . This difference is not material until you switch between the two types - which can lead to clogged video heads . # - # - # - [ Archival ] - # - # - # I rely very heavily on tape as an archival mechanism for all my HD masters . Hence my decision to go with the AMQ series over the PQ series ( which are a bit cheaper ) . Happy Recording ! - Damodar  
1	  " I have had this since 2/06 , after approximately 4 months the tv stopped working . Service was called and it took 1 month to order the part . Three weeks later the same part failed and service was called again . They were told this part was on back order with no estimated time for it to come in . I contacted Philips and was told they can do nothing for me . I then asked for a phone number for customer service and the lady REFUSED to provide me with it . One would have to ask themselves why they would purchase a product from a company like this ! "  
2	  Large wheels make it easy to push even on carpet . It is easy to see around . Mounting hardware makes it easy to mount any large screen . I now have ordered three . Very stable and strong .  
1	  More memory is not better . This card does not work in most of our computers . It 's too big ! Didn't work in some Celeron and Athlon computers . Try the 256K instead .  
1	  Found this case to be poorly constructed - I travel w / laptops / training materials frequently and have owned / used several cases over the years ; liked idea of side access ( so one can pull laptop from overhead storage bin with minimal difficulty ) - however , telescoping handle detent pin ( s ) broke on 2nd trip ; causing handle to be stuck in extended position ; had to literally rip bag / handle apart in airport in order to get it collapsed so I could get it back on board . Previous ( several years ago ) versions of this bag are well rated ; but recent reviews would seem to indicate a deterioration in quality . Can't recommend and will not purchase a SOLO product again .  
1	  I read the reviews before I bought this . Numerous people complained about a hissing noise that you hear all the time . So why did I go ahead with buying it ? Because I am _ NOT _ an audiophile ! I know people who will only listen to 256 kbps MP3s because they can " totally hear the difference between 192 and 256 . " Well , I can't ! So when I read those reviews I thought that maybe the reviewers were just overly picky . Let me tell you - they are NOT . The humming hissing noise is really loud . It sounds like those old clock radios " wake to buzz " - if those alarm clocks have a volume of 10 , this is certainly a 1 . I really really thought that I could deal with it . I said , " Well , most of the time I will listen to it fairly loud . " But then a song came on that had a lot of quiet parts , and you could hear that horrible hiss ! I 'm going to have to send it back - it 's that bad .  
2	  This our third digital camera . Our other cameras are from Canon and Nikon . I was leaning toward the new Canon S60 because we love our other Canon and they both would take the same CompactFlash memory cards . This camera was going to be mine and I wanted 5MP so I could do some cropping of pictures and still keep up the quality when printing in 8 X 10 format . The Canon S60 kept being delayed , so I started looking at alternatives . The DSCW1 seems designed to compete with the Canon S60 . Both are 5 MP , both are compact , both have manual modes which allow you to be creative with your pictures . The Sony pulled ahead with its larger LCD display and its ability to use standard AA batteries . The Canon relies on a propriatory lithium-ion rechargable battery . The Sony comes with AA rechargables , but should they go dead at an inopportune moment , you can pop in any AA batteries to keep you going . I bought the Sony and have had it for almost a month . The batteries don't seem to last quite as long as our Canon , but I picked up a couple of spare rechargables for less than $ 10 and just alternate them in the charger . The DSCW1 downloads using USB2 so even though each picture is larger than 2MB each , they download FAST . The picture quality has been great . Indoor low light shots have a bit more blur than I would like , but they didn't come out at all with either of our other cameras . Colors are crisp and true and prints from the pictures ( on a Canon i470 printer ) are excellent . One word about the included software . Yuck . It is useful for downloading and for doing a quick view of what you took , but beyond that it is very limited . Overall , I am very happy with my Sony DSCW1 .  
2	  Easy to manage , great size . You need to buy the case though .. Charger makes it so easy .. no cables . Highly recommended .  
2	  This trackball was a gift and I enjoyed it very much , exept that you have to clean it often and the ( rollers ? ) don't last very long . Within a year I had to replace the mouse .  
1	  This mounting kit will be perfect for you .. as long as you have a stud exactly in the right place . Unlike most kits that include a cross bar to affix to studs on either side of the desired mount location , this kit has two holes in the plate . You can thus mount it directly to a stud , and nowhere else . So if you 're trying to center it in a precise spot , you better get lucky with the stud finder . ( Or have a masonry wall )  
1	  Sent item back to the company and got a rejected mail saying , " COMPANY OUT OF BUSINESS , RETURN TO SENDER " . The company address on the label is : Recoton Accessories , Inc . 2950 Lake Emma RoadLake Mary , FL 32746 . Made in China  
2	  Does exactly what a person would basically need it to do - route DVI to video , probably the only item like itself in existence  
1	  After two weeks of working , it just broke down . 4 weeks after reporting it to Kensington , I am still waiting for a replacement but they do not have in stock so I had to go for another item and that one does not arrive .  
2	  I used this card for photos and video in my Kodak z1285 , and it worked without any problems .  
2	  This mount was very easy to install on my wall . It is very easy to attach a mid sized or larger plasma screen .  
2	  I noticed all the negative feedback after purchasing this remote . I picked it up about a month ago , and have really enjoyed it . Took me all of 10 minutes to figure out how the various setup options worked , had it completely configured in about an hour . Didn't have any trouble with the learning function ( perhaps those that did weren't holding the remotes properly as specified in the manual ) . All my equipment is working perfectly with this remote . Give it a chance , return it if you encounter the problems others are mentioning . Haven't had to change batteries either , or maxed out the memory yet .  
1	  In short , I 'm disappointed with the quality of sound . Maybe Texas has too many stations , so it 's hard for me to find a decent transmission of sound . Even 88.1 is an actual station in my part of TX . I tried several other stations ; none where void of static , even though some had a lesser undertone than others . The hint of static was consistently present . It 's kind of frustrating because I have a sports car and I don't want a bulky transmitter , so stylish wise this was the most suitable . I even read several of the reviews that were favorable , but it did not work for me . I guess its back to the drawing board .  
2	  great case . not to big , not to small . also avail at wally world for same price minus shipping :(  
2	  Very nice product , easy to setup , and stylish . Some complaints about adjusting volume are valid but with persistence and holding tightly , the adjustment works fine . Highly recommended , nice looks , great sound .  
2	  PictureMate Deluxe Viewer Edition takes the personal photo lab one step further , making it even easier to view , edit and print glossy 4 " x 6 " photos . It measure 6 by 10 by 6 inches ( HWD ) , weighs 5.5 pounds , and has a handle . The Deluxe Viewer Edition also has a battery option . Setup is just as easy as with the original . Simply slide the single six-color ink cartridge-with cyan , yellow , magenta , black , red , and blue inks-into the slot in the back , load the photo paper , connect the power cord , and you 're ready to print from a camera , external CD or ZIP drive , a USB memory key , or any type of memory card , although you 'll need an adapter for miniSD cards and some Memory Stick formats . To print from your computer , the only additional steps are to connect by USB cable and run the automated install program . You can also add Epson 's optional Bluetooth adapter for wireless printing . It takes about 1 minute 19 seconds to 1:45 for each photo , whether printed from a computer , memory card , or camera . It uses ink and paper , which means the photos for the Deluxe Viewer Edition are also waterproof and smear-proof even immediately after printing , and they cost only 29 cents per print . Now this is the kicker , it is cheaper to print them at Sam 's Club for 12 cents per print , so I only purchased this because I can take it to scrap meets and print what I need when I need it . My other photos I send to Sam 's Club or even Wal-Mart for nearly the same price of 12 cents . This is more of a convince thing for me . I purchased this mode for only 24.99 at Target where it normally retailed for 199.00 but it was on super clearance . This is what you have to weigh in on , convince for the price or what your pocket book can handle . It has come in handy for me at times and the prints come out nicely so it is a tossup for people on a budget !  
2	  It was shipped fast and the battery itself was just as described . I 'd buy from them again .  
1	  I found that the SD500 fits snugly in the original Pentax PTX-L40 case , as offered by J & R. On the Pentax site they show a different case for the L40 , maybe they changed it , but the one shown at J & R is the one I tried - and it has a small pocket for an extra battery and memory card .  
1	  I have no idea what happened to it . It was playing perfectly . The quality of this CD player is better than any other player I 've ever owned . This morning , as I walked out to the bus , it refused to read my CD . Every other CD I tried either would not be read , took forever to be read and then shut off , or the player would skip almost every track and play a very few . Even with those few , the track would skip . I tried this with scratched and unscratched CDs , and it 's certainly not the CD . How long have I had it ? A week and a half . I 'm very upset , because it 's the best CD player I 've ever owned and usually , Sony players put up with all the abuse they go through in my life . This one ? Not at all . I 'm resorting back to my old one that is nearly in two pieces but still plays perfectly . Good luck with the Psyc ; I didn't have any .  
2	  I was looking for a portable disc drive to use periodically for our Acer netbook . This helps minimize the size of the netbook we use on a daily basis while still allowing us to use a disc drive when need be . Met our needs wonderfully .  
2	  The product worked as promised . I have a Dell Inspiron 600m bought in 2005 and my graphics card ATI Mobility Radeon 9000 did not work with similar converter i bought from radio shack for 24 $ . The converter from radio shack did work on my friends computer that was purchased on 2006 . I had an old graphics card and also ATI did not support Catalyst Control centre software for my graphics card . Read the reviews about this product and bought it . The quality is great and my computer detected my TV right away . This is a great product for such low price . And the shipping cost was also 4 $ . I bought 2 of them and they work as promised .  
2	  Just to clear up a misunderstanding with Drew 's review-he mentions that there is no headphone jack . I have this radio and have ordered several for my friends , and they all have headphone and aux . jacks on them . They can be found right behind the volume and bass knob on the top-back of radio ! You kinda have to look for it though . They are not easily viewable on the dark green surface of this particular model the JVC RV-B90 . But everything else Drew says I whole heartedly agree ! Get this BOOMBOX , all my friends rave about it !  
1	  If you 're looking for " plug and play simplicity " , keep looking ! The software didn't recognize the hardware . The manufacturere 's website listed some ways to almost get this to work . Sadly , almost is the closest I came . I e-mailed customer support and just got a response . Too late , this one 's going back .  
1	  I have enjoyed previous iHome products , but I am not happy about this one . I got this one because it was one of the only alarm clocks that had an aux / out port which is important for iPod touch users . The problem is that the alarm will use the iPod if it is plugged in and not the buzzer . The buzzer will go off if there is not iPod charging ( good luck if you just wanted to charge your iPod overnight . ) There is no way to tell it to always use the buzzer when you have an ipod on the charger . I will never buy a iHome product again because of this , I have wasted too much money on them .  
2	  I had these headphones sent to my mother , who loves all things pink after having seen Legally Blonde , but hates the in-ear buds that came with her pink ipod shuffle . I wanted to get her something that is easy to wear while walking , and remembered having seen a set of these in black , so I found pink here , on Amazon . She was a little skeptical , because she thought that they would be like the buds , only with ear clips , but she loves the sound and the way that these buds fit into her ear seems much more natural to her . These are perfect for someone who is looking for some headphones that are comfortable , inexpensive , and have some decent sound .  
2	  The ends took a little longer to get as one set was shipped from another supplier , but they are excellent quality and I will buy more if I get another set of wires that require them .  
2	  It 's really easy to use and the pictures come out so well .. I 'm a satisfied customer :)  
2	  I bought this camera right after it came out . It was recommended to me by my dealer , because I was looking for a digital camera with at least 4 mega pixels , that I could use on land and underwater , in a [ certain ] price range .. This camera has fulfilled all those requirements beautifully . Things I like about the camera : it 's compact , easy to use , has a lot of features that you don't even need to know in the beginning to get started . I started taking pictures right away by setting it to Auto . But as you want to learn more , the camera can do more . It 's very easy to use underwater . You turn it on , set it so that the it will power down after a minute of disuse , turn off the display to conserve the battery , pop it into its housing , run some silicon around the o-ring , and off you go . On a recent dive trip , I was able to take photos for two dives on a single battery . Then I 'd go back to my room for a bit of rest , change the battery , put some more silicon onj the seal and close it up again . I couldn't believe how easy it was . At the end of the day , I 'd go through my shots and delete the ones I didn't like . You can also zoom in on your photos in the display mode to take a close up look without having to hook your camera up to a computer . On land , I recently hooked the camera up to my tripod and took a family portrait with the timer setting . It takes action shots , low light shots , panoramic shots ( through stitching ) , hi resolution shots , low resolutions shots , you name it , this camera does it .  
2	  I bought it to replace the CMOS battery of an old PC that was losing the time . I waited six months to write the review and so far is working fine and without any issues .  
1	  Folks , The fastest the BEST DSLRs record at is about 15-20 megs a second . So , to have anything that writes at 40 megs a second isn't worth the extra money . Sure , you 'll dump your photos to your computer faster - but is having to wait 20 less minutes after a long shoot worth the cash ? If you 're an assignment photographer , you know exactly which shots you 'll be releasing - and you 'll pull those . Otherwise , you don't need a card this fast . Go with an Extreme II and get more for your money .  
1	  Right now 2 stars may be generous . I 've had these almost 5 years . They 've never been great . I get double-imaging even at 10x . Once you zoom , forget it . It 's like looking thru a Coke bottle . I understand that I may be able to collimate them , and I will try , but I thin they should have been adjusted @ the factory ! Even my 16 yr old nephew with teenage vision says they aren't good . He prefers the 50 year old set of Bushnells . They are sharper . 50 yrs old and clearer . I 'll adjust them best I can and keep them on the boat . If they fall into the lake I won't shed a tear . UPDATE : This weekend I collimated them as best I could . @ 10X I got rid of most of the blurriness / double-imaging . So they 're usable at least in this state . However once you zoom , everything becomes distorted again . If you need zoom binocs buy a high quality pair . I should have just bought a fixed zoom set and saved $ 20 .  
2	  It was worth the money , when I saw the cheap price I was a little skeptical but it was just what I needed it was shipped quicker then I thought it would be shipped . It worked to make my tv a high hd 1080 quality  
2	  This media works great , I had no problems , burnt really well and played back even better . The cases are top quality and open easily and stay closed . Very good product .  
1	  I bought this product thinking that it would be a good addition to my laptop . Wow .. I was wrong . To start off , I was surprised by the size of the product - It is bulky , requires an external power supply AND an external firewire converter that plugs onto the unit . Next after looking over the case , I could tell it was super cheap quality . The plastic and lid begged to be broken or cracked in a laptop bag . Finally I decided to try to burn some CD 's . After making 12 CD coasters , I packed it up and sent it back . The only successful burn I did was using the CDR that came in the box at a 2X burn speed . All my other tests failed . In addition , the Adaptec add-on that comes with Media Player didn't recognize the drive . I think Iomega needs to redo their drivers and fix a few things . This product is half-baked and needs to go back for reengineering .  
1	  The item does not conform to your ear and it is instead the other way around . So it either fits you are not , and not adjustable . So my ear was too small for it therefore I immediately returned the item .  
1	  The title should say it all , but I 'll elaborate a little . I also bought a pair of Shure E3c earphones and a pair of Etymotic ER-4P earphones . I tried the E3c pair first and was impressed . I fly a lot and mainly needed to block sound , but wanted good sound reproduction as well . On the return flight I tried the ER6i set , and the best word to describe the experience was " offensive . " The sound-blocking capabilities were weak ( at best ) , and the reproduction was , again , offensive . It 's possible that I needed a better fit or some adjustment , but my feeling was that since I had a pair that didn't require adjustment ( and much less maintenance over time ) , it wasn't worth wasting my time . The other thing that likely would have sold me on the E3c 's versus the ER6i 's - had the sound blocking and reproduction been equal - was that the Shure set came with a very nice round , zip-up hard case that allows you to wrap the cord around , whereas the Etymotic set came with a dumpy little pouch that required you to stuff the already flimsy wires of the headphones into it , leaving no hope of retrieving them later free of knots . As a side note , I didn't even open the ER-4P package , so I cannot speak to the fit , sound blocking or sound quality ( though I 've read they are amazing earphones ) . But since they were from the same company and had a similar ear flange that I didn't like with the ER6i 's , I felt that , because I was happy with the E3c pair , the chances that I 'd feel $ 150 happier with the ER-4P pair didn't seem likely .  
2	  The mighty 1200 will live on forever ! Yes , it does sound better than any CD player out there .  
2	  I " traded up " my Nikon 885 of two years for this one recently and I have not been disappointed . I particularly like the Best Shot Selector feature , which has rescued a great shot for me on many occasions . I do a lot of enlargements , cropping , etc . , and the resolution is amazing even at 11x17 . I 've experienced the same problems with the 4300 ( as well as the 885 ) that others have noted - lag time , lens cap , power consumption , redeye , etc . - but most are petty inconveniences rather than major problems . My advice to prospective buyers for this or any other upper midrange digital camera is : prepare to * study the manual * because it will only improve your comfort-level with the camera , not to mention the quality of your photos . The " point-and-shoot " label is misleading - it 's very user-friendly , but it 's also a complex piece of electronics that performs even better if you know how you use it properly . I 've taken thousands of photos around New York City over the past year with this camera , and I 've gotten a lot of enjoyment and satisfaction out of it . Invest in an extra battery pack , a high-end memory card , and go have some fun !  
1	  I have used Linksys products for networking home computers for some time now and with a few exceptions have been very pleased . The Linksys BEFW11S4 Wireless 4-Port Cable / DSL Router did not perform like the Linksys product descriptions claimed it would . I attempted to share a cable modem in a home network , but I could not get a connection from this device across a moderate sized house with interior walls constructed out of drywall . The the transmitter and reciever were separated by about 50 feet on opposite sides of this home and I could not get a connection on any of the 6 channels . I went as far as turning off the one wireless phone , even though it was not operating in the 2.4 gig frequency . The home owner did not know of any other wireless devices in his home . The adjacent homes were over 30 feet from the sides of this home and it has water to the rear .  
1	  Audrey and 3com have serious problems . Let me establish my background - I 'm an avid fan of the Palm series and now have a Palm VII having given my Palm 3x to my wife . The intuitiveness of the Palm and the research that went into it did not translate to Audrey . This thing was obviously designed without researching housewives and families with children and what they really need . Also , some of the ads and the original web site are / were misleading . What I think Audrey is good for - a synching station for a 2 palm couple . If your goal is to have a single place to view two calendars side by side - this will work . But if that is your goal - why pay [ this much money ] ? The positive reviews on this page sound like synching couples or 3com employees not families with kids . Now for the problems - calendar is full of quirks-you cannot create individual color coded schedules as originally shown in misleading ads-Audrey has its own schedule and then up to two palms have their schedules which are color coded . We have a family with 3 kids and were excited that each could have their own schedule . No dice . Synching with audrey requires that you mark each event you want to synch over one by one . And an event owned by the Audrey calendar can't synch to a palm pilot . Email is almost unusable - most attachments are two large for it . Stations is an abortion and appears to be a serious bug of the system . My station knob didn't work , 3com support said " bend it down-now it 's fixed ! " It wasn't - stations blow by like lightning and then the system locks with a browser memory error . Then you have to unplug it and half the time it doesn't boot up right . Oh , and when it does-you get to go through setup again . The browser seems OK though the screen is small but 3com touts the goofy feature of copying something from the browser to email to send to somebody else . That 's a non feature - get the customer 's needs down . To sum it up - the first hour my wife spent with this caused her to say " Uggh " with all the limitations ( there are many ) and kludginess and bugs . And finally - support is horrid . We had to send ours back and it 's been over a month with no word . When you call , they have no clue . To sum it up , the concept and promise were exciting and I see where it can go but it 's like expecting Albert Einstien and getting Trog .  
1	  cheap flimbsy and hard to use have to wear gloves so you dont get cut stay away go to your local stereo shop  
1	  this product doesn't have a good quality . it won't charge nicely . you 'll have to move the cord to a direction to let it charge . i wouldn't recommend this product to others . i think it 's kind of a waste of money . overall , fast shipping .  
2	  I used this camera on the beach quite a bit last month , and it performed just as I hoped it would . I swam with it a few times , and it survived the submersion with flying colors , even floating to the top a few times when it slipped out of my pocket . I wasn't diving or anything , but for submersion within 10 feet of the surface , it did fine . Can't speak to deeper use . I didn't use the camera to take underwater pics , but it did fine with pictures above water when wet . The resolution is obviously a far cry from what you can get with even the cheapest digital camera now , so you should go in aware that these aren't museum-quality prints or anything . But for what it is , this camera does fine . I also highly recommend buying the camera from Amazon . They 're not paying me to say this or anything , but I looked at local drugstores , and the exact same camera was literally 2.5-3 times as expensive . I can't for the life of me figure out why the mark-up is so high , but that 's what it is in the Washington , DC , area .  
1	  A lot of them did not work and went to the trash . It might of been a bad batch .  
1	  I purchased this Navman from Amazon . The Navman literature states that it is compatible with Palm OS 5.0 and higher . IT ISN'T ! I have the Palm Tungsten T5 which has Palm OS 5.4 . I have talked to people at the company and they admit it isn't compatible with Palm OS 5.4 . Also they have no idea when a " fix " will come out . They seem to have a don't care attitude . DON'T BUY THE PRODUCT .  
2	  This is the third Griffin iTrip that I have purchased , and all of the recipients have LOVED it . It 's the affordable way to listen to your iPod in the car . I would highly recommend it !  
2	  Unfortunately , the compant initially sent me the wrong product . I had to get ahold of them via email to let them know this . In respect to the company though , I must say that they took immediate action to send me the one that I really ordered , and they paid the shipping for it . I would have rather done business over the phone , but the company does not provide you with a customer service number nor a mailing address . This makes me wonder about the company itself . What are they hiding comes to mind immediately . No website either . Now , is it truly a universal mount ? No . If your Flat Panel TV does not have the VESA mounting patterns this mount will not work on it . Such is the case with my Toshiba Flat Panel . So this mount in its original form would not work either . But since I can weld , I made a mounting bracket ( Aluminium ) with a VESA pattern drilled into it that would fit the back of my TV . Then I mounted the universal moiunt to that . Added about an inch to the distance from the wall by doing this . But since I bought it to articulate the tv into a corner of the room , no big deal . The mount itself is well made and easy to install .  
1	  The print functions work fine , both color and text . It will scan from software , but it won't respond to scan requests from the control panel , which is the main reason I bought it . Thankfully , I did not waste money having this boat anchor shipped to me , I 'll just dump it off back at the store . I put a call in to tech support and he walked me through some tests , then gave up and said there must be something wrong with my pc . I tried installing the software on 2 different pc 's : 1 2003 server , the other xp pro sp2 , neither one allowed one touch scanning . In fact the xp machine didn't recognize the device at all .  
2	  I admit I was attracted to the Scepter x7g-Komodo LCD Monitor by its bargain price . I also admit I was a little concerned by one of the other user reviews that mentioned problems . I ordered the monitor anyway - and I couldn't be more pleased . First , Amazon operated with its usual efficiency . The vendor-Tiger Direct - was also outstanding . The Monitor arrived two days after it was ordered . The monitor was well packed and even survived what appeared to be a UPS " oops " incident . The instructions were clear with a very nicely illustrated manual . The monitor-as mentioned in other reviews - has speakers included . They are just okay . I am using my Polk Audio speakers instead . The display is beautiful . It was plug and play-no adjustments were needed . The images are sharp . Colors are awesome . If you want an LCD monitor and want to save some money - this is an outstanding choice .  
2	  I LOVE this radio and in fact I bought 2 .. one to give as a gift . However , after trying using it for a couple of weeks , I like it so much I am keeping both !  
1	  I was so excited to get this MP3 player , but have had several problems with it . It keeps freezing up on me which once caused it to overheat and then I LOST all the songs I had painstakingly put on it . I have used it two times since I purchased it at the beginning of January 2006 . I did not have a hard time putting the music on , it is just time consuming . When it works , it works well .  
1	  Very disappointed in this product . The product I ordered said it was USB adaptable . The one I recieved was capatable with windows 97 ! This product is over 14 years old ! So to say the least , it was not compatable with my windows XP laptop . So now I have a mouse that my daughter can't use . She was very upset ( she 's 3 ) and doesn't understand why it won't work .  
1	  Be warned that this version does not have expense tracking - one of the basic functions that many people ( especially repeat Palm customers ) expect to find on their handheld . And it is not easy to find 3rd party software that has down-loadable expense tracking software ( at least I haven't found it yet ) . What were these people thinking ? Or were they ?  
2	  Pros : easy set up , lightweight , not too big , backlit , good help menu on the LCD screen on the remote , very smart remote ! Cons : button layout is not the best , burns through batteriesLove this remote ! This is my first ' real ' Universal Remote so I do not have much to compare to . Set up was easy for me through the USB cable and online set up . just make sure you follow the large format , 1 sheet , fold out ' quick install guide ' manual the comes with . Write down all your components / devices Model numbers first , then install software , plug in the USB cable to the remote , register an account , and start the set up . pretty easy . NOT SURE WHY SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE SET UP ! IT 'S EASY ! Love using just one remote to control all my 5 devices ! This thing is smart and you tweak any of the buttons to do just about whatever you want them to do . I have only had it for two weeks when I wrote this , so I cant speak of how long it takes to eat the batteries , but I imagine with the LCD screen the batteries wont last long . but that is to be expected with any remote like this . just get good quality rechargeable AA 's . Buttons could be laid out better . would like the " prev " , " exit " , and " guide " buttons to be larger and located better . I picked this up new , from Amazon for $ 65 , so I got a great deal . I wouldnt pay more than $ 100 for this remote , but is a steal at $ 65 . all in all I luv it ! serves the purpose it was made for .  
2	  I 'm using these batteries for my xbox 360 controllers and they work great . Charge up overnight and they last for about 3 weeks or longer . My electric razor has lasted for over a month without a recharge of the batteries . It simply does as advertised . Fair price / works great . I liked it so much I had to buy another 4 pack of batteries for it ( comes with 4 ) . Give it about 7 hours to charge . I pop the batteries in over night and it cuts off automatically after they are charged . Charges AA & AA . LED indicator is a nice touch .  
2	  It 's a B + W filter what more is there to say , except they are pricey . I owned oneand gave it to my brother when I sold the lens that it fit . I also use Hoya , Pro1 Marumi MCand Vivitar Series 1 which are all excellent filters .  
2	  I have not bought one of these yet , but one is in our shopping cart to buy . After reading the reviews , my husband and I are deeply concerned and wanted to get out a safety message ! My husband is a class A contractor and we read in some of the reviews that people are placing these INTEX pools on decks ! PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS ! Even decks built to national building codes are only rated to carry so much weight , and these pools , when filled , weigh THOUSANDS . There was a case recently were a family placed their pool on a deck - they swam and brought the children in to dry off . When they went back out to get the wet clothes , THE DECK WAS GONE ! It had crashed from the weight of the pool , and fortunately the children were no longer in it . Please don't risk your and your childrens ' lives by placing this on a deck ! WOODEN DECKS CANNOT SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF A SWIMMING POOL.I will update on the quality of this pool when it arrives . In the meantime , enjoy your swimming pools , safely !  
2	  I have been a Philips fan for quite some time , and although this is just a simple cassette to listen to your ipod , it does the job very well . There was one brand that was a few dollars cheaper , but the quality of the Philips name persuaded me to go with them . I 'm glad I did and would certainly recommend this product .  
2	  Since this was my first time installing a wireless router , I was somewhat nervous if I could do it correctly and easily . Being a computer literate person that I am , I knew that installing the hardware was the easy part . But I was also pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it was setting it up wirelessly with my laptop . I definitely could have used this right out of the box wirelessly with my laptop , but I prefer to have certain security features turned on / off while I am online . And if you don't know what features to turn on / off , you can use the included CD to walk you through it . The size of this wireless router is very small . Its range is also very good for my small apartment . And so far , I haven't experienced any slowdown or loss of connection yet . In conclusion , I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive wireless router with standard features .  
2	  This new Panasonic brand battery breathed new life into my old wireless phone . I was ready to throw the phone out when it quit working ; but then I thought that just maybe it needed a new battery . Talk about rising from the dead ! This new battery was the salvation and saved me lots of time and money by not having to buy a new phone system . I wish all my electronics worked as well !  
2	  There 's been enough in depth reviews that I don't think I need to say much except as the price of LCD TVs fall , these are definitely the best TVs for the price . I was surprised to find out how many inputs there are , that the resolution isn't really low like you 'd expect for such a cheap TV , and that even if this weren't the best priced LCD it could still compete with plenty of bigger named brands . Great quality , price ( obviously ) , and even without the familiar brand name this purchase doesn't come with much risk due to the nice 1 year on-site warranty from Syntax . So maybe wait a few months for the 32 " model to fall below 1k ( 6/1/05 @ $ 1,500 ) and don't forget to register the TV .  
2	  I love my blue mini ! I have 800 songs on it ( 394 of them are Buffett ) and can't ever listen to them all . I love not having to deal with CDs , and Apple makes the swankiest and coolest player . Do yourself a favor and test these out before you decide to buy any other player .  
2	  I started out in 2005 with a 20D , at about the same time the 1ds MK II was released . Because this was a hobby of mine at the time , the 1ds mk II was way out of reach , both in terms of price , and due to the demand for good glass to go with it . I am used to the 20D 's AA filter , for me it is a normal part of the work flow to apply default sharpening at the end of the job in PS . For the dissapointed Kodak guy , I have to ask and point out two things ; - What glass did you use ? The 1ds MK II ( and the MK II even more so ) demand expensive , excellent glass . The large sensor and the resolution will put even the most expensive lenses to the test . - Did you apply default sharpening after post processing ? Canon state that a unsharp mask / smart sharpen of about 300 % 0.3px ( tweak when needed ) is necessary to combat the AA filter . If you do that , detail will jump out at you and make your jaw drop , seriously . For me the 1ds MK II experience has been a real treat . I bought mine summer 2007 , well aware that the MK II was due to be announced . For me , the small percentages in resolution didn't matter ( though the MKII , as a total package , is a step up from the MK II ) . The MK II creates wonderful photos . I have used mine for landscape , macro , studio , product and animals so far and I love every pixel i get . Prints looks great , my 70-200 f 2.8 finally saw use as a portrait lens again and my 17-40 really goes super wide for landscape . The menu system 's " idiot proofing " can be somewhat confusing at first and I miss my 20D control stick for the focus point selection , how ever ; When you have used it for a while , the handling become second nature . I don't need a " live view 42 " flat screen TV " on the back of my camera as the new DSLR 's have these days , draining the battery , so I am perfectly happy with the smallish one on the MK II . I use my screen for quick reviews / controls and to check the RGB histogram for exposure , the rest is done on the computer . I don't complain about size or weight and I don't see why one should when one is buying a camera one may use in a desert war - or to club down a potential mugger and take his photo afterwards . :) Seriously though ; If you don't want a heavy full frame camera , go for the 5D ( or the coming 5D mk II ) . I use my 1ds mk II with the 70-200 F2.8L , the 135 f2 L , 24-105 F4 L and the 400 5.6L and even though I get tired some times , I know that these various combos will produce pictures that will " aw " my clients . - Besides , a little work out is good for everyone in a time when people are getting more obese by the minute . I give it 4 out of 5 stars ( would give 4.5 if possible ) , deducting some of the points for the over complicated menu-control system as well as the missing control stick for the focus points . ( The 20D had it , and was released at the same time , so IMO the 1ds MK II should have had it ) . At the time I am writing this review , a used 1ds MK II can be had for about 50 % of it 's introduction price . If you are planning to step up from the 1D , 5D or the xxD / xxD series , I would recommend this camera with no hesitation . - Prepare to spend the money , saved on buying a used camera , on glass :)  
2	  This is a great solution for on the spot clean lenses and a spotless lcd .  
2	  We purchased this camera as a Christmas gift for our 10 year old son because he was always trying to borrow our " good " camcorder to make movies with his friends . He absolutely loves it . We got him a 512K disk to use , because the 32MB gets used up quickly . The only thing that is missing is a light . If he takes a movie in a room that is not brightly lit , the movie comes out dark . However , most of their movies are filmed outside in daylight , so the light is not too much of an issue . Also , the software installed easily and is simple to use . I would say this is a good buy .  
2	  In overall , i would say its pretty good , it does the job . It 's long , and transmits up to 100mbps , which is exactly what mine is , and that IS what i 'm getting . Connected it to my modem , to my airport extreme , and transmits its well . From my room , to my living room is about 45feet , so its worth it . The only thing that is dislike a bit of , is that the wire is pretty thick , but its not that bad to make this a 4star . As always , belkin is the best !  
2	  This was shipped immediately and arrived very quickly . Great service . Would recommend to anyone .  
2	  Use this with my Dj equipment works great ! worth buying ! dont waste your time buying these at best buy or Guitar center for like 12 bucks , when you can purchase them on here and save ! and plus my order came in fast !  
1	  Careful .. the filter comes in various sizes . When I ordered , it evidently defaulted to 52mm - not a good thing since my camera has a 55mm lens . In effect I bought a paper weight which offers UV protection . Don't let the same thing happen to you .  
2	  I hooked up my H4000 to a LCD projector which only has HD " component video " input , unlike other players like the Philips DVP5960 which enforce " High Definition Content Protection " ( HDCP ) rules which force HD output only on the HDMI out port , the H4000 upscaled flawlessly every DVD I wanted to play , over component video out to my NEC LCD projector . I have not tested MPEG4 , AVI or MP3 playback , as I only use legal , off-the-shelf DVDs . I recommend this player for those with LCD projectors or old HDTV sets ( made before 1996 ) which lack HDMI input ports .  
1	  Do not buy this item if you plan to use it continuously . It fell apart after about 2 months of use ( 50 plug-in plug-out cycles ) . It worked well originally , but soon the HDMI part of the adapter started bending and eventually fell out .  
2	  Nice product for the price , just can't figure out how to get more sound out of them .. Very heavy and well built a great addition to the speakers I already have .  
1	  sound is decent for the price , but the mini-plug broke after a month : the metal tip separated from the plastic housing . ( Don't know if getting fixed is worth the hassle . ) Wish they would make these of better quality .  
2	  The iPod Nano is great . Small , thin , and a very good sound quality .  
1	  Hi , Ok , so the camera was AMAZING the first two days until I dropped it into the toilet in its case . Now , obviosuly this is my fault . It dried out and I brought it in to a camera specialist who said it was fine but I feel the pictures were not as clear . So now it is just sitting here on my desk and I can't use my $ 400 camera . But the camera was great .. i don't recommend buying this porduct online . You can't send it or take it back .  
2	  If you need a 6 ' HDMI cable , this is it . As described , and it works as it should . Am I really so bored that I 'm reviewing an HDMI cable ? Yup !  
1	  I 'm on my fourth one , and I 'm about to demand my money back . Following is a summary of my experience with the Edge so far : Edge # 1 : dead on arrival Edge # 2 : backlight didn't work Edge # 3 : screws fell out Edge # 4 : gets hung up when synchronizing date bookEnough said .  
1	  Out of the box , the switch was not passing any sound . The seller , Antonline , directed me to the manufacturer ( Audiovox , owner of Terk ) for repair . Audiovox acknowledged the problem with the switch . Received the repaired or replacement switch in approximately three weeks . This time both the sound and the automatic switching were not working . Given the hassle , did not send it for repair again . I am currently using it as a manual switch without sound . Still better than unplugging cables , but definitely a poor quality product . Not recommended .  
1	  The radio was really well built and looked great . However it could not hold a station and was pretty useless as a radio .  
1	  I bought and Installed . I wanted to replace my 4 years old CompUsa G router with this N router . First I did the same setup as my old router My Internet worked with LAN connection . Wireless wise I had three laptop with G connection and two worked one dropped connection every few second . My VOIP phone did not work . I try to open the port through the setup for VOIP and did not work . I did research in the google and D-link site and look like many D-Link modem is having the same problem . I did my best to solve the problem and after two weeks I gave up and hooked up my old router all my Laptop and VOIP phone is working very well . I do not recommend this company router for any body .  
1	  Gosh , what a hassle ! I would not recommend this product to anyone ! It does not work with my dell laptop and the tech support folks are not helpful at all , they couldn't figure out why it 's not working with my laptop ( which I bought 6 months ago ) trust me , I am a ph . d student in computer science , and I couldn't get it to work .  
2	  I bought this item to protect my computer modem . Was glad to find one that had only one plug in .  
1	  Similar to other reviews . Loud clicking then dead . 11 months old . Wow . Definitely stay away from this product . If it were a car there would be a mass re-call .  
1	  2 hrs w / tech support & they say the unit is bad - return it . so I am returning it and have ordered the Hawking HWREN1 Hi-Gain Wireless-300N Range Extender .  
2	  Functional , but not my favorite snagless design . The rubber half-boots over the cable ends interfeer with the removel of this cable . This is not a problem if you 're not taking the cable in and out like I do , or if you never have the cable in a tight connection like I do . There are better designs , like the ones with an additional piece of plastic covering the connection from the opposite direction .  
2	  What do you call people like me ? Photo-aspirants ? I 'm not a professional photographer . But I shoot images all the time , sometimes a dozen or two a day , trying to create a picture other people will find curious , entertaining , weird , surprising , silly , shocking : " refrigerator-quality , " I guess . Kris Hermanns told me her mother had a device like this , that printed postcards from digital cameras . I bought it on that slight recommendation . I had a new Canon PowerShot A620 . I had a trip to France on the calendar . Kismet . I 've always used film . I was a film snob : I wanted beautiful images . The first photo that came off this Selphy CP730 printer blew me across the room . The color was intense , perfect , gorgeous ; and in my hand in less than a minute , printed on glossy stock with a postcard back . I compared it to a film print and couldn't tell the difference . It was this printer , in fact , that convinced me that digital photography was as good as film . Not just " as good as " - better , because of the control you have over color . Anybody want some aging , unexposed film ? I 've never gone back . My system ( which I sometimes pack up and travel with ) includes my Canon digital camera , the Selphy printer , my MacBook loaded with iPhoto ( which allows me to manipulate ) . It 's a seamless , no-issues production process . I often pump out a half-dozen curious images a day , to send to friends , colleagues , family . It keeps me in touch with them at low cost . When we have our big summer party , I 'll also use the Selphy to print out the invitations ( created in Photoshop , so I can add text ) . I sent a Selphy to my sister-in-law , Aimee , who IS an art and professional photographer ; and she loves it , too .  
1	  I ordered the bag for the mbp 17 and it was horrible . the " protection " area could have fit 3 of my computer . it was swimming around ! no protection at all . I ordered it from radtech , and they were rude , mean , nasty people who don't stand by thier product . don't believe anything they say .  
2	  I love this little device . It has nice expandability with both USB and Firewire . My favorite feature is the front USB / Firewire ports ! I can plug my USB SD card reader and external USB devices in quickly - to the work - and then unplug . No Noise , No Heat - just sits there and works . It would be better if it had a memory card reader in it as well - but that is fine .  
2	  Adapter is perfect for my needs for my older HP iPAQ device . Some older product parts are hard to find . Glad I found this one .  
2	  If any of you own a CD recorder for a stereo like the Philips ones , this CD is perfect to use . I currently use these CD 's to record with my Philips recorder and they work very well in my car , my portable and other CD players . There is an occasional skip but otherwise these CD 's work great !  
2	  It shipped on time and works great with are lap tops and computers . Much better than our last one  
1	  The amazon site brought up this card for accessories for my Canon rebel XT digital camera . It is the wrong disc . Because I opened it , their vendor , Adorama , would not exchange it . I never would have bought it if it hadn't come up on their site . If I go now the right card does come up , but something I did atthe time directed me to this card . It was not clear that for my large purchase order that they were splitting my order to three vendors ( part of that hidden price gig they 've got going on ) until you go to summarize the order for putting your charge number in . By that time , I 'd spent enough time with the whole thing , though I didn't kknow anything about the other vendors . I would have been better off getting accessories like memory cards locally . I guess I 'll have to sell it on eBay . I 'm quite discouraged with the Amazon process for this type of purchase . Next time I 'll stick to books .  
2	  Did a Great Job ! I was very happy with the product . The packaging was interesting , but very fitting for the item . I would definitely purchase from these folks again !  
1	  Connected to my computer , XP sees the device but ( despite what the manual says ) it would not give access to it ; keeps asking for the driver . Smartdisk site says no driver required , when you try to get tech support , you have to register , but the site does not recognize your user-id if you do register . Recommendation : Stick to western digital , maxtor or other recognized brand .  
2	  This camera is great value for the money . The 6x zoom is great , the image stablization works very well . It doesn't have some manual settings ( exposure etc . ) , max exposure you can set is 8 seconds in night scenery mode , so some dark night pics can get pretty grainy . But anything with decent to great light is terrific . The lcd itself shows grainy images occasionaly , i think that 's because of lower resolution , but the images turned out great . just bought it for $ 230 and jandr . Pretty fast camera too , don't have a high-speed hd card . very easy to use interface , and all preset modes give info on how to use them . Plastic body doesn't seem like a problem , but i 'd recommend getting some kind of a case since the lcd is completely unprotected . very light with the 2 aa batteries too .  
2	  I am a student at ITT Tech , I bought this so I could so I can do my Cisco labs with my laptop . Installed the drivers on Windows 7 and started up Hyper Terminal ( copied from a Windows XP machine ) and I was configuring a router with my classmates . USB is almost 20 years old why is Cisco still using RS232 for the console connection ?  
2	  When I bought this , I wasn't buying for the actual UV protection ; I just wanted to put something between the glass of my ( rather expensive ) lens and the ground should I accidentally drop the camera . However , since I put this on the lens , I have noticed a marked increase in the quality of images that I get out of the camera . Green and blue casts seem all but gone , and everything just generally looks sharper . For the price , I couldn't ask much more . I can't recommend it highly enough .  
2	  These work well . For the amount I paid for them ( $ 5 ) I would definitely recommend them .  
1	  You can buy the same thing from Monoprice for a fraction of the cost , $ 31 !  
2	  i had this for awhile and it serves me good still . i can fit 2 cameras in there , Nikon N80 and a manual Canon , with 2 lens . enough pockets to store few films and such and even a small p & s digicam . i dropped my bag few times and bumped it against few things while shooting in nyc but nothing happened to the cameras . strong bag . ONE downside is that , perhaps because i had so many things in the bag , that the top part of the cover ripped while i was carrying it by the handle . i just stapled it back . other than that , it 's really good .  
1	  Can not keep CD player in my Nissan Maxima'97 right way . Manual instruct me to make a holes in the original car CD player 's frame using hummer and flattener to keep automarket radio . Not happy .  
1	  within one hour of playing my ps3 this cable died on me for what i paid for it i am not requesting to return the item but i would buy another one of them .  
1	  These earbuds are not total junk but only have a few redeeming qualities . Believe me I own a pair of $ 350 Denon AH-D2000 headphones and they are gorgeous-sounding , I just don't know what Denon was thinking when they were making these things . Pros : 1 . Great sound isolation2 . Long cable w / 3.5mm extender , uneven for around-the-neck style listening3 . Different silicone cap sizes included4 . Something at least better than iPod stock headphonesCons : 1 . Silicone caps are WAY too soft and feel like paper , no tight air seal in ear ( to be fair to the sound quality I changed the caps with another earbud set for maximum bass ) 2 . Sound quality ( AFTER I changed out the silicone caps ) : WEELY bad . Believe me I am an audiophile but a relatively tolerant one - and these are unbearable . But these aren't your stereotypical non-bass earbuds - these have plenty of bass except that instead of a deep , tight , punchy bass , this bass has NO punch whatsoever and merely rumbles around . Strange enough , there is virtually no midrange on these headphones - so vocals sound like squealing , and combined with the symbols and drums of your average Owl City or country song immediately sounds like tinfoil in the rain and even starts to HURT your ears after a while because of how sharp the treble is . 3 . Rubbery cable bounces around like an angry chihuahua during exercise , and pulls down on your ears and pops , practically drowning out all the music coming from your iPod4 . Pretty dam expensive for what you get in the box .  
1	  There seems to be a glitch in Amazon . com 's system . I 've ordered these directly and through several " new and used " distributors listed here .. and I always get standard tapes instead of silver . AVOID !  
2	  I don't think it is possible to find a better multimedia speaker deal for under $ 40.00 . The speakers set up easily and , despite their looks , can stay fairly inconspicuous . I have mine set up on top of our armoir withsome decorative plants to hide the sub . I am using this with the excellent AirPort Express to pipe my iTunes collection into the living room .  
2	  I am not a veru techie kind of person or a professional photograph . I bought this lens for my CANON EOS 500D Rebel T1i . It works well with it . Or I would say it 's pretty good for an amateur like me . The pictures come out sharp & clear .  
1	  I purchased this LCD new in Oct . I had problems with the picture immediately . A tech came out and could not fix the problem by inserting a new board . Next the TV set " died " no power , picture or sound . Panasonic customer service is awful , awful , awful . I have tried repeatedly to get the set replaced to no avail . I have called time and time again and received nothing but the run around . I am now waiting for a power board to come in . It will take 30 additional days . I have owned a $ 1,700 for 5 months and it has worked for 30 days . Panasonic customer support is a joke ! I would not purchase any Panasonic product again . I would suggest buying a company that stands behind their product . If anyone wants a more detailed review feel free to contact me . @ auciello @ tampabay . rr . com  
1	  After two hours on the phone with customer service people with attitudes , I realized I bought a piece of junk and plan to order a brand new broadband router from another company . What a waste of my time and money . In a nutshell , this router did not work . All I wanted to do was hook up the router to one desk top and one laptop . The customer service rep , whom I could not hear because the line was breaking up because I guess it was overseas and I could not understand because of her heavy accent , told me I needed win zip to upgrade my router . When I told her I didn't have one , she said I should go to the computer store , buy Win Zip , and use it for the 30 day trial . I should download it on my laptop . Then I should return the software telling the store that I 'm not satisfied with it . I couldn't believe what I was hearing . I repeated it back to her , saying that she wanted me to buy software and return it because I needed it to upgrade my defective Linksys router ? Basically , she was asking me to lie and steal from a store ? She said yes , it 's not a big deal . I couldn't believe it . I will never buy another Linksys product again . Defective product and extremely unprofessional . I would have given zero stars if that was an option .  
1	  You camera will record audio better WITHOUT this microphone . Luckily I bought it locally and will be returning it .  
1	  In March 2012 I purchased a classic 80gb ipod from this seller . I received the ipod in the beginning of March 2012 , and after using the ipod about 5 times the ipod froze and a big red X appeared on May 15 , 20012 ( only about 2 months of having the ipod ) . I immediately went onto apple 's website and followed the instructions to fix it . Unfortunately the red X still appeared . So I took my ipod to a ipod repair shop and I was told by them and apple that the hard drive was bad and the harddrive for this ipod is $ 99.00 plus labor for installing the hard drive . I am very upset and feel ripped off because I paid $ 119.00 for an ipod from this seller , only had it for 2 months and used it 5 times . I contacted the seller about 13 days ago and seller has not responded . I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN . I have purchased tons of items from amazon 's website and this is the 1st bad review haven't had to write .  
1	  I am the unhappy owner of several H10 's and initially there were no problems , but the closer they got to the end of the one-year warranty , the more problems they all started having . Problems include freezing up for no apparent reason , scrolling in Chinese , and the most irritating is when the " system files are missing " and you have to reinstall the firmware and redownload ALL of your music . The company doesn't believe in customer service - you can't get through on the phone and they take days to respond to email . I have returned two because the hard drives crashed and it took 3-4 weeks to get them back , and then one of them crashed again as soon as I got all the music redownloaded and I had to return it and wait another 3 weeks . I have a problem with one that has now gone out of warranty and iRiver told me they won't touch it and to look for a repair shop online . So save yourself alot of headaches and time , not to mention money , and don't buy an H10 player .  
2	  THIS ITEM HAS GREAT SOUND QUALITY . IT HAS THE BEST SOUND QUALITY OF ANY OF THE MICROCASSETTE RECORDERS , I HAVE TRIED . THIS PACKAGE OFFERS YOU THE MOST IMPORTANT OPTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED , TO OPERATE EASILY AND EFFECTIVELY . THESE RECORDERS ARE NOT FOR RECORDING MUSIC , BUT FOR RECORDING VOICE . THIS ONE DOES IT EXCEPTIONALLY WELL.I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THIS UNIT AND IF YOU PURCHASE ONE ? I AM SURE YOU WILL ALSO BE IMPRESSED !  
2	  I bought this camera to take pictures of my family and friends . I have had if for more than one year , and it has performed above expectations under all conditions . The 1 minute video feature is great , and was an unexpected bonus ( since I didn't know about it when I bought it off Amazon ) . The camera works great with iPhoto and MacOS X. I bought a 512 MB card for it and so far it has been great . Both my father and my father in law have the previous Powershot S400 and they have had no problems with it . I figure at some point I 'll have to change the battery , because Lithium-Ions lose 20 % capacity per year , but so far it has worked flawlessly .  
1	  This is a very bad bug zapper . Although it worked fine for a week , it the proceded to die . This happened with TWO new units . No rain , no bad weather , just a piece of junk .  
1	  This product might fit other XBox 360 's but not a first generation . I will not plug into the power supply block . Bummer ..  
2	  I got this modem to replace the RCA modem I was renting each month with broadband service . So far I have been happy with it . It seems to be faster than the old modem .  
1	  Sennheiser is one of the better known names in headphones . Their sound quality is excellent . I thought that their wireless headphones would be excellent as well . They were , for about 6 months . Then they just stopped working . No clues to the problem . Possibly the battery ?  
2	  I 've been using this drive for almost a year now moving files back and forth from work . Most of the files are Word documents , pictures , music and some movie files . I have never had a problem with this drive and love the large size . The drive is durable and reliable . The speed seems pretty decent also but I don't have a lot of others to compare it to . The only con I have experienced so far is that the rubber housing sometimes makes it too big to fit into a usb slot if that slot is really close to another usb slot that already has something plugged in . This drive needs it space . But for me it hasn't been a problem because I 'm generally plugging it into my usb hub .  
1	  HP printer doesn't recognize the cartridge . Had to replace all cartridges with new ones over $ 80 to make it work again .  
1	  Had some issues setting up . Worked with Belkin support to resolve . 1st support call did not resolve problem but second did . Had to reset settings . Now I have used it for a couple of months and have to unplug it just about every time I use it to reset the system . Should have read the 108 - 1 star reviews before I bought . Most seem to have the same problem . Total Junk .  
1	  Broke after 2 months of use . froze up . Called customer service . Was no help . poor quality . can hardly see screen . would never purchase sandisk again .  
1	  ordered a dual link got a single link . emailed , sent back to get the right product and have never got it back . Been two months now . How do you mess that up ?  
1	  It 's quite disappointing that the black pack which carries the manuals , cleaning cloth and the MacOS DVD 's doesn't have the DVD 's in it on my new Macbook Pro purchased :( Amazon , please send me the original DVD 's ASAP  
1	  The battery fits , yes .. but when the camera is turned on , a few seconds later the words " for Info LITHIUM battery only " will appear before it shuts off automatically . It does not work , at least not for my camera .  
1	  I bought this product at a major chain office supply store . Tried to install it but was unsuccessful . Reason being 2 of the 4 bolts that hold the monitor to the mount broke . Went to the local hardware store and bought more of the same bolts . Finally hung the monitor on the wall and the mount sagged . Tried to tighten the mount so the monitor would stay level . This time a major hex bolt broke . The product is made of inferior metal and is very difficult to be useful . I tried to contact the company who made this product since it comes with a 10 year warranty . The company is no longer in business . I would not buy again nor would I recommend to others .  
2	  Folks , I was very concerned about this remote because of all the bad reviews , but after reading the reviews on epinions , it showed me how to use this remote better than the manual could . I can now recommend this remote . This remote has an XML back-end which is really an amazing step forward in technology and very customizable ; and with a bit of patience and clear instructions , this remote delivers very well . Before you discount this remote from the other negative reviews , read this detailed review BELOW which helped me : " by chrisellTo program the unit , the software wizard steps you through a learning process . I 'm told that it works quite well if it actually recognises your old remote . To do this , it will ask for a certain button to be pressed - play , power , something like that . Then it searches it 's available preset device list for a matching code and configures the remote to match . Only it doesn't always work . Actually in my case , it didn't work for any of the 4 remotes I wanted to teach it . I 'm not sure why but maybe if I 'd installed the firmware update first , it would have been different . Given that it couldn't find any of my devices , I had to do each one by hand . A bit laborious , but not too bad , and I had 100 % success rate when doing it manually . Basically , the software steps through all the keys it thinks you 'd want to use for the type of device you 're programming , and asks you to fire your old remote at the new one so it can learn the infra-red code . At the end of this you have a roughly-configured set of keys . I say roughly , because this is where the fun starts if you 're a tinkerer like me . Once you get to the ' advanced ' settings , you can pretty much make this thing do anything . All the buttons in the advanced view are colour-coded to let you know if they 've got a predetermined code on them , a learned code or an alias to another key elsewhere in the remote . Keys that don't have a colour assigned to them are blank and waiting to be used . The process of manually learning codes from the advanced screen is a bit odd and the helpfile is bloody useless ( you 'll find that comment about this remote in ALL the reviews ) . Knowing how these reviews get propagated around the internet , I thought a quick how-to might be worth including here : From the advanced screen , click the button for the device you want to customise and click " Edit Buttons " . The software brings up a picture of the remote . Click the button you want to learn a code for and then click " Edit Actions " . This is where the helpfile falls apart but it 's actually pretty easy . On the ' Edit actions ' screen there 's another ' learn ' button right at the bottom - click it and go through a manual learn process for that one button and voila - done . The ' Edit actions ' screen is also where the real power of the RM-AX1400 comes into play because here you can assign aliases to any other key already programmed and add delays . You can also stack up codes , aliases and delays together - effectively ANY key on the remote can become a macro . Clever , and nice for the technically-minded , but this precise feature is why this remote might not be great for the people who just want to pick it up and go . There 's been a little discussion here and there on the remote forums about the Jump function of this remote . Simply put , it just changed the display and remote key functions . So for example if you want to create a macro to watch a movie , you can power on your DVD , power on the receiver , power on the TV , set the receiver to the DVD input and then Jump the remote to the DVD settings . It 's a nice touch and it means that when you hit the " movie " macro , everything turns on and the remote ensures it 's in DVD mode when the macro is complete . Most of the keys that you program can be assigned a name that shows up in the middle line of the OLED display when you push the button . One thing that 's a little irritating is that by default , only the outer two of the soft buttons can be programmed for any device , and by default , they have their labels set to POWER and INPUT . There 's no way to change this in the software , however , if you 're not afraid of a little XML programming , your remote 's configuration is all stored in an XML file called urmgui . xml . The way to manually override the default labels is to set everything up the way you want it , then assign some easily-identifiable name to the softkey you want to rename , like " ZZ1 " . Save the file out of the software and then open up the XML file in a text editor and search for " ZZ1 " . You 'll find an XML button definition with two labels . The first label is the 6-character softkey label - the one that defaults to " POWER " or " INPUT " . The second label is the name you can enter that shows up in the middle line of the display - in this case " ZZ1 " . Change both to be what you want and you 're done . Why all this detail ? Well my projector , for example , has a power button on the remote that turns the projector on . But to turn it off , you need to push the button , wait a moment for the confirmation on the screen , then push it again . So I assigned the two soft keys so that one was " power on " which issued the remote code once , the other was " power off " which issued it twice with a half-second delay in between ( using the advanced editor functions ) . The problem was that one label said " POWER " and the other said " INPUT " so I changed them in the XML file to say " PWRON " and " PWROFF " . So apart from all the nauseating technical detail , what 's it like to use ? Well apart from the slightly odd form factor which makes it a bit clunky for smaller hands , it 's a delight to use in a darkened room to control a home theatre system . All the buttons are logically placed , and a user-configurable beep lets you know you 've pushed the button and it 's sent the remote code . The buttons have a slightly squishy sensation to them but I prefer this to the horrible ' click ' on the Harmony remotes . Unlike the Logitech Harmony remotes that have a weird delay on the volume controls , I can press and hold the volume controls on the Sony and my receiver smoothly ramps the volume up and down - something I could never get my Harmony remote to do . A couple of the buttons you 'd expect to be illuminated , aren't , which is a bit of a mystery . Like the ' menu ' button . Fortunately , it 's placed right next to the arrow keys so it 's easy to memorise its location , and that in essence is what makes this remote so nice for me - hard buttons . I don't need to look at the remote to know where the keys are . Philips Prontos are all very nice , but you always have to look at the screen to see what the buttons do . With the Sony , it 's like a well-laid out TV remote , even if it is a bit brick-like . One last feature worth mentioning - the software has a backup facility which stores a binary dump of your remote on to your PC for safekeeping . So if you 're messing around with the software and screw everything up , you can restore the backup and start again . So would I recommend this ? I answered ' yes ' to the epinions question and gave it 4/5 stars . It drops one star because my ' yes ' answer really only applies for people who are technologically savvy and willing to give this remote the time it deserves to get the most out of it . Honestly if you want a " plug'n'play " type remote , you 'd probably be better off looking elsewhere . "  
1	  broken when recieved it-led didnt work so you cant see the channel your on-it turns on but thats about all  
2	  If you are looking for a large power strip with plenty of space for tons of power adapters and plugs , this will do you perfectly fine . In my experience there isn't much variation between power strips , but this one looks quite nice , works perfectly fine out of the box , and fits plenty of stuff . Worth the money .  
1	  The Griffin TuneJuice 2 Battery Backup for iPod is deemed by most reviewers as pretty lame as a battery extender and charger . But there is an alternative , and it is quite good in terms of performance and value . It is called Music Power 0900-72 Encore Dual Port USB AC Charger with Rechargeable Extended Battery . It is not a one-piece design like the Kensington Mini Battery Extender and Charger , but because of that , it is more flexible ( It 's a general purpose portable / AC 2-port USB charger ) and will allow me to continue my Skype session without interruption . In other words , I can CHARGE my iPod Touch and USE my headphone / microphone at the same time . Not only that , there is no issue with having to remove iPod Touch 's protective case if you have one , or having to maintain a certain angled contact between the battery and the iPod for positive charging to take place . For me , this is a much better and more practical solution to extending the use of my iPod Touch . And it is also cheaper than the Kensington , plus you will most likely be able to use this battery on future versions of iPod and things that rely on USB power . I highly recommend it ( Music Power 0900-72 Encore ) .  
1	  I had this TV for 1 year 1 month and now it will not turn on . It had very good reviews and I got a killer deal on it but now it doesn't work . I woke up this morning and hit the power only to have it flash 7 times at me . By doing an internet search for " panasonic power light flash " you can find that 7 flashes mean that internal boards need to be replaced . The manufacturer warranty is only 1 year so I find it convenient that this happened on month outside the warranty . If you buy this TV I hope you also buy the extended warranty that some places offer .  
1	  I bought it at Radio Shack and after carefully using it in my car for about 5 or 6 times , the cable that connects the audio output to the device , broke . I was so surprised that I sent it to the Customer Service of iRock asking for it to be replaced or repaired . Well , that was three months ago and of course I haven't heard from them .  
2	  I own a couple of APC UPS and surge protection products . So far this is the most functional . The features : 1 . The unit can be positioned vertically ( best for saving space ) or horizontally ( lay flat or mounted to a server rack ) . 2 . It has a very excellent boxy design that gives an elegant and modern feel . 3 . There are 8 outlets in total ( 6 outlets are battery protected and voltage regulated , which means less dependency on the battery and longer replacement life ; 2 outlets are surge-protected for printers and office machines ) . 4 . The included PowerChute Personal Edition is to be combined with the data cable that , when connected to your computer via USB , provides excellent control and communication between the UPS , computer and user / administrator . a . You will know exactly how much load is taxing the UPS in real-time ; Turn on / off equipment to check . b . Shut-down function to preserve data or battery . c . Audible and visual alarm indication on current condition . 5 . Hot-swap battery without turning off the UPS . The cons ? Heavy ! But then of course it only needs to be set and forget . Expensive ! Not for a typcial user . Although the features should be made available for everyone . This particular model is a little overkill . I connected a P4 3GHz ( with 3 internal SATA HDD , DVDROM , DVD-RW ) , 21 " CRT , Apple PBG4 laptop , 2 external LaCie HDD and 1 external CD-R and I still haven't reached half of the available power . Buy this only if they offer a special price / rebate . Otherwise , go with the lower model XS / RS1000 and it will suite an power user just perfectly .  
2	  Pros : excellent tracking on a variety of surfaces , especially for fps games such as UT2004 ; buttons work great ; wheel works great for both scrolling and clicking ; has lasted me 4 years and countingCons : a tad bulky for small hands , for which the Logitech MX310 might be a better choice ; side buttons should be shifted inward ; feet may peel off on hard surfaces  
2	  This scanner is very definitely a five star item . We tried out many scanners . Some came with software that was difficult , or confusing in instructing the operator to use . If time is any consideration some seemed to poke along . Some were quick but the images produced were not always clear . Some scanners were noisy . Some bulky . This little baby is thin , sleek , easily portable , quick , and the 42 bit gives one excellent reproduction . If one has a digital camera , I think that is an especially important consideration .  
1	  The sound quality of these earphones is really good . I was very pleased with my purchase until about 4 months ( 1 month past warranty ) into them , when I noticed bare wire on the cord in two places . The cord is very cheaply made and doesn't seem to stand up to the normal wear and tear . I love the sound quality , but the cord problem can present a serious problem .  
1	  For about 9 months this has been a great firewall / print server / router switch . Very fast and easy to set up via a web browser . Newer firmware features really enhance this product . However , beware of hardware failure in time . It seems that Netware routers have a very cheap capacitor that fails frequently in time . ( There is the telltale test lite that remains on after a reset , and the odor of a burned out electronic component ) Why do I say this ? I have had two netgrear firewalls fail in the same way within a month of one another - this FR114P and the similar FM114P ( essentially the same unit with built-in WAP ) . Great features - all that I wanted and needed , easy setup ( within minutes ) , but terrible quality . Now I have to decide which of the competitive brand firewalls I should buy .  
2	  Recently bought this unit as an upgrade . I really prefer a multi-disc changer with a random function , versus a single disc player , as a way to mix up some favorite discs . The audio is simply excellent . I am hearing all the detail I would expect in a high-end single disc player . I note very little noise from the unit as the discs change , and silence through the speakers as this occurs . As others have mentioned , check the dimensions on this one relative to your cabinet , because it 's a legit 17 " x 17 " .  
2	  With keyboards costing as little as $ 10 these days , it is quite interesting that Logitech would market a $ 200 device . When first considering this purchase , I began to wonder if consumers were merely running out of computer accessories to buy and needed an outlet by acquiring superfluous peripherals . Yet , I was willing to take a chance as I spend 10 + hours per day in front of a computer . For me , any productivity enhancement is worth the investment . And that is exactly what I got with the diNovo Edge . Like most users , I have grown accustomed to notebook keyboards as their keys have a much smaller travel than those on desktop keyboards . For me , I am simply able to type faster . The shallow keys were initially what attracted me to the diNovo Edge . As such , I have been very happy with the keyboard 's feel . Moreover , it is probably the fastest desktop keyboard I have ever used . Another feature of importance is its Bluetooth connectivity . My notebook has integrated Bluetooth , making setup in the morning a rather brief activity . Nine of ten times , my Dell XPS notebook recognized the keyboard without a hitch . In fact , even the initial setup was relatively easy . However , I would recommend * NOT * using the CD included as Logitech has made several revisions to the Setpoint software . Download the latest version from the Logitech web site . Even if you don't care about the additional features , Logitech tech support will always tell you to install the latest version of the software if they can't figure out what is wrong with your setup . This leads to one of my biggest irritations with my user experience . When pressing the Caps Lock key there is beep . Disengaging the Caps Lock key creates another beep with a different tone . The Setpoint software has a setting to toggle this audible alert on or off . However , it doesn't work with this particular keyboard . After installing and uninstalling different versions of Setpoint four times , I contacted Logitech tech support . What was really irritating is the representative wanted me to reinstall it again in safe mode . I finally gave up when someone on the Logitech user forum , who appeared to be an employee , said that the toggle did not work - for now . There are some other shortcomings with the diNovo Edge that the buyer should be cognizant of before purchase . Most obviously , it lacks a number pad . This can be issue for some users . As I am accustomed to notebook keyboards , this isn't a big problem for me personally . What is a daily irritation , however , is the mirror surface of keyboard shell . It attracts fingerprints more easily than any opaque surface I have even seen . It requires constant polishing with the enclosed cloth or with tissue - if you care about its appearance . Clearly , Logitech engineers knew this was going to be a problem given they included a piece of velvety material to remove smudge marks . Despite the price and shortcomings , the diNovo Edge was a worthwhile purchase . Additionally , I consider it a good value from both an overall quality standpoint as well as in a return on my investment through productivity gains . If you spend a great deal of time typing and are looking for an extra " edge " , I would suggest acquiring this keyboard . ProsPrecision keysBuilt in lithium-ion batteryCharging cradleAesthetics ( sans fingerprints ) ConsNo keypadMirror surface easily attracts fingerprintsUncontrollable beeping when depressing the Caps Lock key  
2	  I bought this for my son who worked as a journalist intern this summer for a small town newspaper . He was taking a lot of his own photos and needed a camera bag that was something he could use for his slr camera but also like a briefcase . This bag was perfect . Most camera bags are either for the professional and over kill or too smallHe loves this and it was a fantastic value ! Shipping cam quick too .  
1	  I have tried to order this item twice , each time the vendoe cancels my order saying they won't deliver to my address . I order from Amazon all the time never had a problem with delivery before .  
1	  Got them working . Sound is OK , but there is some intermittent static . the signal sometimes fades ( which leads to losing sound and gaining static ) . Bad part is the " tuner . " You essentially turn a rotary dial on the transmitter to transmit to a certain channel ( although you never know which one , just turn til something works ) . After tuning the transmitter you have to tune the receiving speakers as well which has a similar rotary knob . If you can't get a good , steady signal you just play with the knobs until something works . Can be very time consuming and may not work for everybody depending on the electronics in your house and what your house is made from ( might interfere with the signal ) . Also , what works for one speaker ( knob location wise ) might not work with the other speaker . I got the first speaker to tune in almost perfectly about 5 seconds after turning it on . 10 minutes later i 'm still working on getting the second speaker to get as good of a signal . It would have been MUCH better if you could just select something like chanel 1 through 11 via something that " clicks " so you know you are exactly on the right channel and dont have to mess with 3 different knobs to get all 3 pieces of hardware to work together . I gave the product 2 stars instead of more because of the difficulties in getting a good , strong , steady signal that didn't break up . If the signal had been steady I would have given the product a good 4 stars because the sound is quite acceptable ( if you can get it tuned in well ) .  
1	  I bought two of these for my daughters ages 5 and 10 . They never damaged them or misused them . They loved them . That is all the good I am going to write . They battery was heavy and took a long time to recharge . Both chargers died at the same time . Tried finding a new charger and could not . I also tried finding a web site . Found it but is was not fully operational . Would not reccomend this item to anyone . I returned both and will look for a different DVD player . [ .. ]  
2	  When I first saw the specs on these headphones I was impressed . Never had I seen such a wide frequency response , and having owned Sony headphones before and having been satisfied I ignored the price tag and purchased them . Look , they sound great but you need to use them for a while before you get used to them and before they really begin to sound good . My advise , get them but give them some time !  
2	  When you by BOSE you won't get hosed ! All their products are superb , never had a bad one so far !  
1	  Was on my way to Best Buy to buy a different entry level camera as a gift but stopped across the street first at Costco to buy a box of AA batteries to include with the gift . Stumbled on this neat little camera and was blown away by the feature set . Ended up buying two - the other was for me since I was looking for a decent smaller camera to take with me on my frequent business trips . After 3 weeks , I finally returned it . I tried to reconcile the fact that it was such a good deal but I just didn't think it met Fuji standards . I think they simply crammed all sorts of features you typically see in much higher end cameras but didn't really maintain the same quality levels . I own a Fuji A400 and a more sophisticated S5100 as well as a couple of nice Olympus cameras and really expected more . The LCD screen is misleading because photos look decent there but wait until you see them on a full size computer screen . The best shots are made using the AUTO mode without zoom and taken in bright daylight . The things that bugged me the most were the zoom , both optical and digital ( too blurry ) , the proprietary battery ( many Fuji 's use AAs which are easy to find in a pinch ) , mandatory software to transfer fotos ( majority of digital cameras are recognized as an external device and behave just like an external drive for easy transfer ) , and the lack of a view finder which would overcome difficulty in seeing the LCD in bright conditions . The features that I really liked are many . Here 's a few worth mentioning . Remember , these are extremely rare in a pocket size camera . First are the super cool variety of shooting modes especially the " Natural & " which takes two shots in sequence , one with and one without flash ( really handy when pesky shadows are around ) . I also had never seen continuous shooting mode options in a small camera . That 's the best way to capture subjects that are ever changing like kids playing , animals , or sports . It also helps to be able to change resolution settings with several to choose from topping off with 6 megapixel . This is a decent starter-trainig camera that will teach a novice how to use many features that are common in more upscale cameras when it comes time to upgrade . Casual users who can tolerate photo quality comparable to disposable cameras will probably not notice any difference . So I would give it to a first time digital user who has limited camera experience . The features are fun to use - just don't expect award winning photos .  
1	  I faithfully used my prior Logitech Harmony 880 , and when it finally broke , I decided to upgrade to Logitechs 's flagship 1000 model ( which I have been using for several months ) . However , the new Harmony 1000 is so painful to use that I am seriously considering swallowing the $ 500 and buying another 880 ! I have had to dig out my original device remote controls , and once again have 3 different remotes littering the coffee table . My wife has given up , and completely refuse to use this thing anymore . Problems specific to the 1000 model : 1 . It uses ' beta ' software and crashes regularly . Adding salt to the wound , there is no reset switch , and you have to pry open a stubborn battery latch , remove and replace the battery , and then wait several minutes to reboot . 2 . The touch screen is cumbersome , it is not very customizable , and it is poorly laid out . The unintended result of streamlining this remote and removing the hard buttons is that it forces the user to navigate multiple menus just to get to the desired buttons . However , you cannot rearrange the screen to simply include you most frequently used commands , nor can you choose which set of buttons first pops up when you choose an activity . 3 . The touch screen forces you to actually look at the remote to find the buttons you want , like the guide or menu button . Also , the screen saver kicks in after a few minutes , and then forces you to first joggle the device to ' wake up ' so you can see the screen . 4 . The shape makes it very difficult to use with one hand ( and I have large but agile monkey hands ) . Those are my top complaints for the Harmony 1000 . I do still enjoy a good universal remote , but this is not the model to buy . Please note that it you happen do get a Logitech universal remote ( the 880 was fine ) , be prepared for a Lengthy set up process to get it correctly tweaked . It takes a long time for Logitech 's remotes to change settings , and tweaking your first remote for optimal efficiency can take an hour + .  
1	  i bought this item to extend my shooting range on my nikon d100 - the longest lens i have is a 300mm . the 2X converter didn't fit my nikkor 300mm , my tamron 28-80mm or my nikon 105 .  
1	  I bought this through Amazon from another retiler . It was an open box item so I cant return it . I have it connected to a very nice antenna but cant receive any signals at all . It makes white noise , but thats it . I checked inside the case to see if there were any loose connections , but didnt see any . Also , the channel selector is sloppy , it sometimes skips a channel , then you have to go back . The PA output is not very loud .  
2	  These earphones works Great . I got them for my MOM and the sound is more than enough loudness . It replaces one of my cheap Ipod immitation earphones that always kept dieing and falling apart . Sony Earphones are awesome and this one worked great for me . Its Just perfect on my Ipod Touch . Not to mention the Great Price . Thanks Sony For the Awesomeness  
2	  Used them for the first time for hunting season and they were very clear and fit the use I purchased them for . We went for range a test with putting them in different cars and going down the road . Basically they were good for about two and a half miles before the static took over . I think the Midland company tests these units at the top of some mountain with nothing between the other person " 26 miles " away . I would love to know how they come up with the rating " 26 Miles " ?  
1	  I consider this a total waste of money and space . I get stronger signals with the built in-antennas on the D-Link Xtreme Gigabit router than with this external antenna attached . I spent several hours trying every location and antenna angle I could , and no arrangement provided as good a signal as the built-in antennas . I packed it back up and threw it in the bottom of my closet .  
1	  I 've had two of these and each time the z-axis ( twist ) control fails . I 've read alot of negative reviews conserning the same . Two thumbs down for this product , I 'm extremely unhappy with it .  
2	  I have never written a review before on any product I have bought but these headphones deserve special attention . These are by far the nicest earphones I have ever owned . The sounds that these little speakers produce makes me wonder how can earphones get any better . Their noise cancelling properties are excellent and they fit in my ear like a dream . Only concerns I have with them are I don't see them lasting for a long amount of time . The chord from the earpieces are very thin and flimsy . Also I wouldn't suggest buying these unless whatever device you have has an equalizer but , as soon as you find that sweet spot you 'll never want to take them out of your ear . A 5 out of 5 is well deserved for these earphones .  
2	  I recently ordered 2 memory sticks for an old PC that I was using as a test server . The memory , not only , came within the expected delivery date , but well before . The product took 15 minutes to install and has worked like a champ ever since .  
1	  When new it worked good , but after a short time it lost its mind , and would not play anything and started eating tapes . Too bad who ever makes Sylvania now doesn't have the quality they used to be known for .  
2	  Works as advertised with 1080p HDMI 1.3 . Can't see any reason to pay premium price for Monster , etc . Worked perfectly on first attempt interconnecting Panasonic THPZ700U 1080p plazma TV , Onkyo TX-SR605 receiver , Panasonic DMP-BD10AK Blue Ray and Motorola DCH3416 ( Comcast ) DVR / cable box .  
1	  I purchased this system for my father , as a father 's day gift . It arrived [ .. ] in a timely fashion , as always , but then I waited and waited and waited for DirecTV to get in touch with me for installation ( as indicated in the information provided on this page . ) When I finally got tired of waiting , I called them , figuring it was some sort of glitch . What I got was a rude , arrogant , don't know nothing don't want to know nothing attitude from the customer service person I spoke to who assured me that they did NOT provide installation . That was something I had to get from the place that sold it to me . And no matter how many times I tried to explain , the response was always , " No , you have to contact the place where you bought it . This isn't our problem . " Well I did contact the place where I bought it to tell them to take it back because I was not about to take this any further . And to Amazon 's eternal credit , they took it back , no questions asked , and apologized for the problem . In my opinion , they had nothing to apologize for ; they did what they were supposed to do . It 's DirecTV that fell down on the job . So ask yourself ( as I did ) do you want to be tied to a company that has such a loose definition of service ? The prospect of months or even years - assuming they ever bothered to hook up the system ; I have a friend who is still waiting nearly 10 months after recieving a system as a Christmas gift - of trying to get them to respond in case of problems , was just daunting . So I called DISH , they hooked up a system within 3 days and have always been polite and helpful when there have been problems or requests on this end . HUGE difference , and one I recommend you take into account before you commit to something like this .  
2	  Case Logic design it 's just for the use of protection . Passports external drives fit tightly and without problem . In order to secure more and have your drive without scratches , i personal recommend to buy a Drawstring Carrier for My Passport Essential Drives ( Model : WDCC03XMS ) directly in the WD USA Store for just $ 4.99 and you get the perfect and elegant protection .  
1	  Oh how this thing sucks let me count the ways . # 1 On alot of my DVD 's the audio would get out of sync from the video . This would happen with store bought DVD 's very very annoying . # 2 . Half the time it would take a minute or more to read a DVD . # 3 . Most of the time a DVD would freeze during play . # 4 and the worst part about this thing is after a few months of light use it wont load a DVD anymore , when I looked up the problem online its most likely that the laser assembly is broken , so prety much money down the drain . Avoid buying this thing . I have learned the hard way that its cheap price tag comes from cheap parts that break in a few months .  
2	  I love this touch lamp . It is much more modern and asthetically pleasing than the old brass touch lamps . This lamp has 3 brightness settings which come in handy in our nursery .  
1	  I read other reviews that complained about the gel product oozing out the seams . Fortunately that has not happened to me , but within a couple weeks the product permanently dented ( severely ) in the center where my wrist falls . That part of the pad is almost rock hard now . It is like using a book or other hard surface for your wrist . I would not buy this product again .  
1	  Received Firelite portable as a gift and while it worked on my Mac G5 desktop it didn't work on either a Toshiba notebook or Apple Powerbook . This has to be more then a coincedence since a similar drive by CMS works perfectly on all three machines without the need for an adaptor . The support offered by the Smartdisk site did not resolve the problem .  
2	  Had to order while in the UK for delivery in Florida and the whole process was excellent throughout . 5 Stars *  
2	  Best FM transmitter I have had . To bad the FCC has required the newer versions to be weaker in signal strength .  
1	  This device lasted less than a year . I plugged in and it worked fine at first , then all of a sudden started having problems . Couldn't tell if it was the USB port in the PC or the hub / reader until THE JACK ON THE BACK OF THE UNIT SNAPPED AND FELL INTO THE HUB ! I would recommend you stay away from this brand . And yes , the stand was useless .  
2	  I installed this modem to avoid having a phone line connected directly to a stand-alone control system . The setup was quick and the modem has worked flawlessly through several hundred calls and a significant lightning storm .  
1	  I had one of the first home Wi-Fi systems using an Intel 802.11b access point that cost about $ 1000 . ( Yup , this is how much they cost for early adopters . Of course , it was worth every penny as Wi-Fi changes your life . ) The Intel access point was incredibly difficult to configure , requiring several calls to tech support , but the range was excellent and the unit functioned continously until it finally died after a couple of years . I decided to replace the Intel access point with the Netgear FM114P , assuming it was at the top of the Netgear line and I thought Netgear was a reliable manufacturer . How wrong I was . This unit is simply unacceptable . It will stop working every day or two for no apparent reason and require rebooting . Obviously , this is an irritation if you happen to be in another part of the house . Also , I have the impression that the range isn't as good as my previous Intel unit since I have more dead zones in my house . ( The Intel access point had two antennas - I don't know if this is significant . ) Overall , I am really disappointed . I suggest you stay away from Netgear until they improve their engineering .  
1	  I was very dissapointed with this mouse . First of all , it didn't work with any of the Dell 's in my house . The Dell 's in my house include , a Dell Dimension 4400 , a Dimension 8200 , and an Optiplex . After trying on these three computers , I tried it on my IBM Netvista . It worked on this computer . But worked isn't the best word . On the computer , the mouse didn't keep up with my movements , and I was moving my hand at a normal speed . This product gets one star , because I can't go any lower . I don't understand why they would make a product that wouldn't work with a Dell . If you want to buy a nice optical mouse , go with a microsoft mouse .  
1	  I have purchased and returned two sets of these headphones . The first set overheated and fried itself as soon as the batteries were installed . The second set worked for a little over an hour before developing constant hissing and popping . Also the head band adjuster would not retract on one side , making it impossible to fold them up for storage in the travel bag . I consider the quality of this headset one of the poorest I have ever seen . Even frayed bare wires were visible on one side . I recommend you avoid Taurus products completely .  
1	  While I 've been a devoted Logitech mouse user for seven years , this mouse leaves a lot to be desired . I was looking for a high-quality mouse that would work nicely with my XP notebook and SeaMonkey . I was quite disappointed . Physically , the mouse is nicely made , but it 's awfully big for a " notebook " mouse . It 's only a half-inch smaller than my desktop mouse . The switches are nicely clicky , and the scroll wheel is very solid and spins quite well in both modes . The only mechanically downside is the zoom slider , which has a very stiff spring making it hard to use . The form factor is also pretty good with two caveats : first , the search button behind the wheel is a stretch to reach . The only way I found to click it without lifting my hand off of the mouse was to lift the tip of my middle finger up and push the button with the base of my finger . That 's an awkward move . Also , the thumb buttons are too high to be easily reached . The old design , with the thumb button near the desktop , was much better . The killer with this mouse , however , is the drivers . They are buggy , half-featured , and generally unusable . Both SetPoint v3.1 on the CD and the latest v4.0 from the Logitech website required third-party extensions to the configuration files to enable the use of a thumb button as the middle button . Also , many of the features , such as zoom , web forward , and web back , require the driver to recognize the current application . SetPoint is very erratic to doing this . Sometimes it works , sometimes it doesn't , and no amount of restarting the SetPoint software seems to make any difference . The search functionality , while nice in principle , is also crippled . Most of the search engine / web browser combinations simply don't work . Yahoo ! Live Words seems to work with all browsers , and Microsoft IE seems to work with all search engines . However , use a non-Microsoft browser with any search engine other than Yahoo ! Live Words , and you 're dead in the water . After fooling around with this for four days trying to get the drivers to behave , I returned it . It 's probably fine if you want to use it exactly as configured by default with IE and Logitech 's preferred search engine , Yahoo ! , but anyone who needs a functioning middle button and prefers Google / Firefox / SeaMonkey is simply out of luck .  
2	  If you wish to have longer battery life & want your camera to look more professional - this is the way to go . It 's a convenitent way to carry two batteries . Super handy when shooting vertical shots . Only bad things .. it 's a piece of plastic & is no way near in build of the D200 . Still I like it a lot . My next camera ( ordered the D300 ) will immediately , when available , have a grip - cause that grip is built much sturdier & will allow for 8 fps with stronger batteries . I really find myslef enjoying having a grip for my D200 & from now on will probably always get them .  
2	  Great way to transfer images and is really easy and fast . No cords no mess , highly recomend with any digital camera !  
2	  I ordered this for my Epson PictureMate printer without reading the description very carefully and thought I was only paying for paper . How great to open up the package and see an ink cartridge , too ! With the super-low price on this pack , it is officially cheaper to print your own digital pictures than to take them to a store to have it done ( especially when you figure in the high price of gas to get there ) . The ink has never smudged and lasts through all 100 pieces of photo paper . The paper is very high quality , and pictures printed on it look like traditionally developed photos .  
2	  I am so happy ! I have tried a couple of Bluetooth adapters that did not work on my Vista 64 laptop . In fact the Rockfish micro adapter crashed my system and I had to restore Windows . I did a lot of research , mostly here on Amazon and found the IOGEAR GBU221 Bluetooth to USB adapter which claimed to work with Vista 64 . I followed the directions explicitly , but a problem arose right away . The first instruction was to insert the adapter in the USB slot . As soon as I did , Windows automatically started installing drivers . I had no options . Once the drivers and software were installed , I could see the Bluetooth adapter in device manager . I could also pair my Rocketfish Bluetooth headphones with the computer , but could not use them to listen to playback . I tried running the CD that came with the adapter and it exited immediately with the message that a later driver was already installed . I uninstalled the software and tried it again . Same problem . I called IOGEAR and they suggested I download the drivers from their web site , which I did . After installing them , the headset still wouldn't connect , though it would pair . I did have a new option on the right click menu for the headphones that was labeled " control " . I tried that and after looking around , I found that my headphones had the option checked which indicated that they had a display screen so I could type in a passkey . My headphones have no such display . I checked the other box that said " no display " and closed the program . I had to re-pair the headphones one more time and then EUREKA ! They worked ! One other note , the headphones had a " pop " every so many seconds . I went into the right click menu on the headphones and turned off everything except Audio , and remote control . Now the pop is gone and the signal is excellent . I can listen to the music playing on my laptop , anywhere in the house with no problems . Very nice . The headphone now connect instantly when turned on . One of the suggestions in the Windows trouble shooting guide indicated that a Bluetooth adapter might need more amps than those normally provided by a hub . This one runs fine without the hub being plugged into an A / C outlet .  
1	  I never owned an iPod , so since Zune hit the market I 'd thought I 'd check it out . Went to my local retailer and was able to do some hands on comparing the iPod and Zune . The iPod had a much better feel and was lighter . The sound qualty was the same ( using the same set of head phones for each ) . The scrolling was easier on the iPod . The Zune is larger than the iPod , the iPod felt right in my hand . The video screen on the Zune was a little larger but the clarity seem to pale next to the iPods . Now as far as software installation , I don't know . but when I walked out of the store , an iPod came home with me . The iPod software installed quickly , works smoothly with iTunes . I am so glad I compare first ! I say get an iPod !  
1	  i have a garmin quest fitted to my bike but recently had the chance to use a tomtom rider for a few days . they do not compare . considering the rider is twice the price , it is no more glove friendly than the quest , and the bluetooth feature is a complete pain . why no simple headphone socket ? the directions were difficult to hear on the motorway , full volume is only about a quarter that of the garmin . with helmet speakers ( of your choice ) the quest gives simple to hear directions , in stereo . the quest comes with full european mapping , for no extra . i will not be rushing to buy one and do not reccommend it as particularly " motorcycle friendly " , obviously no bikers were involved in the development !  
1	  The only good thing about the Nady PMC-3X was the velcro to attach the speakers to the helmet . The rest stinks ! Poor sound , poor FM radio , cheap connections and no communication above 40 mph . But at least I know what not to buy again .  
1	  I paid what I thought was a premium price for premium speakers which sound like cheasy 1950s paper spekers . No bass , buzzes , no dynamic range , etc . , etc . etc . These speaker are all ads , ads , ads . No delivery at all . I have them hooked up to a good Denon 200 Watt receiver , and zip performance . Nada . They sound a thousand times worse than the rotted out 20-year-old Radio Shack speakers they replace . Bose is all puff and guff ! No wonder they dont sell in regular audio stores ; no one will handle this junk ! Garbage ! I was ripped off ! I am going back to Radio Shack . At least I dont feel bad paying nothing for junk then . And their junk is at least priced right . Jim Isham , Penfield , NY . God , this pisses me off . Bose can go jump in the lake and take their overhyped overpriced speakers with them ; tied to their feet !  
2	  Excellent product and delivery . Given as a gift , so no first hand details , but the recipient loves it .  
1	  I received a defective piece . So it didn't work at all . But regardless of that , I could just feel the cheap plastic material that its made off . It wouldn't have lasted much anyway . Returning it to the vendor .  
1	  I bought two of these for Christmas ' 03 . Both stop working when you take them outside in the winter . You get a high pitched screech and they die . I have another problem with one and have been trying to send it back for repair since August 3rd it is now Aug 24th . Weeks of e-mails and phone calls and I finally get two numbers to call and fax . I do this and find both have been disconnected . Finally today I get another e-mail saying you 'd be better off buying a new one since it is out of warranty . My feeling is they have no service capability . I would never buy another product from this company .  
1	  I bought this product primarily because I wanted a FAX / TAD that had a cordless phone . I needed to replace my Panasonic and the store that I went to did not have a Panasonic in stock . The only fax that also had a cordless phone feature was the Brother All-in-One so I decided to give it a try . It was the worst purchase I have made in a very long time . Having an extra printer / copier around was just a bonus to me and in fact it is the only part of the machine that is not a disappointment . The restrictions on how the TAD can be used make it complicated and ineffective . Callers who leave a message have limited time to do so and that cannot be adjusted . I have had numerous clients have their messages cut off and I think that they find it insulting . When monitoring calls I have to listen to the outgoing message each time . Also during monitoring : if the caller hangs up we have to listen to a dial tone blaring in the room for several minutes . It 's very distracting . If you are in the middle of a project and do not to stop to pick up the phone you will wish you had when you hear this racket . As an added annoyance : If the caller hangs up right away you have to hear the outgoing message on top of the dial tone ( both at the same time ) . It 's hard to imagine why Brother thought that was a good feature . The outgoing message is limited to 20 seconds for the message center to work properly . I have confirmed with customer service that there also must be a delay of 5 seconds before our outgoing message starts . I have had clients who when confronted the with the five seconds of silence when they first called have assumed that they misdialed and hung up before the message came on . It even happened to me the first time I called my number after installing the Brother MFC-845CW .. Picking up calls from a remote phone is cumbersome enough that we just do not do it . If you are used to calling your phone and typing in your three or four digit code you will not be pleased with this system . I finally gave up and spent a $ 114 on another answering machine thinking I could just use the Brother for faxing and copying . I was then told that I cannot bypass the TAD on the Brother but still receive faxes without a number of new restrictions : My new TAD needs to be set to pick up on two rings if the Brother is to work as a fax machine . I am not interested in trying to run to pick up each call within two rings in order to avoid having the answering machine pick up . There is one possible way to get around this : having distinctive ring for faxes . Unfortunately that is not available though my local phone company ( I am located in the Virgin Islands ) . I am not alone in hating this device . The two other people working in our small office also find it intolerable . Having purchased the Brother All-in-One , and an auxiliary answering device I am still without what I needed in the first place : a TAD / FAX with a cordless fax . As for the the great customer service : we did not find them exemplary . The three people we spoke to did speak English ( not as a first language but well enough that we were not frustrated ) but we did get conflicting information . I guess it is hard to be a great customer service representative for a really bad product . After a month of frustration I am going to discard it unless I can find someone to give it to that just wants a copier . I 'll get the Panasonic that I originally wanted . I hope I can save someone else from this product .  
1	  The package I received is totally different than the picture shown on this page and when I tried using the battery it was already dead . Guess that 's why they are selling it for so cheap with free shipping . You get what you pay for !  
2	  not much to be said , they 're a great value , CMPLE has really impressed me with their wire , and now these ! white barrels are easy to sharpie to whatever color you want , they 're cheap and the plastic doesnt like to crack . should last a long time . if you 're looking for RCA keystones , get these . I shopped around a long time on here , with free shipping these are the best deal at about $ 1,20 / per .  
1	  My title says it all . This light , at least the one I received is very bright , will definitely light up your case in an Ultra Violet bluish color , but will not act as a black light . I may have been shipped the wrong item , because some of the other reviewers were very satisfied with the black light effects , but mentioned it was " Dim " . The reason I suspect I was sent the wrong item is , I ordered another " UV " CCL from another source and it works as a black light just fine . It high lights everything in case that is UV reactive , but is Dim as described by reviewers here . The item that worked was from " Sidewinder Computers " . The one that doesn't was from " Amamax " . Another note , the one from " Amamax " was ordered Jan 21st and got lost or not shipped . They shipped a replacement that arrived Feb 9th . Long story short , not satisfied . Won't take chance on Amamax again . Chapter ll : ( MSG to Amamax ) : Hi , I finally received this order after your second attempt , but soon after plugging it in I found one of the tubes is starting to fail , it had wavy lines running thru it . also , this CCL is not what I ordered . It provides a bright " violet " color but doesn't act as blacklight . I ordered another " UV " CCL from another source and it works as a blacklight just fine , It highlights everything in case that is UV reactive , but is Dim ( like a blacklight should be ) . I wanted to return this but discovered since it wasn't sold and shipped by Amazon that I have to pay return postage . Not worth paying $ 3 + return shipping on a $ 6 item ! I learned a lesson here ! Regards , twin4az  
2	  The product I received was exactly as advertised online . The package also shipped quickly and arrived before I expected it .  
2	  These cards are worth it if you can get them under the retail price to save a bit of cash and so you don't have to use your Credit Card on Xbox live .  
1	  I just returned from a repeat air trip to England , and was hoping for a more restful ( read that more sleep with fewer distractions from crying children and the coughing lady in the next seat ) trip through the use of these Philips headphones . I found that the noise cancelling feature did decrease the droning ambient sounds to a somewhat helpful extent . Other cabin sounds were still intrusive . The sound quality did not seem much better than the airline-supplied headset and the product seems to be quite cheaply made . My biggest concerns were : 1 ) That the headphone pads had to be positioned carefully to derive any benefit from the noise canceling feature , which meant that I had to keep my head straight to not push on the neckband . Also , my neck pillow tended to push on the neckband and degrade performance . Bother . 2 ) My ( admittedly generous ) auricles just plain hurt after a few hours of use , and I had to take the headset off . I did buy a pair of noise-cancelling earbuds to address these two issues , and this approach has worked well . For instance , consider one of the Sure earbuds .  
1	  I purchased this item after carefully reading all the other reviews . I , like others , cound not get it to work with wireless security turned on . I even tired using the " tricks " described in another review . To be fair , the product worked fine without wireless security , but I see little point in helping my neighbors tap my internet connection . I am very disappointed in the product .  
2	  You get what you pay for when you buy the Palm m100 . Although it doesn't have any fancy features , it has all the basic needs you would want from an electric organizer . The m100 is overall easy to use , and very practical . It is small , so can fit easily into your purse or glove compartment . The biggest problem that I have with it is the weak flip cover , which I prefer to keep off . The Palm m100 also has some fun features . You can choose the font and alarm sound . There are also a variety of face plates so you don't always have to have the same boring black . This palm pilot is a great , affordable gadget for the hi-tech type person . The graffitti if easy to learn , the phonebook is easy to use , and there are also some great games . I would say that the palm m100 is a great buy !  
2	  This is not one of the best - this is THE VERY BEST shower radio I ever used . Easy to setup and operate , it has crystal-clear reception ( very close to modern high-definition radio ) .  
1	  I 've had this thing for 4.5 years . After the first few months it died , trapping all the CD 's , which Sony " lost " . It made the clunking sound and would power off by itself . Sent it to SONY who " repaired " it and sent it back . When it came back it had another problem ( which I can't remember now . ) So I sent it back and repeated the process . 4 years later , the clunking sound / power down problem started again . Of course , no more warranty . Our last Sony system lasted at least 10 years ; we gave it away when we got this one . If you 're looking to buy a used one of these , don't .  
1	  I bought this camera as a Christmas gift for my husband . Luckily I ordered early because I had to return it twice . The first time it worked for a few days before experiencing an internal error - it flashed an error code repeatedly and with no explanation in the user 's manual what the code meant , I had to call technical support . I was advised to return it to Amazon , and did . Although they were helpful , the replacement was backordered for over a month . When it finally arrived , it was defective right out of the box ! I finally exchanged it at a local store . Now that I have one that works , I am relatively pleased with it ( although the software locks up occasionally ) but don't think the camera was worth all that effort . If you choose this one , brace yourself for a hassle before finally getting it to work .  
2	  I use this gps holder on my mountain bike and it supports very well all kind of abuse , hits on the ground , vibrations , etc . Very well made product with a strong plastic and a hard fix to the bike .  
2	  I used this product to replace troublesome RF-based wireless connection between my cable modem in my office and my wife 's computer in the kitchen . The RF connection was spotty , weak , and undependable , despite trying various brands and configurations of RF routers . The Netgear 104G was simple , and produced an uninterrupted , steady , strong , and fast internet connection . Yay !  
2	  This is a fast router with a very reliable connection . Don't miss this one ! It 's the deal of a lifetime ! I love it !  
2	  Before you buy this Loupe you should look carefully at the dimensions . It is small ~ 1 " base X 1-2 cm eye piece . But I used it to differentiate the colors of sand grains ranging from 0.15-0.4mm diameters . It was really helpful and cheap for the amount of magnification . I found a bigger 12X stand magnifier elsewhere but it was >$ 60 . This is the most magnification I found for the buck .  
1	  The only thing that takes a trip is the ITRIP.I have bought 3 , 2 for friends and one for me . Mine I have returned once for a replacent and now thereplacement doesn't work . One of my friend 's ITRIP alsostopped working .  
1	  This card has a known issue with many motherboards . When i purchased this product I had an msi k7n2 motherboard . this card installed fine but upon restart " found new hardware " icon popped up . I thought somehthing was wrong with my motherboard . So i went out and bought a new motherboard and processor . this time an msi k8n neo2 but to no avail . This card still does the same thing . If you doubt me go and check creative support site . There are hundereds of people out there with the same problem . DO NOT BUY .  
1	  i managed to connect this " adapter " to my 3 1/2 " drive , but when i went to place the expanded drive into my 5 1/4 " bay , it was about 1/4 " shy . maybe it would work with some other bay , but not mine . useless .  
1	  To start with I had to buy a blu ray player because the movie we just " HAD " to see is only out in blu Ray . Thank you Sony Entertainment ! Brought it home plugged it in and the disc player works fine . I selected this model as it connects to Netflix , Internet TV , and a music subscription service . For all of this the price of $ 110 seemed pretty reasonable as we already subscribe to Netflix anyway . We have a wireless router in the home office that connects everyone to the Internet . I also have a ROKU set up in the living room that connects to the big screen TV . Unfortunately the ROKU apparently drags down our broadband speed when some of us want to watch a movie and others want to play video games online . Therefore , the ROKU ends up " mysteriously " disconnected when the video games start to lag . It quickly became obvious that I had two choices for connecting the blu ray player to the Internet . I could string a cat five ethernet cable from the office to the television , a distance of 35 feet or so , or , I could run out and buy a Samsung wireless LAN adapter for another 60 bucks depending on where I buy it . I just wanted everyone to know that this unit is not Wi-Fi ready ( and doesn't claim to be ) nor user-friendly and that Samsung has successfully hidden another $ 60 charge to get their product to work as advertised . If your router is right next to your TV set you shouldn't have a problem with this , all you have to do is buy another cat five cable . But not all of us have a router conveniently located within 3 feet of our television . In which case be prepared to pony up another 60 bucks and / or a trip to Fry 's electronics , or get online with Amazon . com to buy a wireless LAN adapter . They could have told you all this on the box but that wouldn't sell a lot of units now would it ! ? I 'm not impressed .  
2	  I got this for my son 's computer ; he had a fairly old wireless adapter prior to this one . He was having a big problem with lag when he played WOW or some other on-line games . This adapter fixed those problems . Plus installation is a snap . It didn't get a five rating because I don't care much for the Linksys software . It takes over from the Windows Configuration settings for the wireless adapters but it seems to lose it 's settings a bit . So , after installation , switch back to the Windows wireless configurations and thinks work well .  
1	  I bought these a few months ago . For some reason , only one works right , the other one sounds like the voice coil is blown . What a piece of crap . I 'm only running 150 watts to the speakers as well .  
2	  I just love my iPod . It has so many options and add ons that allow me to play my music no matter where I go . I have it playing all the time . The only problem is it 's SO small that I would suggest you buy a protective case of some kind . The iPod is so delicate that I don't think it would take much to break it . I bought the Rhino clear / aluminum case and it 's great . It 's my best gadget to date .  
2	  Product was delivered on time and no issues with the cable , it is working fine  
2	  I have been a long time video camera user , and this is my first time moving away from using tapes . I could not be happier . No more worring about what tape is in the camera , if it at the right spot . Just pick it up and go . The 7 hours on the best quality it plenty of time and the download to the computer is easy . I love the touch screen controls as well . So far no problems . I did think that the download to the computer would be faster .. could just be my computer because I don't have a USB 2.0 connection , just regular USB . Still , way faster than having to play it in real time , and you don't lose quality .  
1	  I was forced to give this product a star to post my comments . I work in the Professional Audio Industry and my company actually sells a good quanity of Denon-Marantz Professional products , and we have always felt that their product gives good value for the money . After seeing this item from their sister consumer division I have to say I think we may have to reconsider our use of Denon 's product . I have to ask do they have this product leftover from some government contract with NASA or DOD ? Those are the only people I can think of that would be silly enough to buy this item . Can anybody say $ 500.00 hammer ?  
2	  It does exactly what it says it does ( thus 5 stars ) but IMO get a Nano instead as it 's only slightly more expensive , has many more features yet still gives you the same shuffle feature . This is a great answer for your parents or grandparents though who want to listen to music while they take their morning jog or walk though because it really is easy to use .  
1	  I liked the mp1000 until I upgraded to Windows XP , and was astonished to discover that the company will not support it . The device is now worth scrap metal . Customer Support responded with a form letter to the effect that they feel my pain , but drop dead anyway . Philip Christopher , the CEO , did not respond to my letter at all - probably too busy making deals to bother with solidifying his customer base . Don't waste your hard-earned money on Audiovox products .  
2	  Not much else to say .. It 's a cable , it 's cat6 , it was the advertised CTG snagless design , and it was shipped very quickly from Amazon .  
1	  I read about the memory leak and thought I 'd buy it anyway since it seems easy to use and setup according to the other reviews . And besides , that was a long time ago and since a memory leak is the worst kind of bug in the world , surely they would have fixed it by now , right ? WRONG ! The file WUSB54Gv42 . EXE seems to be allocating a few K of memory everytime it gets a packet , and grows to over 500 MB in a few days . Users who don't have this problem must be rebooting every day . If you hibernate your computer at night as I do you 'll eventually use up all your virtual memory . One workaround is to use task manager to kill the file WUSB54Gv42 . EXE every couple of days - it comes right back to life with only a small working set of a few MB . The gentleman who first posted the review about the memory leak also gave a better workaround , i.e. , uninstall Linsys 's wireless utility , then install the driver off the CD and use the OS wireless manager . One minor thing that I don't like about it is that the velcro sticky strip eventually gets tired and drops off if you hang it on a verticle surface . In any case , only buy this if you reboot every couple of days or are willing to use one of the workarounds .  
1	  I bought the sd800 also , and have white spots on 50 % of the pictures I take indoors with flash .. I got my lenses cleaned by a tech and still the same problem .. It looks like it documents the dust in the air .. so if you have a very dusting place .. youll have more of these white spots .. I take pictures of dancers .. so theres more dust sweept of the floor .. this is my theory Im not too sure yet .. but whats really frustrating is that I paid 500 $ for it and I had better results with a disposable cam ! Im still in talks with the shop owner cause Im really not happy with this product ! ONe thing is for shure is that I dont think its normal to pay that much and then having to deal with spots on pictures .  
2	  This was a nice way to shop for people like myself that live in rural areas , no surprises . Thanks !  
2	  Loved the ease of setup and to select an empty channel . I 've setup this channel to be # 2 on my car 's FM . It 's easy , phone rings , push # 2 on radio and push answer on the unit . I 'm hearing impaired , so having the car speakers giving me the volume I need is a great feature . I LOVE IT .  
1	  I have also experienced the noise and very slow speed others have mentioned . Additionally , the product has prematurely failed . Turning off PCast did silence the clicking noise , but this forced me to use another drive for my shared iTunes library . To its credit , the drive was able to stream HDTV ( a recorded transport stream of about 10GB per hour ) , but for general file copying , this drive is very , very s l o w . My main complaint with this product is the fact that it completely FAILED less than 2 years after purchase . I had thought I was extending the life of the product by turning off PCast ( constant read / write ) but to no avail . The LED now blinks 6 times , indicating irreparable disk failure , emits a painful groaning noise , and will not connect to any computer . I have also experienced the same , slow , nearly useless advice from the customer " service " personnel . Forget about ever reaching them by phone - their M.O. is a delayed , cryptic e-mail if anything at all . I will never buy another Buffalo product . I bought this product because technically it looked good on paper - in spite of its ugly enclosure design . But while the company may have some good ideas , their execution is pitiful .  
1	  I bought this merely to print black and white tax forms . It did that fine , although the ink cartridge got used up very quickly just printing the test pages everytime the machine got powered on . Nobody was able to tell me how stop this behavior . The real problem arouse when I had to restore my machine . The restore point did not have the HP all in one software loaded . The printer would not work as the software would not download again after the restore . HP support in India gave me dozens of things to try in various order , none of which worked . The printer is now junk because it cannot plug and play or download the software . The machine is like new , but will not work after the restore . I won't ever buy an HP printer again after this experience .  
2	  I fell on some ice and unfortunately my camera was in the case on my shoulder . I fell backwards and the lens end of the case hit the ground . The UV filter took the impact and saved a $ 200 lens ! All I had to do was unscrew it and put a new one on . It also keeps dust and fingerprints off the lens and does not negatively affect the photos I take . I will be buying another one , hands down a necessity !  
1	  I purchased this TV in August 2006 , and it quit working around March 2008 . ( less than 15 months ! ) Apparently Olevia utilizes the substandard Darfon V144 back light inverter board . When the board goes , so does the TV . Of course you can purchase a new board online for about $ 200 . But why invest that amount , when you can add another $ 200 , and purchase a new and better TV.I 'm really disappointed with the Olevia brand . I guess that 's why you see so many of them for sale online . And their either refurbished or open box . I 'm sure a lot of customers are returning Olevias due to their unreliability . Do yourself a favor and buy a Panasonic , Sharp , Sony , Samsung or RCA product . Trust me ; being cheap in the beginning , is really not worth it in the end . I learned the hard way .  
2	  I used to have Three Lacie drives as my backup ( two FW400 drives , one USB2 drive ) . After having the two FW400 drives die on me while they were still under warranty ( and the company would not repair or replace my failing drives ) , I knew I needed to try another brand . After hearing from a roommate that the external hard drive she 's carried around in her backpack was a G-Tech , I decided to give them a chance . 2 G-Tech drives later , I 'm a convert . I ended up getting this particular model as a gift last year . So far , I 've had no problems with it . They never overheat , are fast , super quiet , and easy to daisy chain ( even if it 's to a different model G-Tech ) . The best part about them is I never have to install software on my macs like I had to do with my Maxtor Drive ! They run just as well on my MacBook Pro as they do when hooked up to my iMac . The only con is all the cords .  
1	  This is nothing more than a very small piece of cotton cloth that is over-priced . The size and usefulness is such that I would only expect to see these as give-aways at a trade show or something . What a joke - there are much better values to be found on Amazon such as the Nikon Micro Fiber cleaning cloth that fits into its ' own pouch . I wish I had found it before I purchased this piece of worthless scrap .  
2	  Bought it at a retail store . It is essential that it is set at a " clear " channel that is neither occupied or has interference from other channels . Mine is set to 88.7 , I can stand nearly 40 feet away from the radio and still no change in sound . What I did notice is that the quality of the receiver is also critical , they do not all tune in the same , some receivers will " catch " the channel better without even a hiss . Stereo seperation is also a factor . It is easy to setup and reconnect , no external power , no cords , many channels , and very affordable !  
2	  perfect for what I needed - easy to install - price was right - could not find in local stores - thanks for your help  
2	  It 's a cable . If you plug it in and it works , what else can you say or expect . This one was not broken and it did what I expected it to do . It arrived when it was supposed to and I would have no problem recommending this item to anyone interested in such a purchase .  
2	  Excellent device .. I use it to remote view my security camera 's about 140-150 feet .. It is connected to the PC port of a regular 32in flat screen TV . The colors are not exactly like the direct connected monitor but it is what I expected for a VGA video signal . Highly recommended ..  
2	  These earbuds aren't bad at all and really nice for average buds and for the price . I bought em couple years ago and I still use them .. because they still work unlike some other ones . Straight 2.0 jacks never works for me cause they always get damages the way I use them but this has L shaped jack and it works perfect for me and the joints and the wire itself is very flexible so they don't break down easily . Only thing I personally didn't like was the the length difference .  
1	  The software will not install on my Dell Precision 450 workstation so all of the extra keys are unavailable . I am unimpressed with the keyboard but , I am sure , I will eventually learn to deal with it . What is the greater disapointment is the mouse ; quite honestly I could aim a flashlight easier . The pointer is sloppy and inacurate and after using the mouse for a few hours there are times when the right button quits respondinding . If I put the USB dongle in a slot on the back of the computer , the keyboard and mouse quit responding , so I 'm stuck with the dongle up front . I am using the mouse keyboard to write this review and the mouse is absolutely frustrating at how inacurate it is . And to add insult to injury , Amazon dropped the price within hours of purchase .  
1	  I really liked this product when I first received it , especially for the price . The outside material durable but the case does not seal closed , which could lead to dirt and debris getting onto the usb drives if thrown in your bag . As such , I kept this hooked to the key ring within my Swiss Gear backpack and used it gently . This morning I was upset to find that there is a spot near the opening lever that was weak and broke , rendering the clip useless .  
2	  I unhooked my previous D-Link product ( which was so old they didn't support it anymore ) and hooked up this one . After the bried installation process , everything worked perfectly . It seems to be considerably faster but it 's somewhat difficult to quantify . My ROKU works perfectly w / o any hesitation and all my other nodes seem to operate well . I don't believe I see any further range but again , it 's difficult to tell . So far so good ; my son won't be able to try out the live gaming until he comes home from college . I 'd expect this will be the most demanding application .  
2	  This is a good deal at the low Amazon price . The only problem I had was the USB cable that came with the unit was defective . I used another spare cable and it worked fine . The remote is a little cheesy , but it does work . Some of the buttons have a weird symbol that takes some experimenting to figure out . Soo , overall this is well worth the price . It was compatible with my G5 60 Gb video iPod .  
2	  Exactly what I needed and at the right price . Was shipped and arrived much sooner than I anticipated .  
1	  I 'm on my 3rd unit , returned to sams club twice , and will return the 3rd unit today - it is absolutely horrible . Skipping is an issue of when , not if . After a few weeks , the slightest of road bump will make your disk go to the beginning . Irritation and rowdy kids ensue ..  
2	  Product came and works great ! It was exactly what the picture showed . I am satisfied with this order . Thank you  
1	  I loved this router until I discovered its limitation . Firmware version 1.38 does not allow MSN voice and file transfer . Upgrading it to version 1.39 which addresses that problem seems to be impossible . I had to buy another one for that purpose . So far MSN voice and file transfer work only when I fully open the firewall through DMZ . Port Forwarding does not do the job and Linksys support seems to be giving up on that issue . . . However , everything else works fine for my needs  
1	  WARNING : If you need to run a usb cable over 15 ' , I 'd recommend to NOT purchase a standard cable like this . I used this cable to connect to a remote powered hub , and had nothing but continuous problems with all my USB devices , which even interfered with my Vista OS such that the PC wouldn't even boot up until I disconnected all the USB peripherals , presumably due to signal loss over that distance . All my USB peripherals performed erraticaly with this cable . The product should include this warning . So , I have just purchased a USB Active Extension Booster cable which I hope will resolve the problem of signal attenuation . The cable may be adequate for a single remote USB device like a printer , but you 'd be safer to get the booster cable to avoid the hassle .  
1	  I purchased these hoping to upgrade my powerline network , which uses the older Netgear XE102 . Using XE102s , I get about 500 Kilobits / sec - way too slow . So , I anxiously plugged in my HDX101 's , hoping to get at least 10-20 Megabits / sec . Instead , I get about 600 Kilobits / sec . :( Perhaps it 's a problem unique to my electrical wiring , but .. needless to say , I was very disappointed .  
2	  Originally I wanted a DV model camcorder but I couldn't find one that I really liked that was under $ 1000 . I had looked at the Sony Digital 8 format and thought it was a great idea so I bought this model . I has the features I wanted ; DV firewire in / out , S-video in / out , rca a / v in / out , it 's stereo , and has a built in 2.5 " lcd monitor . The separation on the stereo audio is quite good considering how the left / right mic pickups are in the same chasis . I have yet to hear scanner motor noise in the audio either and it has an external stereo mic input if you want to get a higher quality mic . I used it on an overcast day in the country to get some footage of the dark clouds and the audio was beautiful . The tapes I 've tried using are regular 8mm tapes and it came with a Hi-8 tape and to be honest I have yet to see a difference in the video quality ( although years from now there may be more dropouts ) . If you want manual white balance , you 'll have to pay more , but for what this camcorder cost 's , it 's amazing . Highly recommended !  
1	  Hey , I just want to let people know about this headset . I haven't used it , but I have Used the KOSS earbuds that are the same version . The idea is that these foamies at the tip of the earbuds are supposed to squish into your ear and provide " sound-insolation , " but in reality , it is almost hard to get them into your ears in the first place . the foam is much softer than your average faom ear-plug , so if you roll it into a tube to get it into your ear , it only stays rolled up / squished for a fraction of a second . by the time you get it into your ear , it has expanded and simply squishes laterally on the surface of your ears . If you do happen to get it in , they easily fall out .. if you want it , go for it , but I had bad experiences with this style . I do have small ears though ..  
2	  I really like this bag . I was looking for a bag that can carry almost everything that I use along with the camera . This bag fits EOS 400D ( XTi ) , Tamron 17-50 ( hood reversed ) , EF 50mm 1.8 and the battery charger with cable . There are enough pockets for keeping the other accessories e.g. spare battery or additional CF cards . The bag is quite sturdy and it comes with an AW cover which I have not tried yet . Also the camera handling is really simple , with top loading , it is very easy to take the camera out and place it back later .  
1	  then , the joystick inevitably loses its center , and can not be recalibrated . That 's right . It can not be recalibrated . So , I have a logitech extreme 3d paperweight . It fits the hand nicely , has all the buttons I need and so on , but I can't play any games with it . my character spins leftward and slowly looks down . This stick is junk .  
1	  i got my daughter a logitech prof 3000 web cam , and decided to get logitech quickcam 510 because of digital cam option for home . Read directions , installed software , etc . Digital cam did not work . Had to go to logitech web site to find directions . Found information needed for installing and formating smart media card . I was really disappointed that the directions for using / installing media card were not included in set up directions . ( kinda like they forgot about the digital cam option ) Eventually had to return the cam - prior to ever using it - smart media could not be fomatted - or removed ! and - the pics in low light when used as web cam were really dark .. may consider the prof 3000 that daughter has - low light is better and it has a microphone .. would like to stay with same company for both - however - have heard of other web cams in price range .. I wonder why logitech would not include a formatted smart media card , and / or proper directions and i have submitted that suggestion to the company . still waiting for web purchase to subtract from visa so i can move on - student will graduate from college , and be well into career by the time i get cams working to communicate with her ! LOL  
2	  This item is better than the Sony SRF-M37V . It has better reception , especially in the hills of the Los Angeles area . I don't need iPods , since I want live NPR and DJs . Currently , the number of such " walkman-like " electronics devices is far smaller than was the case ten or twelve years ago , and I don't know anything better , yet this item is also probably discontinued .  
1	  I am on my third replacement of my D-link DIR-615 . The unit kept losing the wireless signal and I would call D link for help and they would put me on hold , forever . Finally , when I would get to talk to someone . It would be , a person that I could not hardly understand , yes everytime . I have a case number of case numbers . The tech support was awfull . I am sorry for having to give this type of a report for D- link . Becuase I have an older D link wireless router , that I have had zero problems with . I wanted to upgrade to a N router , for a better signal . The swicth has been a terrible headache . I feel sorry for the seller , which has been very helpful . I have a total of six D-link devices in my home and have had no problem until this purchase . Please stay away from the DIR-615 D link router .  
1	  Relay works in wet conditions , but they stick in cold weather . If you leave them turned on for 15 minutes or so they 'll heat up enough from the current in the coils to click on .  
1	  complete waste , does not heat up enough , does not even stay warm . Now sitting on a shelf , just a load of rubbish  
1	  I was basically going for a stopgap here - something to play MP3 's on in my car until I get an iPod ( still waiting for that price to come down . ) The good : comes with 12V adaptor / cassette out ( car kit ) . Hasn't skipped at all in response to rough roads or light handling . The bad : Random play isn't random ! The same order will be played each time you choose random . And what 's worse , it won't remember what song you were on when you turned it off . You always start at the same place when you start up . Lastly , if the power adaptor pops out of the socket , which often happens on bumpy roads , the unit shuts off . These have combined for something of a miserable experience on long car rides - you 're in the middle of a 100-song mp-3 CD , hit a bump and the unit shuts off . When you plug it back in and turn it back on , you 're back at the beginning . You have to keep hitting the track skip to get back to where you were . Which could be 80 presses . And the player doesn't handle scratches and dust well at all . Just save up and buy that iPod . That 's what I 'll be doing .  
1	  Bought this frame on sale , lasted about 1 year .. Viewing angle really is horrible , you have to stand right in front of it to see the pics . It does have a nice split screen / random showing of pictures .. not worth the money .. shop around .  
2	  Totally beats that cheap defective Memorex brand . I was so worried that I would encounter the same problems as the Memorex brand , 1 out of 14 worked . So far all of the Maxell Rewritables are working like a charm .  
1	  They sound good and fit tight , but I can't get the wire to straighten out . It 's always coiled - won't lay flat . If Sennheiser could combine these earpieces with Apple 's earbud wire , they 'd have a real winner .  
2	  These speakers have good sound quality , excellent battery life and are easy to install .  
2	  Will extend the life of console games , DVDs and CDs . Provides a thin transparent cover to discs . Protects the surface from kids moving them around and scratching them .  
1	  What more can I say . I went back to my history to warn others of this terrible product with even worse customer service but I see many people have done so already . I purchased the Philips DVDR985 almost a year ago and it quit recording and began having problems reading disks about ten months after purchase . The companys web site list numerous authorized service centers near my home but when you call customer service they tell you the only place to repair this model is in New York . I sent a detailed letter to the address their customer service center provided to me to send my complaint in writing to . the letter was sent back undeliverable . I would gladly forward copies of my letters and email to Amazon if it would help warn off future customers from being taken . I own many Philips products and had very good success with them but this experience has scared me off buying anything else with the Phillips brand . Based on the products repair history , Phillips should recall them all and make good with their customers by repacing the unit with a newer , improved model , if one exists . Could Amazon forward all the complaints about this product to Phillips ? They need to know .  
2	  I just got mine today , I am happy about this . Pro 's -1 . Robust & nicely built . 2 . There is nice little pockets of different size , shape all over for all your other items you want to carry with your laptop . 3 . The shoulder strap is very comfortable . 4 . There is a innovative hidden zipper water bottle pocket - this is cute5 . The laptop compartment is compact , separate , & it has a security strap . 6 . The outer flap close is a click lock & length of which can be adjusted . 7 . The back of the back has zippered sleeve to use that to tie up with your carry on luggage handle ( innovative & useful ) Con 's -1 . The laptop compartment shape is NOT for widescreen laptops . I have a 13.3 " widescreen & it barely fits the length but has space on the sides ( little irritating ) . So , when it says it fits 15.4 " , it may not fit a widescreen laptop . 2 . Apart from the compartment , otherwise also the bag could have been made a little more compact because I see some space on both the sides outside the compartment which again can not be used really for anything effectively . Note : I have read many reviews , people asked for a hand handle , but i think the hand handle would be a negative point considering the style this bag has . overall , I like it , considering the price I got for , its a winner . Edit 26th Nov : After I started extensively using it , I want to update few of my earlier comments1 . It seems that I have also started missing the hand carry handle , it would have been good if it was there2 . Now I dont believe it should have been made more compact ( refer to point no 2 in con section of my original review ) as now I feel it has right amount of space for some additional documents etc which you might want to carry along with your laptop . With this I would probably change my rating to 4.5 stars ..  
2	  Took a trip to Ireland and it worked good on my razer , as well as recharging digital camera batteries . Highly recommended .  
2	  .. with the constant advances in technology , however , the latest camera you buy will tend to be the best ever . This is one great camera for the price . i tried the Nikon D50 , Olympus E500 , Pentax * ist , and went for the Rebel XT . They all had features that I liked but the Canon stood above the rest . If you like shooting in available light , Canon is head and shoulders above the competition . The speed of the camera is very impressive as well . I 'm not going to get into all the specs of the camera since they have already been covered . You can't go wrong with the Rebel XT .  
2	  I ordered this for the dell dimension 2400 that I bought for my birthday . It was running 1 GB but I upgraded it to 1.5 GB . It can run programs like blender 3D and such . Just saying that when your installing it YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE STICK IN SO THAT THE CLIPS FIT INTO THE TOP CREVICES . Thanks to my dad who saw that . Anyway , it 's a whole lot faster and for all of those who keep wondering if it can run more than 1 GB , IT CAN ! So if you have a dell dimension 2400 this is defiantly what you want .  
1	  I got this little guy and it just wouldn't work . I tryed to get it to work with two different computers and it never worked . I suggest that you spend the money and just get a I-pod . These cheaper MP3 players have no garuntee that they will even work .  
2	  I have nothing to object to this product . It does what it 's supposed to do . Price is decent . Go for it , you won't be disappointed .  
2	  First of all , I should state that I use an Apple iBook G4 running OS 10.4 Tiger , so I can't vouch for the potential Windows users reading this review . I should also mention that most of what I scan is black ink line-art ( comics ) , although I have also scanned a number of old color pictures since I 've purchased this scanner . Before I bought this scanner , I was using an HP Scanjet 4600 , which was probably one of the worst products I 've used in my life . The software / driver was so glitchy and slow that it was riduculous . You should have seen the crash log on it ! I decided it was time for a new scanner . I was looking for something around $ 100 . After reading a ton of mixed reviews on scanners in the $ 100 price range , I decided give the Epson Perfection 2480 a whirl . Let 's just say , I was not able to even perform ONE successful scan with it . I 'm not sure if it was faulty hardware , or if Epson 's driver wasn't quite updated for Tiger yet , but after a complete waste of an evening , I promptly returned the Perfection 2480 the next day . And then came the CanoScan 8400F . I ponied up the extra $ 40 bucks or so in hopes to get a better product , and needless to say .. I GOT IT ! It was WELL worth the extra money . The software package is great . It doesn't force you to install items that you may not use ( which is what drove me nuts about the HP scanner I had .. over 100MB of forced installation ! ) . I literally just installed the driver with the basic program called " CanoScan Toolbox X " ( only 1.9 MB ! ) , which lets you set your scanning preferences , preview a scan , and route it to whatever application you want ( in my case , PhotoShop ) . This scanner is SUPER fast ! It probably takes less than twenty seconds to get a full scan . The quality of both my comics and my color photos are terrific ! I haven't scanned any slides yet . My only real complaint is that since I 've had NO problems thusfar , I don't really spend a lot of time with it . I get a fast , clean scan , and then I 'm off to tweaking my comics . I guess that 's how it SHOULD be , though :) A MUST BUY FOR MAC USERS !  
1	  I am very disappointed because this item I bought came empty . I opened the box and I found nothing but some papers and no filter inside it ! Really angry !  
2	  As a new parent , these rechargeable batteries have helped us save money and the environment . Our baby has so many battery operated gear it became ridiculous to keep up with all the batteries needed . Now , we keep a set of AA batteries charging and replenish our baby 's toys , our remotes and anything else quickly and easily . These batteries last a very long time and seem to be as comparable if not more so than regular batteries .  
1	  I purchased this for the same reason everyone elese did . To capture vhs movies in my comp . Since the pinnacle web site had so much to say about it ( at that time ) I did buy it . It is completely unaxceptable video to convert into dvd format .. and like the others say , pinnacle has no support on this product , seems like they never made it or sold it .. no drivers no updates .. etc .. a real piece of junk that I can't even sell . On ebay at $ 10 .. a real shame ..  
2	  In looking for an effective tool to back up my PC incase of a crash this drive fit my needs . So far it has worked great and the software which is the most important element in backing up works well . Also handy to store any large files and pictures . I recommend it after doing a lot of research into which drive could do this job the best .  
2	  I bought this product to go with a new Onkyo AV Receiver . It works great ! The only question I had when hooking it all up was that I could not find it written anywhere that you didn't need a separate audio cable from the Tuner to the Receiver . Turned out the cable that came with the tuner , ( a DIN type ) , provided everything needed . I still don't know why there is a Optical Out Audio Jack if you don't need it .  
2	  I have been searching for the best portable sport headphones since 1984 . I found them in 2006 . These things do not slip or fall out and provide the best bass reproduction I have ever heard in an ear-bud . I do not need to use any contrivance to make these things stay put in my ears and I am an avid jogger / off-road cyclist who puts them to the test at least 4 days per week . I have sweat all over them and exposed them to driving rain and snow and the sound quality remains , although I 've found that after such regular use and wear they will develop a short-circuit after about a year . Unless you are as rough on them as I am you should have nada to fear ! Even if you are that rough on them , you should just suck that up as a cost of doing business and get a pair . I have no complaints .  
2	  This is a perfect bag for the camera we bought for out son and daughter for Christmas . It fits their Canon EOS Rebel T3i perfectly , along with their additional lens . The bag is durable and yet lightweight .  
1	  All I have to say is read the other reviews and I am having all those problems and more . I am also returning this item for something better . Our battery has never charged from the day we bought it and the screen goes blank all the time and you have to start over by unpluging it . Just a pain in the neck to own this machine . This is ment to make your life easier not harder and more madening .  
2	  This card is great . I can play all my PC games at high resolution . It is more than enough power to run the latest games . Before buying this card I was severly limited . Highly recommended for those unlucky souls without an AGPort on their PC . Priced at 59.99 , this card can't be beat .  
2	  Very short review only : You can't get a better unit for the price ! This MP3 player will play any speed and with no skip . If you 're looking for a dependable MP3 player and don't mind spending a little extra to get a lot of unit , this is the one !  
2	  I really like this hood . It is solidly built , has velvet on the inside to soften the light it allows in , and it really protects your lens .  
1	  This is about to go back to Amazon . I have spent literally hours trying to get this player to work with content downloaded from the New York Public library using OverDrive Media Console . First I needed to upgrade the firmware , whatever Amazon sold me was outdated . Then I had to change some settings ( they weren't available in the earlier firmware version ) . Then .. still have problems . I hate Apple 's fetishization of COOL but at least iTunes works . Digital music players would NEVER had taken off if the industry needed to rely on Redmond to figure this one out . Total frustration . I think I 'm going back to cassettes . Oh , some other stuff . THe player looks much better in the picture than in real life . It 's very light and looks to be delicately built . The switches have that cheap feel and the controls are not well located . The screen is OK . I 'm too old for this kind of thing and have no trouble reading it .  
1	  The player itself was on the thicker side , but with this case on , it made it just rediculous . on top of that , the case was loose and din't fit right , and it made things look kind of ugly , and i couldn't take it . i took it off five minutes after i put it on . I hated it . I couldn't figure out how to put the belt clip on , and there were no instructions to tell me how .  
2	  After having a Harmon Kardon receiver for almost 20 years that died a graceful death , my purchase before this TEAC was only about 2 years ago ( big mistake was the latest purchase - a " refurbished " product from another vendor . Within 2 years it had a significant background hum ) . I really like this TEAC unit for several reasons . I have never had a receiver with a remote , and it is nice to not have to keep opening and closing the audio center doors to operate it . More importantly to me is the fact that I have seen very few audio receivers that support a turntable , and I have a great collection of old vinyl - sometimes I like to reminisce ! For those interested , my needs are for more background music , so I can't comment on how it sounds amped up full tilt , but overall , I think this was a great value and suits my needs just fine .  
1	  Replaced an old Blaupunkt cassette unit with this one mainly because of the USB function . On paper this unit sounds outstanding - MP3 with ID3 tag display , USB input , 200 watts , etc .. Unfortunately I have not had much luck in getting the usb port to read any mp3 files from any flash media ( have tried 5 different brands now ) . Of note is that it does recognize the usb media being connected but is unable to recognize the MP3 files on it . Also , the CD mechanism is by far and away the worst I have ever seen - It will skip just sitting in the driveway , not even driving ! Completely unsat for a car audio system . Next time I am going to stick with a major brand and spend the extra money . The only good thing to say is that is seems to have good sound quality so if you listen to the radio all the time this unit would be alright .  
2	  I 've lost files because of drive failures before , and have wondered how much I am willing to lose next time . I chose the 160GB drive because the other Smartdisks I 've purchased have been reliable , and the FireWire has made them fast . Very pleased with this purchased .  
1	  Don't get this item ! It totally destroyed my disks , so I had to get new ones . Whoever made this junk should be totally ashamed of themselves !  
1	  I completely regret purchasing this item . I had this product for a month in a half before opening the box . When I opened the box and started using the item , it broke . It wouldnt turn on and when I contacted customer service it was just grief . That is after an employee of the award winning customer service hung up on me the first time . When I then called back and spoke to a manager , he misinformed me of their policy and waited a month to return the deffective product . I wish I never purchased this product . You would think after they sold me expensive , and deffective equipment they would go out of their way to replace it or fix it , but they didnt . I would not encourage anyone in buying thid product and I wish I never did . It was a birthday gift and it came back to smack me in the face  
1	  I bought this thru Amazon and have had nothing but bad luck almost from the stat Grey vertical lines startes to appear , called cable to see if it was that , not no it 's the TV gone bad , hard to watch the picture and very uneven viewing , warranty gone and if a repair guy came it would cost 1335.00 before he looked at and they say Magnavox is great for that . So I guess I leanred my lesson no more from AmazonI 'll have to wait till if breaks complelty I paid close to 1000.00for this thing ! UGH !  
1	  I was disappointed at the instructions being less than heplful in knowing that the charging of the product for 4 hours prior to use was necessary or it would stop working . It was not revealed anywhere that the product had to be removed from car dock every day to be charged even if it was in the car charger and would stop working and have to be reset , which no instructions how to correct , warnings or directions are given . And last , not easily to get technical support on the phone .  
2	  My wife 's new car didn't come with a casette player , so we picked up the iRock . This works very well , so long as there are no radio stations interferring . I can place the iRock and iPod anywhere in the car , and get decent reception . I do have to crank up the volume on the iPod to get a good , non-distorted sound out of the car stereo . This isn't what you should use if you 're looking for sound quality equal to what you 'd expect right out of the audio device . This transmits on radio frequency , so it 's subject to interference . But as far as listening to music wherever I have access to a radio .. this thing works perfect .  
2	  I bought this FM Transmitter for my iPod so I can listen to it when I drive tractor ( since they don't have any CD players ) , so the day my iPod came in ( it came after the FM Transmitter did ) so the next day taht I went to work I tried it out , and I 've never heard such a good quality of music through that radio . In other words , this product rocks . If you want quality , buy either this FM Transmitter , or the newer one that Monster make now !

1	  I am returning this item . Users cannot hear me over the consistent hum . I tried varying the mic level and the speaker level in case noise was caused by some sort of feedback . Tried moving to a quieter room , even turning the mic volume completely off . The noise level was still almost halfway up on the input volume indicator ! I 'm an IT professional and it is obvious to me that this unit is defective .  
2	  i purchased the furman mp-15 along with the floodstop for a second floor laundry room . i found the instructions overwhelming and not for a novice homeowner . i actually wound up following the review of another amazon customer who uploaded pics and a step by step of how to hook up both the furman and the floodstop together . i tested both units and they worked fine . the cord is very long and can reach if your main outlet is farther away . although if placed next to main outlet , there is a lot of cord to contend with . if you dont tie wrap it , it can look messy and get in the way .  
1	  Heavy , slow , Ugly with the worst music management software I have ever use . I returned it and bought an iPod ..  
1	  No denying Apple makes great products , but this is NOT one of them . They spent their money on the visual design and forgot that in order for the item to function it needed to be sturdy . The cord on this WILL break and you will need to buy another . The cord is too thin to withstand anything more than occasional use . Apple should be ashamed of this one and I 'm surprised there hasn't been a recall .  
1	  Seagate has attractive packaging , graphics , and web page , but it 's product and customer service are very poor , in my opinion . I bought this external drive a year ago . It worked fine for 10 months , then reported errors on it like " file or directory is corrupted and unreadable . " Also " File $ Mft is corrupt and unreadable . " I ran Seagate software and Chkdsk to repair the problems , but my efforts were not always successful , but always time-consuming . Seagate sent me a used replacement drive , and it has the same problems ! This product seems unreliable , which is the problem you buy an external drive to avoid . Reliable backup is key . Customer service by phone with Seagate is almost impossible , real torture , huge waste of time . Rather than try a third drive , I have written off this purchase and will avoid Seagate in the future . BTW I have another external hard drive by a different manufacturer , and it works fine .  
2	  I knew little about camcorders when I bought this . It got mixed reviews , but I 've been extremely happy with it . It 's simple to use and the video quality is very good . The 20x zoom is a nice feature , as well as the ability to store video on the MiniDV or a SmartCard . I would recommend it to anyone .  
2	  This is a great little pda for those who want to keep track of dates , phone numbers and such-it 's not meant to be more ! I think it 's great for what it 's meant to do and the price makes it extremely attractive ! I had a Tungsten E before this and I loved it but , as my life has changed so have my needs and this fits the bill perfectly !  
1	  This hairdryer was my favorite one until it mysteriously stopped working one day for no reason . When it did work , it dried my hair ( thick & wavy ) in about 5 minutes ! I also loved the retractable cord . When unfolded , this is a full size hairdryer and it is weighty which I liked about it . However , it won't turn on less than 1 year after I got it . I have had previous hair dryers for years with no problems . This is not an expensive hair dryer so it was great while it lasted . I am giving it two stars because it didn't last . ( while it worked , I 'd give it a 5 )  
2	  I recently got this and so far I love it . Picture quality is amazing if you have a 1080i TV , I wish I did this sooner .  
1	  Read the product description carefully . The first half is dedicated to the flexible webcam arm / stand . This is the product I wanted . The second part is a rendevous pack ( condoms , etc . ) . This is NOT what I wanted , but that was what was shipped .  
2	  Just to be " clear " , this product has an opaque black back half , and a clear hinged top which has the 4 tabs to hold a label insert . It IS the thin , single disk storage / distribution case at a decent price , and I got the super saver free shipping .  
1	  DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE ! This mouse has given me nothing but frustration . 1 . The front of the mouse where the buttons are located is extremely low , causing a muscle strain in your hand if you use it for long periods of time . 2 . Battery life is horrible . Like 2 weeks .. 3 . When your mouse is idle for 8 minutes , it goes into an automatic sleep mode . The manual says to touch the metal lines on the side to " revive " it but when I do it simply freeze the cursor on the screen . So I have to reboot my computer . Absolutely the worst !

1	  This is the first time I purchased a product by Tiffen . I 'm using this UV Protection filter mainly for the protection of my new lens , and I assume most people purchase a UV filter for the same reason . The main drive for me to choose this product is because of the reduced price and the 10-year warranty . Being a simple UV filter , there aren't any extra effects except the advertised " Helps eliminate bluish cast in images . " My prints just came back , and I can't really see too much of a difference with my untrained eyes .  
1	  They just copied description of 8082 which has privacy codes . I just returned the radios after finding they have no privacy codes . There is much difference between with or without privacy codes .  
2	  I 've had this USB drive for about 3 months now , and I absolutely love it . I like to carry around my USB drives on my keychain , and durability has always been an issue . However , this device has a solid , all-metal construction , and an extremely handy and secure retracting mechanism . I get great performance from the drive as well . The U3 software can be helpful for some , although for me , I fail to find it as useful . Fortunately , Sandisk now provides a way to remove the bundled U3 software from the drive itself , turning it into a standard 2gb USB drive . There are cheaper 2gb flash drives out there , but none of them would last nearly as long as the Cruzer Titanium . For the quality that you get , the price simply cannot be beat .  
2	  Worked grreat from the start . I did have it professionally installed because I just changed to cable internet . Would highly recommend this product .  
1	  you need to be very very very patient to operate this dvd player . if you can waste your time on it than you can waste your money on it .  
1	  This is a review of the FM18 head only . The head appears well-built - all-metal and it feels substantial . However , the head moves slightly in one direction when the pan lock knob is tightened , ruining the shot . Spend $ 100 more ( for a Bogen or a Gitzo ) and get a much better result .  
2	  its a christmas gift for the wife so I don't know what they sound like yet .  
1	  I have had this camera for about 3 years and am very dissapointed with it . After taking pictures on a trip , that can't be reshot , I learned there was a short in the flash system . None of my indoor pictures turned out . I took it in for repair and learned it had to go back to the company . Four months and $ 87.00 later I got my camera back . It worked for less than a year and did the same thing . Needless to say I didn't spend any more money on it . Meanwhile I lost some irreplaceable pictures once again . I will never buy Samsung again !  
1	  I bought this item 7 months ago . It came with good condition but I hate the camera . Pictures aren't clear . The pictures taken with this camera are low quality and blurry . I wish I returned it . Don't waste your money with this camera . - Huri  
1	  It is so true that you get what you pay for ! These batteries barely hold a charge . I got only 20 photos from one and none from the other . Do not waste your money .  
2	  It 's been a few months and haven't seen any issues . Works as expected and not too expensive .  
1	  This lamp deserves a minus 10 star rating and even that might be too high . This lamp blew out twelve ( 12 ) days after it was installed . When I went through the process to return it , the seller , Lamp Monsters LLC , wasn't anywhere in the loop . Amazon , not the seller , refunded the purchase price and shipping . After looking at it closely as I was packaging it to send it back , I found it 's not from Sony but some cheap , poorly made after market piece of junk manufacturer . Don't be lured by cheap prices on what appears to be the real deal from Lamp Monsters LLC - if it looks too good to be true it will be junk and Lamp Monsters LLC will be selling it .  
2	  The Terk TV senderTerk Technologies Leapfrog LF-30S Wireless 2.4 GHz A / V Distribution Systemis a marvelous little device to avoid renting a second cable box , especially if you have a second tv location with no cable wall outlet . Not complicated to set up , but consider where the big metal things are in your house ( a / c , fridge , file cabinets ) and keep them out of line of sight transmission for best reception .  
1	  I bought this cable because the price was alright , and the reviews were good , unlike many other cables . I should have read the reviews better , as the first one never commented on image quality , only that adding length makes it longer . The second one hadn't even installed it . Well , I installed it , and the ghosting is horrible ! I can see text , and then 4 ghosted images of the text next to it . Do not buy this cable .  
2	  It vibrates a bit , but that is easy to forgive in light of the really attractive design , a black-sheen case that evokes nothing less than a futuristic bible . Or maybe a Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy . The Essential edition sports a green circle of light , and a single USB2 connection . The Essential edition is the budget edition of the line , lacking a FireWire connection and without a second ring of light that indicates ( on the Premium and Pro editions ) how much room is left on the drive . But who needs that ? And personally I prefer the green illumination , anyway . The circle of light doubles as an on / off button , conveniently located on the front . You may not need to tap that button much though , since the drive senses when you Shut Down ( or Hibernate or Stand-By ) your computer and automatically turns off . Essentially , the design of the case and the automatic on / off are the two main reasons why these drives have become so popular within weeks of their debut . It took me three weeks to score one of these on sale . You 've probably read that the vents are a code . It reportedly spells out words such as " innovative " , " reliable " , " personal " , " design " , and " simple " . The design of this drive is certainly innovative . The last memorable time when a designer got involved in making a case for an external hard drive was when the LaCie company hired F.A. Porche , but Porche , in what one could speculate was a bit of a cruel joke on LaCie , turned in a generic metallic brick ( ooh I bet that angered LaCie ) . Western Digital , in contrast , has turned in a strikingly elegant case that would look great on a shelf . Expect other companies to follow suit with shelf-worthy case designs , now that good aesthetics have been introduced to this formerly purely-functional line of products . One small unexpected complaint . You can see why they dubbed it " My Book " , but rather inconveniently for anyone who is actually writing a book and already has a folder named " My Book " , this drive is formatted with the name pre-designated as " My Book " . But authors need not worry ; that name is easily erased when one reformats the drive to the NTFS standard that current computers use ( like nearly all hard drives , it arrives formatted in the old FAT32 format to accomodate users of older computers ) . Just plug it in , reformat the drive to NTFS ( which takes an hour or so for a drive this size ) , and then it is ready to serve you . The drive came with some software on it , but none of it is needed . So far , so good . If no one reports any design flaws , I expect people will be " swearing by " this book .. ok that pun was lame . Four stars rather than five , because of the slight vibration .  
1	  This my third set of headphones from Sennheiser in the PMX-70/80 line . They have all failed in the same way - loose connection at the headphone jack . After 2 months , this set is dead . I 'm returning it under warranty , but I 'm going to start looking for another brand . Strongly recommend you do the same . Update : Sennheiser denied the warranty claim because the headphones were not purchased from an authorized reseller . Be warned or stay away !  
2	  I got this card because it was the best Nvidia card I could find that my 305W Dell power supply could handle . I 'm currently using it with a Viewsonic 19 " widescreen monitor . It was my first time installing a new graphics card on my own , and the instructions included for putting it in were easy to read and understand . They include some good tips for beginners . Up until I turned my computer on again , it was fine . Once I popped in the installation CD , it wouldn't find video card so I couldn't install the drivers from the CD . This was after uninstalling previous drivers , and my comptuer was in fact picking up the new card . So , I went ahead and got the drivers off Nvidia 's site . I recommend doing this either way , since this way you can be * sure * you 're getting the latest drivers . After installing and restarting , I tried to change my resolution to my previous 1440x900 . No dice . There were other higher resolutions , but not this particular one , even after fiddling with the refresh rate . So I went ahead and opened up the Nvidia control panel and manually customized the resolution settings . It 's not hard to find the right values to enter online , so if you 're having the same problem I had a quick google search should give you what you need . Once that was done , I played a quick game ( not particularly graphics intensive ) , and it did run much more smoothly compared to the ATI card I had before and even better compared to the integrated graphics I had to deal with when the ATI card died on me . I 'll try some other games and update my review with the results I get . Pros : - Good price for a card in this range . - Includes a couple of accessories which might be useful for some . - Good instructions for first-timers in regards to physical installation . - Easy installation with the right drivers ( which must be taken from the Nvidia site , at least in my case ) . - Once issues are resolved , works pretty well . Cons : - No Direct X 10 support-though I don't need this , and I suspect that someone who does would be looking at a different one . - Software was useless in my case , could be a problem if you don't know how to find the drivers . - Workarounds for resolution problems might be confusing to beginners . Overall , this is a great upgrade if you 're using your pc 's onboard graphics currently , though it does have its faults . I 'd recommend this to anyone whose power supply can't handle one of the better cards out there or anyone looking for a decent upgrade from a low end card or integrated graphics . Just be aware that you might have some little problems here and there , but these can be solved rather quickly if you know what to do . Edit : This card is still going strong 3 years later . I 've since built my own PC with a different card , but my boyfriend inherited my old Dell with this video card and I don't think he 's had any problems at all . Obviously you can't put the settings all the way up for gaming , but it works !  
2	  If you are not a computer person and just need a simple mouse pad this will do for its cheap price .  
2	  My mom recently purchased these speakers for very cheap ( 149 USD ) . I just love the sound it gives out . Movies , games and my music collection sound incredible through these wonderful speakers . They have design and versatility in mind . When I have friends over ( 17 + ) they ask me , " What in the world are these ? Are these some fancy speakers .. and they 're 5.1 SURROUND SOUND ? " I answer , " why , yes ! " and smile . The first time I heard them was like if I were in heaven , I was listening to music tracks that came included in this sound-card adapter ( M-Audio Sonica ) I needed for my PowerBook in order to truly get the surround sound experience ; I couldn't believe my ears . A couple of tears litellaly came down my eyes when I heard how wonderful my Promedia GMX D-5.1 sounded . I highly recommend them . Make great gifts !  
1	  Bought this item and it didn't fit in my m675 plug as they pretend . It doesn't have the electrical cord , so If it had fit , I also would have to buy a electrical cord to use the adapter . This is crap .  
1	  Cable connection is loose . I had to tape cables and this thing together in order to get a stable ping . Otherwise 90 % packet loss . I tried several different cables and it was all the same . I ended up buying a 2-pack of similar couplers / slitter on a sale for the same price from one of Chinese stuff sites . They do work .  
2	  I am a truck driver by trade and I had one before and it was great I used it till it wore out and brok on my one day . ; I could never find another one till now and I am buying one because this AX-2 is by far the best bluetooth I have ever had . I was lost when my other one broke on me it worked so well . I have a minor hearing loss in both ears and this gives me the best hearing of phone conversations of any bluetooth I have ever used . If you buy one buy 2 to have a spare they are that good .  
2	  I love this bag . I use it to carry my Nikon D200 and 2 lenses . Its weatherproof , plenty of space for 4 more lens etc . However , I think I should have gone for 350 version which would have some space for my laptop too . But this is a bargain . If you do want to use it for purely your camera , then way to go . I find it little difficult to carry my tripod in this bag though .  
2	  Used these speakers as front speakers for some time now , recently upgraded to the 70 's Polk Monitor Speakers and moved them to the back of the system as the rear speakers . Totally happy with the Polk Monitors 50 's and 70 's . You 'll probably need a subwoofer to bring these to perfection .  
1	  Was very disappointed to find that I had to spend $ 100 a year to look at my photo 's , mostly because it is not mentioned anywhere in the listing on Amazon . Sent it back without even plugging it in ..  
1	  Customer / Technical Service Sucks ! TV Power and Remote control unreliablequote of message to Philips ) The purpose of this message is to file a FORMAL COMPLAINT for the mediocre service received from Philips first through the authorized service center and now from Philips Manufacturing System . Our first Plasma TV was bought back in Nov . 2.2006 . Early this year the Tv just went dead and after 2 week of waiting the technician diagnosed a sort of damaged Power Box . Since they were unable to get the part in back order it was finally decided to replace the TV for a brand new ( AFTER A WHOLE MONTH FOLLOWING THE TICKET OPENING DATE ) . On the second TV the Remote Control stop working right after the TV was installed . Now Philips Customer Service says that the Remote Control ( part 242254900635 ) will not be available until May . 15 ( OVER A MONTH AFTER THE SERVICE TICKET WAS OPENED ) . There are no words to describe the lack of manufacturing planning and poor customer service . Not to say that , if existent , this is a clear evidence of the poor performance of your Product Management Dept . While I receive the replacement part I will take time to file the obvious review on Philips in every single site dedicated to receive Customer Reviews ( CNET . , Yahoo Shopping , Amazon , Shopping . com , to mention a few ) Thank you for nothing . ( unquote )  
1	  I was not very pleased with this product . It does offer a large list of stations to choose from , but none of them were clear at all . I 'm not talking a little static ( that 's to be expected ) I mean , you couldn't hear the music over the static noise .  
1	  .. unless you want to type on a keyboard with the key designations worn away . Over time , all of the used keys wear so that the letters cannot be read . Also it looks crummy when the keys wear . You cannot get replacement keys from the manufacturer either . I tried . Not only were replacement keys not available , the girl " helping " me was a snippy little b-h . The keys are backlit and the lighting is uneven from the start . The keyboard is okay , if you don't mind the keys looking bad after use .  
1	  This product is difficult to set up mainly because it is one of those one button , two lights , hold it down for so many seconds sort of deal . I could not get this set up with a secure network . Then I went and tried no security and it worked . Then I did mac filtering on my router to make it somewhat secure but cannot do the same on this device . Really terrible interface , instructions , and you really never know what is going on while setting up because the lights give you two possible statuses : not working and working . Personally , I do not recommend this . Not user friendly at all .  
2	  First digital camera and WOW , great camera for an Amateur . Easy to use with my limited knowledge of all things technical and as I learn more it also has many capabilities . Love the large viewer ( if that is what it is called ) 3 " and for someone who has a hard time seeing it is great . In less than 1/2 hr was up and running with it , had pics on computer and was emailing them away . No technical review here , just an ordinary person that is happy with her great choice of a wonderful camera . Good luck .  
2	  The world has gone digital and yet Olympus produced one of the best 35mm cameras out there just as film cameras were becoming obsolete . It 's a shame because this camera kicks [ .. ] , because it 's simple to use , produces amazing shots and has a great zoom / lens , autofocus , battery life ( beats any digital camera ) and it feels great in my hand . I 've taken many shots with it , including B & W shots , which are even greater than color shots . I 've also taken tons of night shots , including auroras , which I never knew how to do before . This camera works especially well with Fuji film . I want to buy another one before they get rid of film cameras forever . Sad .  
1	  The ink cartridges that I received from TonerPals were NOT Genuine Epson ink as advertised . They were used cartridges filled with inferior ink . I should have known better than to expect a quality product for such a low price but my greed got the best of me . I started to return them as soon as I received them but thought to myself " What the heck - I 'll try a non-genuine cartridge once in my life and see what happens " . BIG MISTAKE ! Not being a prolific printer it took me several weeks to notice that my yellow nozzle was clogged so I started my arduous process of multiple nozzle cleanings , nozzle soakings and even a REAL yellow cartridge that I purchased locally to try to push the bad stuff out with . The stuff in that cartridge may just as well been glue for all it did to my printer . When another color ran out from all of the cleanings , I just gave up and purchased another printer . The only places that I will buy ink from in the future are in a local store or from the manufacturer online . That way , I can be sure I am getting GENUINE Epson ink !  
2	  I bought this because my Netgear router wasn't working . The only problem I 've had is that I can't access the printer on our network and Linksys customer support sucks . They told me they were transferring me to get help but actually transferred me to a third party CS that wanted me to pay about $ 25 for tech support . But , that one issue aside , I have not had any problems with this router . I work from home and I count on my internet and this has been very reliable . I also have it connected to my Insignia Blue-ray player and it works great ! When I had my Netgear hooked up , it would take forever to connect to Netflix if at all and I was getting timed out on my internet connection . I would definitely recommend this router for a wired home network especially if you are wanting to use Netflix .  
2	  This is a very good case . Everything worked as advertised . I found it easy to install the components .  
1	  Setup was simple . Range was good . That 's where it ends . I bought this thing because CNET gave it their prestigious " Editor 's Choice " award . I 'll never make that mistake again . Go ahead and read personal reviews there after this and you will see that I 'm not alone . DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER . It kept randomly dropping the connection , requiring a reboot to get it working again . It gets really old rebooting the router 5 times per day , trust me . Tech support will blame everything except the router . Don't bother calling them . This is a very common problem with this router . The guys at COMP USA said that they have had a lot of them returned for the same reason . Don't waste any more time . Go buy the Netgear wireless router , and cards for that matter ( especially if you 're running Win XP ) . My system is working flawlessly now . I couldn't be happier .  
2	  This is the ultimate GPS . I have the msn direct working great , I have the GPS working great , all these things going right and one small issue that wont affect most people . If you are a Treo 700P user , the bluetooth has an error , that displays the last number called instead of the current number called . Called Garmin , they say no fix in place . But with the exception of that one thing , this is hands down the greatest GPS I have ever touched . Big bright screen , responsive buttons , accurate mapping , voices that pronounce correctly ( tom tom users eat your heart out ) . I considered the 660 but for a year of MSN Direct and its features , it was clearly worth it . UPDATE ! If you update Sprint phone software for the treo 700p to 1.10 your bluetooth issue will go away .  
1	  I just got into photography as a major hobby and got a new fuji camera that uses this memory card . I recently went to buy one of those memory card computor adaptors and the bloke from the counter told me there weren't any standard kind for this memory card ! This was a major disadvantage for me in my class and can be a disadvantage if you bought ( or received for x-mas ) a [ bad ] fugi camera . So now I just have to use the regular lousy way of hooking the camera up to the computor and waisting my batteries . ( and it takes a day to recharge those things ) That is the worst thing about this memory card . It 's expensive ( though I take all cards are ) too and it holds well , unless you make a film with it .  
2	  This review is for the ' Recoton PowerWave 200 Amplified FM Antenna ( FM200 ) ' . I 've been using mine for years & thought I would finally write a review for it . The FM200 has a state of the art design , & it 's circuitry make 's it the most unique & precise antenna for tuning in clear stereo sound from even the most distant stations !  
2	  FANTASTIC camcorder ! Awesome stills and vids . Highly recommended for beginning user based on low price and ease of use ! Only tough part is converting video 's . Still recommend to any user looking for HD quality !  
2	  This fan can be connected directly to power supply through the adapter or to the three pins on the motherboard so that the fan speed can be automatically adjusted . This fan is not the quietest at full speed , but pushes out enough air to keep the case cool .  
2	  love it thanks received it fast and exactly what I wanted very happy with it would bye it again thanks  
1	  The battery , which you have to supply yourself , is terrible .. worked 10 minutes , replaced them and it worked for a couple of pictures . It does not have a re-chargable battery . There is no card included either . I should have thought about this before buying but assumed that all new cameras have a re-chargable battery . I think i will return it .  
2	  This web cam is so awesome ! It is very clear and streams extremely well . I received it promptly even in the bad weather !  
2	  Great transition camera from point and shoot to DSLR . I have had several point and shoot digital cameras from Olympus , Kodak , and Canon . The pictures were satisfactory , but after seeing photos taken with this camera , I was intrigued . This is my first DSLR camera and I 'm not a professional photographer . I 'm just a regular person who wants to preserve memories . I was looking for a camera that would take great photos and was easy to use . This camera fulfilled both criteria . Right out of the box it took beautiful photos and it 's very easy to use . It 's so fun to use I find myself grabbing it over and over to take pictures . I enjoy scrapbooking and these photos will enhance my scrapbook pages . So far I 've used the auto setting , child setting , and macro setting . Each worked great . My favorite is the child setting because it highlights the child and blurs the background a little bit . This camera is going to capture moments I would have missed with my old point and shoot . I ordered it from Amazon with overnight shipping because it wasn't very expensive and it was here the next day . This kit has everything you need to get started except for a SD card so make sure you have one on hand or order one at the same time so you can start taking pictures right away . This is the best purchase I have made in years !  
1	  My Nuvi came with this kit , but I only got the adhesive disk to stay a few days , and that 's without having the unit suctioned on full-time . The suction cup sticks great - so much so that I have to break the seal even after releasing the lever . But I can't have it on my windshield full time and am sure the adhesive disk will not stay on in August / September , even if I could get it to stay on now . I do not see a way to purchase just the disk ( guess I 'll contact Garmin directly ) . I can't even just lay the Nuvi on a flat spot unless I disconnect the power cable . I suppose I will be forking out an additional $ 30 to try the beanbag .  
1	  This thing is just okay . The on / off switch is backwards .. hmm . It will test UTP cables .. and that 's it . So if that 's all you need , and you don't mind off for on , on for off , then it 's fine .. the price is right . Materials are okay .. not too fragile , lightweight . Takes a 9v , which weighs about the same as the actual equipment . The remote piece tucks into the main body so it 's pretty compact . Overall I would pay a little more and get a more robust gadget with more to it . Recommended for keeping it simple , not recommended if you 're doing more than testing for continuity / connectivity .  
2	  With the use of this dock and my Bose computer speakers I have mad a truly portable entertainment center . My one complaint is that the installed battery wore out in about two weeks .  
1	  I 've had these for a little while , and there horrible . Buy something else . My reasons : The sound quality isn't as good as most headphones out their , the sound sounds muffled with too much bass , also there extremely uncomfortable . It feels like my ears are suffocating or something . its hard to describe . If you need a new pair , u should steer away from these .  
1	  It took me 3 + days to get this thing to work with my notebook . Cannot get it to work with my desktop . Tech support was no help at all . They just had me retrying things I already did . If your not a networking wizard do not buy this router . Newer models don't need the manual setup of this one .  
1	  It was okay while it worked . Sound quality wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either and microphone quality was decent . The inline volume control and microphone switch were convenient . Unfortunately it didn't last . The main problem was the cord . Despite being rather thick it developed bad connections in many places . The volume control also became scratchy . Finally one of the drivers broke . Because of all these problems I cannot recommend this headset .  
2	  I love this product ! I got this for my 4 yr old son for christmas and he loves it . He likes not having to put every cd back in its original case anymore . It really is a perfect way for him to be able to access his cds easier and put them away too ! The cd incerts slide out easy and swivel which is really nice . The handle on top is a nice feature to so they can bring it along if they want . I was surprised at how well it was made too ! I was hoping it would be sturdy enough for my son and it worked out perfect ! It was even a great price ! Its definetly worth it to buy this product for your kids . They will love it !  
2	  I have purchased and used a wide variety of keyboards that I have either worn out or they just were not right for me . I thought the Logitech Wireless Illuminated K800 was one of the best until it began to go crazy with inserting random letters while typing reviews and documents in Word . When I read the reviews on the Saitek Eclipse II ( I am not a gamer ) I decided to try it out . What a keyboard - no learning curve here ! Other than the keys make a slight clicking sound which is a happy and productive sound to me rather than objectionable ) and the back light comes in gamer colors of blue , orchid , and red ( default is blue which I keep on ) , it is one fine keyboard . The wrist rest attachment is adjustable , as is the keyboard , and can be left off if you are short on real estate space or you choose not to use it . The keys are spaced so that getting your fingers on the wrong row or keys is minimal . I type rather fast and the keys have a substantial feel to them which I really like . The black and silver ( chrome ) color combo not only matches my laptop , printer and accessories but is very attractive . The instructions are basic and not too specific but if you have problems , there are several ways you can contact the company with questions . The keyboard , wrist attachment , and manual were neatly packaged within its own retail box and then again in the shipping box and arrived within two days after I placed my order . After seeing the Saitek Eclipse II , my son is seriously thinking about getting one to use as either backup or primary keyboard . I will gladly recommend this keyboard to my family members and friends and verse two - if something goes wrong with this keyboard on down the line , I will gladly replace it with another Saitek Eclipse .  
2	  These DVD + RW 's work great with our Gateway DVD player . And you can't beat the great low price .  
2	  The product works well . It keeps my daughter very happy in the car which keeps me happy !  
1	  Perhaps I got one of the first ones off the assembly line , because I have encountered nothing but problems over thirty months of use . Using the WPC-11 PCMCIA cards , I have encountered constant connectivity " hangs " over the months , always requiring me to hit the reset switch on the back of the unit to regain a connection to the Internet . Too late to return the unit and 3 wireless cards - stuck with the thing . Downloaded and successfully installed 3 firmware upgrades to no avail , including 1.39.2 , 1.42.7 , and 1.44.2 . Tech support , somewhere in India or Pakistan , told me my chip set is damaged , even though the unit has been plugged into APC UPS with filters , etc . for the last 30 months . When the unit did work , I never got better than 30 foot range . Beyond that the signal would degrade to the point of no connectivity . Company unwilling to offer a coupon or discount on latest and greatest unit , so I 'll move on as you should . A Dissatisfied Customer  
1	  The camera barely fit inside the case and it does not have a strap for ease of handling . It does have a belt loop handle but it is made to slide onto your belt as opposed to a clip-on which is far more convienant . I would not recommend .  
2	  Being a college student , I don't have a load of money to throw around trying to find a really nice pair of comfortable headphones with great sound . I did my research on different brands , read quite a few reviews , and ended up taking my chances on this pair . I absolutely love them . I use them almost non-stop and it sounds like the musicians are in the room ! The sound clarity is unparalleled . The volume does not need to be blasting to hear every instrument and soft note . And best of all , these mute outside noises , so I can put them on while others are blasting a TV and I won't hear anything but my music . These headphones are not flimsy like others and hold up very well , but if I do break them , I will buy another pair immediately . For the price and quality , this is an amazing deal . Buy a pair !  
2	  This item is absolutely awesome for any slide show presentation or movies . Received item in a timely fashion in perfect condition . Mahalo nui loa , Cerise : 0 )  
1	  It doesn't contain any installation instructions ! ? ! ? ! How do I know how to install it ? And get it functioning ? It needs to have instructions . Please .  
2	  The Bose Companion 3 's are an inspiring set of multimedia speakers . I have listened to many , and I chose these over the Logitechs and Klipsch 's . The satellites jump out at you . Dialogue sounds from movies are very loud , distinct and , clear . Low , mid and high notes are articulated very well and great right and left ( stereo ) separation adds to the experience . I must add this tidbit : these speakers are the only ones I 've heard that will ( from time to time ) produce sounds that literally sound like they are coming from right next to your ear . I 've heard speaker manufacturers say " these speakers will tickle your ear " , but this is taking it to extremes ! I have actually been startled ( nay freaked out ) by some of the sound effects I 've heard . I have also heard sounds that seem to come out of nowhere . You have been forewarned , listening to these speakers can be adventuresome ! The subwoofer is impressive . It is only a 5 " driver but it puts out tight controlled bass . It does have the ability to produce low , deep , rumbling sounds if called upon . The sounds are quite satisfying . Bear in mind , these are advertised as multimedia / desktop speakers and are designed as such . They aren't designed to fill a large room ( like the Logitechs or Klipsch 's ) so don't expect them to produce sound audible in the nearest adjacent county . Unlike the others , these are designed to be placed on a desktop next to your computer monitor ( hence the puck control ) . The subwoofer is designed to fit under the desk or other convenient place unlike the Logitech Z-5500 's whose subwoofer requires an additional room to house . Weaknesses : The high notes seem to missing . If there are frequencies above 13,000hz they won't be audible . These are the really high notes for those of you unfamiliar with sound frequencies . If you are a casual listener , you won't miss it . I do wish I could mute the sub completely . It has woken my dad up in the middle of the night even though I had it turned down as much as I could . For listening to music or movies , the simplicity of the Bose Companion 's can't be beat . These speakers are easy to setup , control , and sound great ! The ability to immediately mute from the puck has been invaluable . One last con : The Logitech Z-5500 's offer 500 + watts of power , 4 surrounds and a mid channel , and a 10 " subwoofer for nearly the same price as the Bose . The Klipsch Pro Media 's can be found for less than half the price of the Companions . Bose , you need to lower the price on these . * Addendum * Some reviewers have complained of " shrill " sounding drivers . You need to break your speakers in by playing them for about 12 hours after which they will be fine . Contrary to what another reviewer said , these speakers ARE magnetically shielded . The puck volume control has a slightly sticky base that can lose it 's stickiness over time . If this happens , use a damp / moist cloth and wipe the bottom of it . It will regain it 's stickiness . ;) Some reviewers have complained of " muddy " bass . It is not muddy at all . Like all subwoofers , room placement can be the key to whether or not you will receive good sound . You may also need to " break in " your speakers . The plugs can be pulled out quite easily on my system causing slight loss of sound from the satellites . The loss is so slight it may not be noticeable upon casual listening ( this happened to me ) . If you notice you are not getting clear stereo separation from the left and right , this may be the culprit .  
1	  Bought these to experiment with my Creative Zen ( which is excellent ) . Sound is tinny , lacking power , bass .. pretty much everything . Will return and purchase Altec Lansings like I should have done in the first place .  
2	  What can I say ? It 's Jack Bauer 's monocular .. Well , have on con , needed stay still to use it , and this is a little difficult to do , besides that , it 's great monocular .  
1	  I purchased the 50PF7320A / 37 50 " plasma tv from philips online store in Aug 2006 . Eight days after i received it the tv wouldn't power on and there was a flashing red LED on the front panel . I called philips to request a warranty repair . I was able to arrange repair with a local TV repair shop that services Philips warranty repairs . They came an picked it up . The problem was with one of the circuit boards in it . They were able to quickly indentify the problem and order a replacement part . The first part order took 2 weeks to even be delivered and then when the tv repair shop received it , it was DOA . The tv shop requested a replacement and then the part was on and is still to this day on back order with no ETA . The repair shop said it could possibly be months before the part was shipped in . So then i am furious i called philips to try to complain but they wouldn't even open a consumer complaint until the part was on back order for at least 1 month . So now i am having to wait over a month even after just having the tv for a week before i can even try to get my money back or a replacement tv . Then just as the 6 weeks had passed since it broke , the tv repair shop was able to use a part out of an existing working set just to get it back to me . Since i had been waiting so long . Now 3 days after receiving it back , the TV is acting up again , the same things it was doing , relays clicking on / off while set is off , before it stopped working altogether , are happening again . Found out that the part is still on back order . Appearently there is defective part that has not been fixed in these unit . Buyer beware , as if you purchase this set , it might work for a short time , and you will have it in the shop for more time then you can probably stand . Philips customer service is a joke , technical service is joke . This unit comes with a 1year warranty , and the additonal 2yr ext warranty costs over $ 700 . if you want to puchase this with a ext . just expect to pay the additional cost with the TV . In thinking back , if i would have know this was going to be such an ordeal . I would purchased a much better set from a better company and possilby even with a retail store such as best buy or someone who you can work directly with rather than going through philips directly . Just wanted to share my experience with this unit . One good note though . while its actually working , i am satisfied with the quality for the original sale price ( not including ext warranty ) . But if its going to break , then whats the point .  
1	  There is a major problem with the Zire 21 ( based on my own Zire 21 , admission of Palm tech support , and countless other reviews all over the web ) . The machine will randomly reset and lose all data and software that were on the machine . This makes it useless as a PDA . Look into another Palm product or one of its competitors .  
2	  These HAVE to be the best speakers for the price ! They have great bass , no subwoofer " farts " and spoken word is clean and crisp . If I knew they were this good I would have purchased two sets when Amazon had them on sale for USD $ 60 . Forget Bose , buy Altec Lansing !  
2	  I bought our DVD player from Target over a year ago and it is still doing great ! I really like the bracket that attaches it to the car seat . Seems very secure . Thinking about purchasing this same model for a second car . I have had great luck with it !  
1	  I had high hopes for this monitor after reading other reviews , but pulled it out of the box , plugged it in , and felt a pang of disappointment . Pixels are apparently missing in the screen , making small green dots appear on the desktop that can't be removed . I was also disappointed that the viewable screen was only 12 " wide and 9 " tall - not even close to the full 15 " as stated in earlier reviews . I 'll be returning the unit for a full refund . It 's unfortunate , because the monitor itself looks great on my desk .  
2	  I 'd have to agree with most of the reviews here . I just got my Expanium today , and I haven't stopped using it . If you make the CDs correctly , and buy your own headphones ( the included buds suck ) , then the advertised 10 hrs on 1 CD is a reality . The sound quality is great , although it doesn't get as loud as my discman , it still gets really loud . Slight problems : Poor included headphones ( c'mon , ear buds ? ) No ID3 tag support ( have to memorize what number is what album , but I write that on the CD anyway , so it 's not a big deal ) Poor LCD ( it was not designed to be looked head on , but if you look at it from an angle , it gets a lot better ) Cannot shuffle independent albums ( no big deal as long as you make CDs that are all one genre .. ) Takes a while to initaially read a CD ( not too bad though ) Slow to switch tracks ( even on an audio cd ) Expensive ( but it 's the best one out there , so I hear ) If you can live with those faults ( which I can ) , then this is one great MP3-CD player ..  
2	  Simply the best and easiest digital SLR camera I have used . I have just purchased one of these last week - an upgrade from the 300D - and I have to say that the speed and accuracy of the XTi is fantastic .  
1	  The quality of the copies that are produced is acceptable but not outstanding . My older Canon dedicated copier made better quality copies , and was faster . This may be the result of the compromise inherent in a multifunction machine compared to a machine that is dedicated to do one task . What is of concern is that this Brother began to make mechanical noises from its paper path when copying when it was less than 90 days old . On-site service is not covered under warranty . The local authorized service centers want $ 80 to $ 90 for on-site service , so the I had the machine taken to an authorized service center , where it is now waiting for parts . The machine will be out of service for at least one week . I am using a flat-bed scanner to do copying in the interim . I have a Brother fax machine which has been reliable , so the break-down of this machine is disappointing . I wonder if this machine will continue to be unreliable in the future . If I had to do it again , I would choose a Canon or HP .  
2	  First off , great life on batteries . Works on ' C ' so there were plenty of these at the store . Great sound , the bass is beautiful , the highs and mids are very legit for this very portable system . It has an mini-plug aux input so I had great sound playing DVD 's off my InLine portable DVD player and my laptop . This speaker system is a must if you need great sound without electricity . I work in the audio visual biz and I give this 5 stars easy .  
1	  It has not worked properly from day 1 . It is now taking over a month to get repaired . Buy any other MP3 player , or IPOD . Zune seems not to have it together  
1	  I use SD cards with both my camera and have been looking for a card reader which could handle SD and SDHC cards . This one was priced right and had good reviews . Unfortunately it apparently doesn't work with MicroSD cards that use the PNY CE Adapter . I tried on two different Windows machines ( XP and Win7 ) . When I plug the card in I get a dialog box that asks if I want to format the card . The card is already formated and contains photos . Sandisk MicroMate Reader - for SD and SDHC memory cards  
2	  Echoing most other reviews here , this is an excellent set of earphones that are well worth the money . But buying them is a risk ! If you don't wear these earphones correctly , they sound terrible , easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones . Those unsatisfied with the sound quality ( especially those complaining of lack of bass ) either haven't put them in correctly or have oddly shaped ears . Learning how to put them in properly takes time . Be prepared to spend a few hours fiddling with them and trying the different included cushions . Once you teach yourself how to put them in , it will only take a few seconds . Some tips : Before inserting the earbuds , draw the phones up from behind your ear , holding the earbuds in the correct orientation ( drivers pointing medially ) , so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals . With one hand , pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other . This straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone . ( Your doctor uses the same maneuver when he / she examines you with an otoscope . ) You may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better . If the phones are properly inserted , they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your Eustachian tubes ( that is , swallow ) , just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator . It may seem like it takes a lot of work ( and possibly learning a bit about anatomy ) to get these earphones to work as intended . It does , and success is not guaranteed . But it 's worth it ! And to save your hearing , don't forget to turn down the volume , since your music will no longer have to compete with outside noise .  
2	  I live in an apartment , so I knew from the start that I was going to be limited in the number of channels I could receive . My first antenna was a Phillips bunny ears , and it pulled in nothing . My dad got it for me for like $ 3 at a yard sale , so yeah I was expecting nothing there . My second antenna was a RadioShack Amplified Indoor Antenna , and I managed to get multiple stations , but only by constantly moving the ears and hoop , and standing next to it with my hand on the base . As soon as I would move away , it would cut out , and even adjusting the amplifier did nothing . I wasn't going to deal with that long-term , so I did research , found out about multi-directional antennas , and came across this particular one as well-rated and reasonably priced . After I received it , I set it up , pulled the ears up six inches , pushed the hoop until it was vertical , cut on the amplifier - and suddenly I 'm pulling in 4 stations ! The particular city where I live only has 3 stations that can be received with clear picture and sound without cable or satellite ( and 1 that is a snowy picture but decent sound ) , and I 'm so happy that this antenna pulled them all in with no problems . I definitely recommend this antenna if indoor is the only option , and price is a constraint .  
2	  I bought two 1750 's . I used the first in my office , then bought another for my wife . Both have worked without problems for at least two years . Indeed , I 'm in the midst of buying at least my third replacement cartridge for the more heavily used one . My wife uses Windows XP . I use XP for work , Ubuntu Linux for play , and all these systems support the 1750 . They rarely jam , and when they do they are easy to unjam .  
2	  Optoma HD73 720p DLP Home Theater Projectorthis projector and a good screen ( Da-Lite manual HDTV'92 ) are less than most + 50 inch LCDs . You will need a dark room . If you have a home computer with DVI-D out you can add a Blu-ray drive and plug it in to this projector for the best HDTV has to offer . Also , try a DIVCO Fusion RT 7 HDTV pci card for full HDTV .  
1	  well , it worked for just long enough to get past the warranty period , now it is stuck on the loading screen . This is way too common for this model ( do a google search ) Just stay away from nextar , many reports of failing nextar products on the web . : edit , I just thought I would add that after I spoke to Nextar CS they sent me a newer model as a replacement , even though I was beyond the warranty period . So far the new one has worked fine , so I thought it was worth it to update my review .  
2	  Work just as I hoped they would . Require some work to install but they look great and do the job well .  
2	  no question about the quality but i found the same item cheaper by $ 10.00 from buy . com  
2	  I bought this printer to replace a 5 year old All-in-One HP . I uninstalled the old driverts first even though the software didn't mention it , I knew it was a good idea . The install went good on 2 PC 's but hung on the MAC . The only problem is as a Network device , Some things don't work-I can not check the Ink level via the ToolBox . But can via Web I / F. HP tech was slow , I started telling him the answers to his statements to speed things up . I asked him if there was a known problem when using it over the network and he started to say No , then maybe , then yes after 30 minutes . Scanning s fine even on wireless computer , I just wish there support would give a straight answer the first time and stop wasting my time .  
1	  On the screen this case looks like it will work . However .. BE AWARE . I have a 1G and 2G and This case DOES NOT fit either of them correctly . The case is very very thin and does not fit snugly . It is very loose and almost falls off on it 's own . I would return it , but it will cost me almost as much in shipping as it did to purchase .  
1	  These worked fine until the ear clip broke off . The plastic that holds the clip to the swivel joint cracked and could not be fixed ( I tried some superglue but no luck . ) What a waste of money !  
1	  Purchased this memory as a standard mico SD memory card and as it turns it not that standard afterall . This memory does not work with my LGcu500 phone . Called the people at kingston and they are aware of a problem on their side only said their engineers are working on it . No estimated time of fix , no replacement memory , the only thing they could offer it to return the memory for a refund .  
1	  I bought these head phones because I read all the reviews that gave it 4 's and 5 's , so I expected a lot out of them . The truth is you really shouldn't .. they don't sound particularly awesome and I was rather disappointed that I actually spent close to $ 30.00 after shipping and stuff . The mid-highs and highs sound fine , but I had issues with bass and mid-low response , especially when I plugged it into my computer . Plus they are not super comfortable either ; the hinges nip at your neck when you don't have them on your head and they fit funny if you have glasses . All in all , I wished i had spent my money on something else . But they do look pretty cool .  
2	  I live in a college apartment complex where my roommate constantly bugs me , the guy upstair 's bed squeaks ( a terrible sound ) , and the guys downstairs play their bass LOUD . When I picked up the Koss " The Plug " earbud headphones , it turned my annoying college life around . Their great . It totally blocks out other noises ! I put these phones into my cd player , turn up the volume , and I can't hear a thing ! I can't hear my roommate knock on the door to ask for favors ( heheh ) , the bass downstairs is neutralized by the bass this plug emits , which is awesome . It took a while to fit in my ear , but I found it fits nicely when you let the end of the plug rest on the back of your ear . I highly reccomend these headphones . They fit nicely , have GREAT bass , and drown out everything outside . If I have any con , I 'd say that I 'm wary about the headphone life . It may not last very long seeing how fragile it looks . One of the tubes fell off on mine , but it 's not a problem . But these plugs are so cheap you can easily and cheaply get a new pair ! So buy it now !  
1	  Installed GCS1732 switch with one new HP pavillion p7-1010 usb mouse / keyboard windows 7 home premium and an older computer with XP service pack 3 , MSI mainboard and intel 2.4 ghz processor and ps2 keyboard / mouse . The result is a mouse that works very irratic with both systems . I have had to unplug the usb mouse from the switch and plug a mouse seperatly into each computer . Iogear Technical support seems to be non existant .  
1	  The remote and the receiver could not communicate . Waste of my return shipping cost .  
1	  I 've had these in my ears for under 10 minutes , and they 've already fallen out three or four times . I should mention that I am sitting in a chair and not moving . Sound quality is sub-par , although for $ 2 I wasn't expecting greatness ( and I 'm sure I would eventually get used to it ) . I was hoping to have these as a cheap backup , but they 're almost unusable . Try something else .  
2	  Love the idea that these ear buds can be stored easily in its winding case . They fit me perfectly and are very comfortable in the ear .  
1	  Amazon advertised a specific part number and sent a generic one that could not be used .  
1	  This is a great remote . Easy to use and program . I only give it one star because of the deceitful rebate programs offered by Logitech . I purchased this remote in Nov of 2006 and promptly submitted the rebate with all necessary UPC codes , receipts , etc . After an unusually long time , I checked on the status of the rebate only to find it was denied because Logitech claims I did not submit the UPC code from the box . This is absolutely false . Instructions were followed to the letter . Beware of rebates offered by Logitech . You won't get them .  
1	  Sound okay , until you turn on the " subwoofer " . The Bass sound cheap . the product is all around built cheap . feel cheap . Nothing good about this headphone beside the fact that it looks good . I would not recommend this headphone to anyone .  
2	  Perfect size and provide ample protection for the screen of my PSP 3000 . Not a touch screen so I 'm not handling it but still I would say I don't notice marks or smudges . I travel with my psp in a case so I can't vouch for the protection value if it 's got items rubbing up against it .  
2	  So far I have really enjoyed using this lens . I 'm still playing around with it and have a lot to learn but I 've been super happy with it so far  
2	  I would drone on and on , but there are many great reviews already posted . I bought this remote and replaced many older remotes with far fewer features . The most important feature of this remote is the signal is far more powerful than any remote I have ever owned . I am able to reach the equipment from bouncing off of walls without too much difficulty .  
2	  Works great ! Images are very sharp and the scanner is definitely travel size . Perfect for trips to the library for instance . Scans well enough to use in place of a desktop unit , if need be . Best feature is that it will scan legal size documents .  
1	  I bought the headset to be able to enjoy surround sound while playing my favorite game Americas Army on my Laptop . I got it to work ONCE ! It was awsome ! Great sound , I was able to tell exactly where shots or voices were coming from . Absoulutely great ! But after shutting the PC down and rebootig the next day , I couldn't get the same great sound anymore . It was all kind of .. well , just stereo ! Then I updated from AA 2.8.1 to 2.8.2Now I get all kind of echo , like in a basement . I reinstalled the driver , the software , even the game ! No change . I checked trough all the settings . Nothing wrong . I wrote 3 e-mails to the LTB customer service . Zero response , absolutely nothing ! And that is actually what gets me the most . If there is an incompatibility , I want to hear it from them ! That one day when the headset worked , it was great . But it is a little too expensive for just one day .. The microphone in the headset is not ideal . It is mounted too close to the speakers . It picks up sounds from the game and feeds them back into TeamSpeak , so all other players hear gunshots twice : once in the game , and with about a second delay on TS . It is possible to reduce that quite a bit , but I was not able to get rid of it completely .  
1	  I like the sound from it but it hurts my ears . It is bulky too . I would buy something else .  
2	  The Sony ICF-S79V Weather Band Shower Radio is everything its advertised to be and more . Worked perfectly after batteries installed , was / is easy to preprogram stations - even an AARP senior can do it , the sound is great with plenty of volume range . Portable so use it in main bath , the shower , and outside . Wonderful reception capability . Highly recommend it !  
1	  * Update on 4/24/07 * It 's now April , and this product still doesn't work after 4 months of email exchanges with Netgear technical support . It is taking themn 2 weeks to reply to an email ! I give them the information that they ask for , and they reply with gibberish and / or procedures that just doesn't work . It 's amazing ! I 'm keeping it going just for the entertainment value . * Original post from February .. I 've been disappointed with this router because of Netgear 's inconsistent technical support and poor instruction manual . I 'm pretty technically savvy about computers and electronics , and I 've never experienced this much trouble with a device . Buyer beware ! I 've been using the router with a Dell desk-top PC running Windows XP Home edition connected to Bellsouth DSL . ( I don't think this is too unusual a configuration . ) I wanted to be able to use my work laptop at home throughout the house without another hard-wired internet connection . When the Netgear router has worked , it has worked very well . But , getting it to work has been quite a chore . Following is my saga . Draw your own conclusions .. Problems began right out of the box . It promises quick and easy installation .. just insert a set-up CD with Netgear 's Smart Wizard , then follow the instructions , and in just a few minutes you should be up and running . This was not the case . At first , the wiz seemed to be progressing just fine , but then at a critical step , it just hung . I started over , taking extra care to ensure that I followed every instruction , but the same result . There was no documentation in the box to fall back on , so I had to call technical support . It took time to navigate through their technical support process .. you have to punch in a bunch of numbers and register the product . But , eventually , I got to a live human being , albeit someone obviously not American . This in and of itself is OK , but the accent made it very hard to understand them . Moreover , this person was not very helpful . After about 20 minutes , the router was still not working and no solution seemed likely anytime soon . I was frustrated . I ended up calling back later , and the second person was easier to understand and even better was exceptionally helpful . After about 20 more minutes , we got the router working . All was well for about 2 weeks . The router worked flawlessly . Other family members could use the desktop PC while I used my laptop . We could surf from both computers at the same time without any noticeable loss of speed . Just one minor nuisance in the form of a log in screen that popped up every time I turned on my desk-top computer . But , it really worked great . But , alas , one day the router just quit working for no apparent reason .. maybe a power outage .. I don't really know . I had to go back to technical support because the process for getting the router set-up is just not intuitive or logical . Without a working set-up CD or good documentation , you 're just on your own . And , I couldn't remember enough of how we did it the first time around to get it working again . So , as I say , back to technical support . This time around I made notes and printed out two key MS Explorer screens that were part of the set-up process . All was well for several months . Then , the router quit again about 3 weeks ago . So , I pulled out my notes and upon close inspection found that one of the Netgear screens that I printed out truncates the right side of the Explorer screen , and this included the last digits of the IP address which I had to know in order to get the unit working again . I was stuck . I tried downloading the manual for the unit from their web site . It 's the most unhelpful users manual that I 've ever read . The basic set-up part essentially says " Follow the Smart Wizard " which doesn't work . The advanced set-up part assumes one can get to the router 's set-up screen which I 'm unable to get to for some reason . Therefore , I had to go back to tech support . But , bummer ! I 'm now outside the free 90 days phone tech support window . So , I had to choose between paying $ 37 per 30 minutes of phone support or getting support via Netgear 's web site . I opted for the later . It 's been three weeks of back and forth across their site , and the router still doesn't work . They 've given me procedures to follow that simply don't work . Note that when I answer their questions or report what has happened when I try to follow their instructions , it typically takes 2 days to get a reply back . And now , two nights ago , someone new took over my " case " and informed me that the problem is that I 've never registered the device . Naturally , this is baloney . I had to register the router months ago to get tech support in the first place ! And , of course it 's really beside the point anyway . So , I 'm frustrated again and considering throwing the router in my electronics recycle bin and buying a new one . A user needs a step-by-step procedure for setting up a device like this . After all this time and effort , Netgear has been unable to provide this to me . Good luck !  
2	  I have tried alternative types of remote extenders including ones available at a popular electronic retailer . But this one is the only one I 've found that works as advertised ! I have it set up to control my HD Tivo box from a 2nd TV . It works great exactly as if it was in the room . I would highly recommend this for my type of situation or if you are looking to control your devices in a cabinet . I use the eye very close to the Tivo in my case but assume it would work if it was pointing towards multiple devices with a universal / harmony remote .  
1	  The unit that I ordered is completely useless . It reboots itself and must be reconfigured over and over throughout the course of the day . Netgear 's only solution was that I pay to ship the item back and wait 2 weeks for the exchange unit :-( , or to pay more for the item than it is worth to get a replacement in 2-3 days . Tech Support advised me that my router was defective . I would not only not buy this item , but I 'll never buy from Netgear again ! TRY ANOTHER BRAND ..  
1	  Yes it was conveient . But it broke within a matter of days . The keychain is cheap and so is the plastic the photo key chain is . Definitely would not recommend to anyone .  
2	  I wanted to link our BOSE WAVE RADIO to my IPOD TOUCH ( 2nd gen . ) and looked all over the Internet for a simple , inexpensive solution . No one could guarantee that the IPOD connector would fit a Touch G2 ( connector is somewhat different than the Touch G1 ) . Finally saw this cable system that links through the IPOD headphone jack instead of the IPOD connector . I decided to give it a try based on the good reviews . The product was shipped quickly , and I plugged it in and was enjoying beautiful music via the BOSE in less than a minute . The cables are sturdy and the connectors are great quality . It was quick and easy to connect , and the price was under ten bucks with free shipping . This is a real winner !  
1	  Please read the e-mail chat with customer support . They promote the range expander with specifications that are not accurate . They took me around 1 and half hour on the phone and couldn't find a solution , they accepted that they were wrong and anyway they didn't solve my problem with responsibility . I wouldn't reccomend to deal with linksys because then it willbe a headache if anything goes wrong . ( for reading porpuses I took out identifications and edited redundant text ) . Hi , my name is XX How may I help you ? Hi , i bought a range expander and I can't connect with my routerXX : Alright . Please confirm that you are using a WET54G . ( .. ) ok i have the Linksys Wireless-G Range Expander WRE54Gand i can't connect with the routerXX : So this is an initial set up for this wireless expander , right ? Miguel : yesXX : That 's alright . XX : Ok . What is the hardware version of it and what is the model number and version of your router ? after set up give me this error : " Can not associate with this ap in repeater mode " XX : So you are using a BEFW11S4V4 router . Let me verify some information . Also , what is teh exact version of the WRE54G ? Miguel : where i lookthat ? XX : You may check that underneath the device itself . There 's a word LINKSYS , down below there 's a model number and version . XX : Ok . There 's a serial number and MAC address and model number with version . Anabelle G ( 14455 ) : Alright . But it does not show any version like WRE54GV2 ? I can't find the version , only show wre54gXX : Then if there 's no any version , then it 's a version 1 wireless expander . XX : Ok . the Wireless Expander you have will not work with a BEFW11S4V4 router . This BEFW11S4V4 router will only work with a WRE54GV2 . Miguel : oh nooXX : Otherwise , you can return the WRE54G and look for WRE54GV2 . XX : I mean ask for a verison 2 for WRE54G . but in the information that you have in the sites said that work with 802.11b StandardXX : Alright . Lety me verify some information . Please hold on . The problem is that I 'm in another country Anabelle G ( 14455 ) : I see . XX : Hold on for a few moments while AI verify this information . Standards : IEE 802.11b , IEE 802.11gButtons : Autoconfiguration , ResetLEDs : Blue / Red-LINK , Blue-ACTIVITY ( .. ) XX : Wait , i 'll check on it . XX : As I have verified again with my higher technical support that this router will only work with a WRE54Gv2 as it 's tested already . So what I can suggest you here is to ask for a replacement into V2 . You may contact them or email the retailer where you buy purchased this WRE54G.XX : the problem is that i 'm in another county , not in the statesXX : I understand that . Where did you buy this WRE54G ? and i bought this product because the data sheet say that work with Bin one of internetXX : If the WRE54G is V2 but since the device itself is a V1 , then this will not work on it . XX : And what retailer is that . XX : this will work with a G router . Let me double check on it . the funny think is that I bought Linksys to don ` t have compatibility problemsXX : Thank you for waiting . The router that will work on this WRE54Gv1 is the WRT54G with all versions and WRT54GSV1 but it still depends on teh firmware of the router . please tell me what to do because i want that it workXX : But all routers now has the updated firmware already that will work on the WRE54Gv1 . XX : Alright . If you do not want to return this WRE54G to the retailer where you purchsed it , you have the option to switch router into G router ( WRT54G or WRT54GS ) , then that 's the suggestions I can gave you . Is your problem too and the information sheet say that is compatible with BXX : I apologize for the inconvenience this may cause by the data sheet . Yes that Linksys have inhis siteXX : Alright . And again , I apologize for the inconvenience . what is the price that linksys can give me the router ? because you haveto understund that im in other country and change the expanger is not so easy like in the statesXX : For that information , I do not have it since were more on technical concerns . If you want you may contact Linksys Customer Service so you can verify with them how much this Wireless G router so you can buy a new router . XX : Yes , I understand that it 's far from the United States .  
2	  I just got my iRiver ChromeX iMP-150 CD / MP3 Player and so far i am completely satisfied with it . you may have read that some people have concerns regarding the loose top but i can assure you that this is NOT an issue . it does jiggle a little though but doesn't appear to come loose . this cd player comes with a slick blue design , remote , and earbuds . unfortunately i think that this is the worst part of this product . while the cd player itself is excellent and plays several of my scratched cds flawlessly that other cd players cannot read , i find myself wondering what the heck the company was thinking by not including a power supply ? but if you were lucky enough to have purchased a rio volt or something u can use their power supply . hehe .. i do that .. no problem but back to the issue . no power supply , earbuds aren't the best [ i use sony ! ] , and remote looks cheap . luckily for them , they made a quality cd player easily affordable to any broke a $ college student like me wanting one . :P  
2	  I have had the Stealth reporter D400 AW for about a year . Extremely well made and needed another bag . I find the 550 as well made and useful as to 400 . This bag easily handels a Canon 100-400 ' L ' series , 70-200mm ' L ' series plus a number of other lenses and a 40D with battery pack . This is a very rugged equipment bag . It 's not a bag to load and carry around all day however . Oh the bags great . But once loaded with quality gear .. it 's HEAVY . For just smaller lenses and camera body , I 'd recommend the Lowepro Slingshot . Very handy and easily carries stuff for a day trip . But the Slingshot won't easily carry the larger ' L ' series lenses . The Stealth Reporter line is highly reommended for Pro 's and semi-pros for getting equipment to and from a shoot .  
1	  NORMAL TYPING : Thankyou fr readig this review . this is nta tpo , thissanaccurat depictionof ow responsie the keysare onthe keyboard . HERE IS THE TRANSLATION : Thank you for reading this review . This is not a typo , this is an accurate depiction of how responsive the keys are on the keyboard . That second paragraph , and all the rest of this review , were extremely difficult . Making sure you are getting the letters you want to actually type out is much more difficult then it should be . The problem seems to be the sensor inside each key is just too small for he size of the key itself . I press a key and feel like it has accepted the letter , but the silicon contoured around the sensor and doesn't actually trigger the sensor . I feel this keyboard is going to train me to type as if I am texting on a cell phone - everything in shorthand . Not what I intended . Save yourself the headache and buy a more expensive one . And honestly now my finger tips are sore from pounding on this keyboard . So disappointed , Brady  
2	  The BEST sound quality by far compared to all MP3 players I tested out recently on my visit to BBY . The FM radio reception is crisp and clear - great for tuning into those TV-Radio transmissions in a Gym . The most suprising feature was the voice recording - you can truly get a very clear professional quality sound recording at the touch of a button . My friends who are musicians use my player to critique their practices ! I have recorded and downloaded songs from the inbuilt FM radio and they are truly of outstanding quality . And then there is the line in recording feature . It sounds complex but it is really simple . Just use the supplied cord and convert all CD , LP , tape collection you have into MP3 . The price of course is much better than any other premuim player on the market . Do not confuse this with cheap imports that are marketed under big company names .  
2	  This plug strip was a great addition to our travel electronics on a recent European trip . The cord is short and the unit compact so that it took up little room . Combined with the appropriate plug adaptor we we able to charge three item from one wall outlet . With the number of electronic devises we all carry ; phone , iPod , camera , computer , etc , finding a simple charging solution is a challenge . This product is a great solution . Note as stated the cord is short so the unit is compact , this was not a problem .  
1	  Bought this player just over 3 months ago and it started having problems where the screen wouldn't come on , but we were always able to get it going so we just assumed that it was a little buggy . Then about two weeks after the measly 90 day warranty went out the screen went with it . The screen doesn't come on at all now and when we called the support line they told us quite nicely that we were screwed and would have to buy another unit . Rest assured it will not be a Polaroid . So if you have * ANY * problems with this unit , return it and ask for another one before it is too late . Other than the screen going out I would not recommend this player for the following reasons : You cannot change the Discs when you have it turned around to put in a car carrying case . In order to change the discs you must remove the power cable and remove the player from the case and open it up .. then close it back , return it to the case and re-attach the power cable . Tedious . Plus this unit has no battery memory . When it loses power ( such as when you turn the car off to pump gas ) , it loses it 's spot in the movie . The only way to get to the player 's setup menu is via the remote , so don't lose it if you are unfortunate enough to have purchased this unit . The games are the equivalent of poorly done Atari 2600 games , and although they tell you that there are a bunch of games there are really only about 3 different kinds . Those 3 are just repeated over and over and over again with slightly different graphics .  
2	  Apple is quite simply the best and most innovative computer manufacturer . Their various Macintosh computers are very user-friendly : easy to set up and use and ( unlike most PCs ) seldom crash or malfunction . Furthermore , the new iMac computers , although full-featured , are very compact and , thus , take up little desk space . The new iMacs all have adjustable flat-panel displays with exceptionally bright , sharp images . Now Apple has increased the processor speeds of these strikingly-attractive new iMacs and reduced their prices . This model has a big 20 " wide screen display plus a 1.25 GHz G4 processor . Please don't be put off by the fact that the processor clock-speed is " only " 1.25 GHz . The G4 processor accomplishes more than twice as much per clock cycle as Pentium 4s do and , thus , is faster than a 2.5 GHz Pentium 4 . All things considered , this new iMac is a terrific , versatile wide screen computer at a reasonable price . Highly recommended .  
2	  This filter was for the Nikon 24-70 F2.8 zoom lens . I have seen some reflections in the lens from cheap filters on my other lenses , so not this time . The multi-coating and such seems to do what they say , so no ghosting / reflection or other type problems seen so far .  
1	  Hardware is great . A wonderful little device . The software is next to useless . It simply does not work , and their technical support has not EVER respond to my attempts to contact them . A shame , but unless they actually make software that works , I would have to say avoid buying from them . I have not been able to update the music on the internal memory for months due to the freezing , crashing and very low quality of their code .  
2	  Great Cable , gets the job done . Cheap too . As good as an other more expensive brand out there .  
1	  The only virtue of this lens is the zoom range . Chromatic abberation , highly abnormal distortion , and slow aperture above 17mm make this a bad value . The new Canon 18-55 IS is much better optically . Even better , go for the Tamron 17-50 f / 2.8 or the Canon 17-40L for a bit more . This is the worst lens I have ever used without a doubt . Check photozone . de for detailed comparisons of the lenses and save yourself some money and get quality instead !  
2	  This case is very well suited for my external HD . It is resistent , does not deform and , besides , it is very discret and beautiful .  
2	  We love the sound . and you are the best , fast service and delivery tks i will give you a # 10  
2	  Well made - very rugged - lots of room . What can I say - Pelican makes as great product . I will buy more of these . EDIT 10-23-2012I bought another of these for mics and stuff . Love this case !  
1	  This item works fine as a small portable radio but myself and many others who bought this item found that the flash memory was defective . Unfortunately the store I bought it from will no longer accept it for return and Cowon 's tech support is non-existant . I would recommend you shop for a different audio player .  
1	  from the first moment that installs the video card in my computer this I do not present / display image . I believe that this product can that it does not fulfill the espectativas of many people , in my place cannot prove it so that I never work myself  
1	  This radar detector gave me false alarms for laser when I was driving toward the sun . It is very bad early in the morning or in the evening as the sun is near the horizon . I returned it and got a replacement .. same problem . False laser alarms which are very annoying . I also have the V995 . This is a much better model . I don't get nearly as many false alarms ( laser or radar ) with this model . In addition , you can turn X band off ( I haven't seen a cop use x band in 10 years ) on the V995 while still leaving it set to highway . Thus you get the best detection ability with minimum false alarms .  
2	  This case is compact and stores my player and cords very nicely . For what I use it for it is great . I would buy another if I needed to .  
2	  I bought this set long time ago , october 2007 , and I gotta say I 'm very pleased with this tv still today . It 's very difficult to go wrong with Sony . HDTV images are great for the price .  
2	  Easy to get going right out of the box , much less expensive than one I bought a few years ago at $ 30 .. My 4 year old son can connect this up and disconnect from video games ( colored cables to colored inputs )  
1	  This is a redundancy purchase . Amazon was cheating on the " Frequently Bough Together " advertising . The Antenna came with a mount kit .  
2	  Instant 1600 points with no tax , much better deal then going through the marketplace . I will buy all my points from here if the prices stay the same .  
2	  This lens is hard to review since it does have some significant weaknessnes so let me get those issues out of the way : 1 ) Not a good low light performer . Don't think you are going to set this up in a low lit room and a tripod and get the AF to cooperate unless you provide additional light . You will have to manual focus . 2 ) No AF limiter , which wouldn't be a problem if 1 ) wasn't a problem . Ok , bad news out of the way , lets go over the good news : 1 ) This lens is TACK SHARP . You won't find a sharper lens . This thing could resolve out to 200mp is my guess , but we won't know about that given the current state of sensors . 2 ) With well lit situations this lens is an AWESOME macro AND portrait lens . So the dilemna is how much to punish it for the low light performance . In my view , not much and here 's why : For what this lens does well you are not going to find a lens that does better . This lens max 's out the categories it does well in ( sharpness , color , contrast ) when properly lit so I 'm going to give it 5 stars . To do otherwise would be like taking points off the Canon 300mm 2.8 because it didn't take decent picures in the house at the last birthday party . One lens cannot be all things to all people .  
2	  This little card is great . My wife and I can now download pictures to our laptop or desktop with digging out a card reader . What a great idea . It feels delicate , but it has held up fine .  
1	  I recently upgraded my home theater system and was looking for a moderately priced 12 gauge wire to connect the speakers . After reading reviews and descriptions on just about every package of wire sold on Amazon I chose this based on the price , reviews and the fact it was sold in a 25 foot package . It arrived yesterday and is being returned today . The picture shows what appears to be a blue tinted clear wire . That 's not what is on the spool I received . What I got is a thick , dark blue wire that resembles a utility / industrial electrical cord . There is nothing clear or tinted about it . The actual wires are encased in an outer shielding that is a thick , opaque rubber , making the overall product closer in size to an 8 or 10 gauge . It is completely inappropriate for an exposed wiring application . It should be sold as for use ' in wall ' or concealed . I 'm sure the sound would be awesome if I were to have wired my system with this cable . But there is no way I can string and conceal this cable around my room .  
1	  Low quality pictures , lots of red eye and .. the worst problem a digital camera can have .. a LOONG delay when you depress the shoot button .  
1	  Have had this DVD player for about three years . It stopped playing in the middle of a movie last night . It wouldn't play so I thought maybe the disc was dirty . H07 kept appearing in the display . I have since found out that HO7 isn't a good thing . It 's really disappointing to buy something that last only three years . I will not buy another Panasonic even if they make the best one on the market .  
2	  The ipod nano is great for music ! I take it every where . You can even play games on it will you are lisening to music ! I would reccomend this mp3 player !  
1	  My old cassette adapter started having intermittent problems so I started looking for a new one . I figured I 'd try this cheap adapter because the model in the local store was $ 20 which seemed to high . I received it today and the quality is terrible . There is a lot of noise , and the frequency response does not allow for any highs . SO I plugged in my old one , just for comparison , and it 's like night and day . Looking at the cassette I can see that my old one had a much larger head than the new one . That 's probably the problem . DO yourself a favor and spend the extra $ 10 for a decent adapter .  
1	  I was given this as a Christmas present . The idea behind it is great . I used it with my Averatec tablet . Soon after using it , the battery life dropped to about half . I purchased a tip for my phone . First time I used it , the charging was done in 10 minutes . The battery now only gets 3 days where I was getting 5 . I replaced the battery and still get the same 3 days . I 've sent emails asking about tips for other items and have not received a single response . In addition , I sent an email asking about the problems I had after using the device , again , no response . Use at your own risk .  
2	  I had a Sony S75 for three years . That camera took excellent pictures , but as my children grew from babies into fast-moving toddlers and preschoolers , the S75 's two-second shutter lag started to become a problem . Sure , I could pre-meter a shot by holding the shutter button halfway down , but in the two seconds it took for the camera to auto-focus and get the right exposure settings , my subject had already moved-usually several feet toward the camera with little hands outstretched . So I spent tons of time looking for something fast . That was really my primary criterion . Size was also a factor , and unfortunately that ruled out more capable cameras with large lenses and lots of manual settings . The W50 is fast . Its lens extends and it 's ready to shoot within about a second after turning it on . In decent light , it takes the picture when you push the shutter button .. none of that sitting around thinking while the subject toddles away . Now , I was a bit disappointed that Sony discontinued the DSC-P200 . But the feature set of the W50 is quite similar . There are a few things that I wish the W50 had in common with the P200 : the P200 has a metal body , while the W50 's body is plastic . The P200 uses standard Sony Memory Sticks , while the W50 uses the harder-to-find Memory Stick Duo . Also , the P200 is 7 megapixels , although the difference between 6 and 7 megapixels is beyond my untrained eye . The 2.5-inch LCD is nice . I never felt that such a large LCD was necessary to take pictures , but it 's nice for showing pictures to others ; it 's like showing people pictures in your wallet . The camera , like all modern digitals , contains a clock that keeps the current time and date . Prior Sony models displayed the time on the splash page when the camera booted up . The W50 just says " Cyber-shot " and then goes about its business . This is a small detail , but I don't usually wear a watch , and it was nice to be able to quickly check the time by turning on my camera . Sony , what gives ? :) The camera comes with some software . Usually I wouldn't bother with software included with a camera ; the camera is recognized by modern operating systems as a mass storage device , so you can just hook it up and drag pictures to your My Pictures folder , or whatever . But the Cyber-shot viewer that comes with the W50 is worth a look . It organizes pictures with a calendar that zooms in and out as you select things . It 's a great way to look at pictures , a lot of fun . Overall , I 'm quite pleased with the little W50 . If your favorite photographic subjects are small children , the W50 will be up to the challenge of matching their pace . And the image quality is more than acceptable for 4x6 prints .  
2	  you will not be dissapointed after purchasing this camera ! it has a nice big display screen . sleek new style and color . picture clarity is awesome . i got a sim card for it and i 'm able to take a video 30 min long if i want to . you can play back with sound ( i had to upload my videos to the computer before i could watch my videos with sound on my HP ) you can also save pictures that were already taken with differnt features , i.e. black and white and sephia , without damaging the original picture . not to mention the cause that the purchase of this camera supports . like i said , this camera does not dissapoint !  
2	  Pro's - Awesome build quality - Very geeky looking - Best comfort for your palm - Fingers wouldn't ache even after prolonged use - Awesome packing by AmazonNot really Con 's but - Good things take time to learn and adapt . This product will test your patience , that is , the ability to scroll around , select certain cells in excel sheet , or perform right-click , etc , will take time to learn . But it is the best option if you are a mouse guy with computers .  
2	  Few month ago I asked a fellow motorcycle rider about a bag he was carrying - he said timbuk2 . He liked it a lot , however , he said , his was too big and the laptop was kinda all over the place . So I paid a little extra and got the one that was made to carry a laptop . Since I work in downtown , I ethier ride my motorcycle or Bart ( train ) . This bag is great for either - it 's easy on / off and stays with you at 80 MPH + . The space is adequate for your laptop , gym gear and a water bottle , however I wouldn't call this bag large - it 's just the right size . If you are on the go and want something that looks good within a $ 100 budget - Get It - that 's my verdict .  
2	  Excellent product . I researched many brands and models before I decided onthis one , and I 'm glad I did . It was exactly what my husband wanted . It made the perfect gift . I received it quickly and the price I paidon Amazon was unbeatable .  
1	  I just want to have a recorder to copy the music teacher 's assignment . And , this recorder does the job fine . The rewind button quit jump up on the first day I get this thing . I still keep it because I need one to do copy and I am too lazy to return it .  
1	  I bought the camera three weeks ago and it was fine , i know have a problem with it , it comes on but will not do anything . it acts like a computer that has locked up , after 9 calls later someone finally called me back from vivitar and explained to me that they could fix it for $ 80 . ? . ? i asked about the warranty and they continued with the plastic case was under warranty .. Help  
1	  I have HP Officejet AIO J4580 at home . At the shop I was told it works wirelessly with MAC . HAHA . It doesn't . I do live in a country where sales people 's knowledge of the product is : " oh its very nice for you " , so I should have known better . After some emailing with HP support they advised me to buy the " Wireless printing upgrade kit " to make it work wirelessly , and I did mention I have a MAC . HA HA HA ! It doesn't . The world seems to be full of sales people who 'll tell you any lie just to make a sale . Well HP , my fancy AIO printer is on it 's way to bin , followed by the useless upgrade kit . What a waste of time and money . I 'll be waiting for Apple to come up with a very thin AIO MACBOOK that wirelessly prints , scans , faxes and whips up a cappucino while I get ready to spend some quality time at home . Anything else is just not worth the effort . MAC for president !  
1	  This device simply doesn't work properly . I purchased one , dealt with Cisco support , updated the firmware , etc . , but still wound up returning it three days later . I bought it to interoperate with my Linksys WRT54G . I used the 11 mb WET11G for years and it was great . But the WET54G would run great for a few hours , and then it would slowly deteriorate . If I left it on overnight - which I always do - by the morning it would be barely working . A reboot would fix it , but then it would start the process again . I would literally need to boot it two or three times a day . A complete waste of time and shipping expense .  
1	  I 'm giving one star for this product because it was doing very well until it 's LCD screan broke with only two years , and with not that much of a usage . I got very disappointed with this product because when I bought a Camera it was to use it for about five years . The LCD screan stopped working in a sudden while I was downloading videos to my computer . I tried to call the customer support and they told me the only thing they can do is to fix it with the cost of 175 dollars plus shipping . I guess I might as well buy another one from a different brand , because I won't be risking another disappontment .  
2	  The tripod is really well made , extremely good quality . There is nothing much to say about it . Very light . Worth the price .  
1	  Do not get this , it got stuck in my new macbook pro .. and the combination was correct ! Would not come out . Look elsewear .  
1	  They are now sending my producted . to my home address . They never commuicated with there customers . My phone number is posted on my account information .  
2	  I had a set of these wireless phone jacks connecting my TV to the phone line without having to do a lot of rewiring in the house . They worked great for 10 years . I expect to get another 10 years of service out of my new set .  
1	  August 7 , 2009 - UPDATEI have printed several pages since my first review and I am happy to report that the prints using the black inks have looked much better . At the quality that I am receiving now , I would purchase these cartridges again . I have used the cyan and yellow inks as well and have not had a problem with them . = I received these in the mail . They were individually wrapped GENERIC cartridges . So were the colored ones that I ordered from the same company . This is not what is pictured . I opened one up today and the ink leaked all over my hands ( Perhaps I squeezed it when I took off the plastic piece ) . Anyway , I cleaned the cartridge up and placed it in my printer . ( I made sure it was no longer leaking first . ) The print quality is not nearly as good as the original . I am definitely disappointed in my purchase .  
1	  I was a HP printer fan until I purchased the 7140xi . I purchased it because it came with a print server & networking capabilities for my home LAN . After 40-50 hours on the phone with HP Support ; calling friends for technical support , weeks of frustration , and many installs / uninstalls later-the HP printer is being returned . I could not get the HP software to install on my desktop with Windows XP-Home . I was able to install the HP Director software on 1 Windows 2000 laptop but not on another W2K laptop . My advice : consider another multifunction . I just ordered a Canon Multipass 730 & have given up on a networked multifunction for my home LAN .  
1	  This gets less than one star from me . I now know the difference between a good HDMI cable and a cheap useless one . After attaching the HDMI to my BluRay player , I started getting delays and gaps in the video . I thought it may have been the disc but I switched with my cable box and then the cable picture experienced the same delays and gaps . I dumped the cheap HDMI and purchased a flat HDMI higher quality cable from a big box store in Vegas and both the picture and audio work great now . Price does make a difference with HDMI and electronics . I will rely on the gold HDMI cable from now on . I did not think there was much difference in HDMI cables , but I found out there are huge differences in the quality that effects all electronic devices .  
2	  To echo what is said about the new release SIGMA lenses - WOW . Canon look out . I was shopping for a new toy for XMAS and settled on the CANON 14mm F2.8L lens . It was very nice but for the price hard to justify . I asked for an eval of the Canon and this , the Sigma alternative at 1/3rd the price . Head to head testing of the lenses on my Canon EOS 50 ( ELAN ) using ISO 200 film resulted in the Sigma producing a crisper image with better definition and colour saturation . Both lenses have a little " flattening " of the image at the edges as they try to compensate for curvature but the Sigma in my opinion is closer to true . Neither lens had any trouble Auto-Focusing during the day ( Canon felt a little faster ) . The Sigma was a little unsure of itself on when I went for a night / bulb exposure of the starscape . Switched to Manual , set for infinity and away we went . My only other issue with the Sigma is the lens hood is not quite big enough where the Canon is spot on . Still you have to be looking really hard for faults to find them . Tooling around with the lens has been lots of fun . I had never considered using the lens for indoors shots but it is magic . Architecture photography is going to be a new thing for me I think .  
2	  When I purchased these 3 years ago , I thought I was in heaven . Amazing upgrade from my 2.0 yamaka speakers , amazing bass , amazing how they would never distort , even more amazing once i got digital working .. and then I heard a full blown home theater system which showed me exactly what the z-680 's really are - popcans . No midrange , boomy bass , actually it doesnt even deserve the title of " boomy " because it simply doesnt put out a whole lot of bass without distorting and creating generally muddy sound , not to mention the lack of extension . It 's alright bass for quiet music , but then why have a sub if it sucks for a movie even in a small room ? Sure this doesn't cost an arm and a leg , but save up $ 600 to spend , and you can get components off ebay that will make you throw this kids toy set to the back of your closet .  
2	  These sound great , and are extremely comfortable . Sound doesn't get way too loud even at max volume . Clear sound , lightweight and great price .  
1	  I bought this amp for my husband . He took it to a shop to have it installed . The guy told him this was not a good brand . I don't know much about these things but I do know that his system does not sound like it use to .  
2	  I 've used these before . I prefer to hardwire my radar detectors . I can't stand the coiled cord hanging down the dash for the cigarrette lighter . This a cheap solution .  
2	  This does exactly what I want it to do . It 's nice to have a few pictures on it , but I didn't really care about that capability . However , it 's a great MP3 player , has more than enough room for my music and audio books , I love the radio function , and the recorder is very , very useful to me as a college student . It may be bulkier than some of the others , but it also seems pretty solid and well built . I did by better headphones ( I need really small earbuds ) but I expected this . I really love this thing .  
1	  This product suppose to be a sport gadget and there for I use it only in the gym and put it with all my stuff in my bag . I don't know why but one time , after 10 times of use when I just open them it broke in the joint with no reasonable reason . So be ready It have a good voice but It will break no matter what you do .  
1	  Something must have gone wrong that day my Lyra came out of the factory . Great accessory , the FM transmitter i mean . But as of the rest ? Well 3 weeks into it and i had to format it with all my songs in it . First it started with mixing the songs up . Out of the blue while listening to a song suddenly it would play a different tune just for a few seconds and then return playing the first one . Afterwards it got worse it would say " file not found " , get stuck or it wouldn't even start up . Needless to say i consider this as a piece of " great idea gone wrong .. " to put it MILD ..  
2	  About 8 years ago I bought a similar pair of astronomical binoculars from Celestron - the 15x70 model . I must say after comparing the old 15x70 with the new 20x80 I 'm not too impressed . On the plus side ( and this is a significant plus ) the mounting / support bar on the 20x80 model is much better than the mounting solution for the 15x70 . It 's far more stable and resistant to wobble , which is really important for good viewing . On the down side , the optics of the new 20x80 seem to be of lesser quality . There 's seems to be more flaring and greater difficultly getting a very clean and sharp image . If I had to choose one pair based solely on image quality , I 'd stick with my old 70 's . When looking for deep sky objects , I think you can see some marginal benefit as the 80 's gather more light but it 's minor . Still , when you consider how inexpensive these are , I find it hard to complain . One can hardly expect stellar optics when you consider the cost . This is a product that offers a lot of bang for the buck so be realistic about your expectations . On that score , these are winners .  
1	  The cradle for the PDA works just fine as it should being a rather generic and simple design . However , being that the mount is simply plugged into the lighter socket makes it a rather poor design because the mounting arm is long and not stable . It is an accident waiting to happen in terms of knocking the mount over or damaging the lighter socket . Forget this mount and get something more practical and durable ; suction cup , vent , or dash mount .  
2	  I was worried by some of the negative reviews of this receiver until I used it . Peoples biggest concern seems to be that the casing is platic instead of metal .. sure it would feel nicer in your hand but is really not important . So far as lockups go , Im guessing that there was user error in the firmware update or the installation . I have 3 car kits , multiple MicroSD cards and have had NO issues . The ability to hear a song on the radio , record it , and merge it with your MP3s is effortless . It does everything its supposed to do very well and for a lot le $ than any other player . The sure connect system works well but you still have to make sure the channel selected doesnt have anything being broadcast on it or you will hear static . My reasons for not giving it five stars : Monochrome screen , screen rotation does not allow you position the unit horizontally in either direction , plastic case . Its a great unit , and for less than $ 50 you cant go wrong .  
1	  I 've had a pair of these Sony headphones for several years , and to put it bluntly .. they suck ! I do NOT recommend purchasing them because a . ) the sound is lacking in quality , especially the bass reproduction , b . ) with the exception of ' ear buds ' I 've tried , these are the most uncomfortable headphones I 've ever worn . I would give these phones two , maybe three stars max , but I feel my review should offset the other reviews . The bottom line is : Save your money , and go with better headphones .  
2	  I 've had my FinePix 4900 for half a year now and I 'll be keeping it a lot longer ! [ Now I 've had it for nearly seven years , .. still works fine , still delivers ! ] It is the first digital that I 've bought , and I specifically chose one with full exposure control to use in photographing small zoological specimens . I also have the wide angle lens adapter and a set of close-up lenses , plus a few filters . It performs its intended function very well : I use it to record scientific images of a kind of marine snail known as a cowry . The aperture control allows improved depth of field in the close-up work that I do . This is a well-executed design . I like the ' feel ' of its grip-type right side . The optics seem to be everything that they should and the wide angle lens seems to be about the equivalent of a 28mm on a 35mm camera . ( The lens-to-extender threading can be difficult to put together , so be careful ! Fortunately , the extender itself threads onto the camera body much more readily . ) Bearing in mind that I rated the Fuji FinePix 4900 at five stars , let me pick a nit : the lens cap needed further thought ! Clearly " designed " to be attached at the left side of the camera , it should have had a clip on it to attach it to the neck strap when it was not on the lens . It is very difficult to control this cap unless it is on the right side of the camera , where you can grip it by its lanyard with the hand that you 're going to keep on the camera . I have yet to employ all of this camera 's features but those that I have used work as they should . Photographers can work with this quality item !  
2	  work great my son love da item and the price it really good , the effect work very great Excelent purchase  
2	  I GOT THIS KILLER SYSTEM FROM PANASONIC AND IT TOTLLY ROCKS EXCELLENT SOUND AND EXCELLENT RECORDING AND WORTH EVEY PENNYTHIS IS ALL YOU NEED TO ROCK THE HOUSE PANASONIC MADE KILLER LITTLE SYSTEM THAT KRANK 'S ..  
2	  I brought this for my cable box that is behind the LCD above the fireplace . It worked like it promised . Just recharge the batteries for 24 hours before installation . Put the RF battery in your remote , plug this baby up and you 're in business . I could change the channel from my son 's room upstairs . My wife was impressed . Saved me $ 300.00 by not hiring a professional . Buy it you won't be sorry .  
2	  I live in a 3 story condo and I was having problems with my wi-fi . Problem fixed and my wi-fi is even faster now . It 's not as big as people say it is .  
1	  I might have been one of the first people to ever purchase the Jaz Drive they sold years ago when it came out . I didn't have a good experience with that even though it was suppose to be the high end of their product line . But I still gave their Zip drives a chance because of how highly so many people have raved about their convience . So when I eventually purchased one I had problems with their Zip drives too . I believe it has been more than just bad luck . I suggestion if anyone wants mass storage they should get Compact Flash ( CF ) cards to use . These are solid state memory ( meaning no moving parts ) and much more durable and reliable then anything on the market at this time . They do cost more but these things are well worth it becuase if you travel around with a notebook computer like me you 'll also see how little battery power CF cards drain your battery . If you choose this option the only other thing you need to get with your CF card is a USB CF card reader ( which aren't expensive at all ) and if you like to really save the power on your laptop you might want to also get a PC card adapter for your new CF card like myself . Then there is also the ability for you to use your CF card on other things like PDA 's , Digital Cameras , etc . So you don't have to feel you have spent all this money and also limited yourself to only one use for it .  
2	  These headphones are EASILY the best I have ever owned . The sound quality of these cans is amazing considering the price . The comfort however , not so much , 4 stars because of the pressure the earpads put on your ears . I fixed this by taping my old Gamecom 367 Pads onto these ( Laugh all you will it still feels AWESOME ) , it even slightly enhanced the acoustics of the cans .  
2	  First one had a power supply problem . Amazon replaced it very fast . All in all a great unit .  
2	  The canon deluxe photo backpack 200EG is what I was looking for my new canon xsi . The movable compartments are good for organizing the extra lens I have which is a 55-250 lens . As well as lens covers , wipes , ect .. I still have room for more lenses . I have added extra elastic straps with velcro to help hold my camera in place . The interior see through compartments are good for cords , extra battery & charger as well as other items that I might need . The 1st outer compartment I use for my user manual and other paperwork . The 2nd outer compartment is empty for now , but I put snacks in it . The padded shoulder straps and back make it comfortable for bike riding . The cross body strap also helps to keep the pack from shifting side to side when riding a bike .  
2	  I recently bought this item . The GPS functions are great but take a little getting used to . Your can plan a trip and the PIN 570 will tell you where to turn and quite cleaverly if you decide to take a different rout it will re compute the rest of the journey after warning that you have deviated from planned rout . It can be set to avoid toll roads and for varous ather settings . As well as GPS devive its a regular PDA with adress , phone numbers , games and other utilities that run under Winsows Mobile .  
2	  Sennheiser Rs110 926 Mhz Wireless Rf HeadphonesGood product . Sound is clear and handles outside interference well . One notable fault is that it is hard on standard AA batteries and suggest that rechargeable batteries be used with a spare set on hand at all times .  
2	  After Listening to all the logitech and Insignia ( and my own logitech ) units at Best Buy I came to this klipsch unit was BLOWN AWAY . THX certified for a reason I guess .. its just an orer of magnitude better than all the others . All of the other units had a hole in the midbass and no real low bass . These do a geat job of filling in the mid bass so voices sound warm clear and real . I prefer bass reflex over ported units but this one is quite good . The highs sparkle , the bass is real and I could not be happier .  
1	  I guess I was over excited from the reviews of great sound quality . I bought these mainly for studying as an alternative to putting ear buds in my ears every day . Pros : very comfortablelong cord for mobility around roomabsolutely amazing ear pads ( although it 's almost impossible to wear these backward , not that you 'd ever want to ) Cons : maybe I received an odd pair as almost every other review has these having great sound quality , but when I listened to multiple songs ( hip hop , pop , electric / techno , classical , rock ) I was majorly dissapointed . The bass was almost not present , and many frequencies sounded raspy . Also , I know they aren't supposed to be noise cancelling , but when I put them on it sounded as if the ambient noise was being amplified . The sound mode switch is just a selling point and does absolutely nothing noticeable . All it does is cover the already lacking bass port with a piece of plasticAlso the construction is questionableI guess these headphones are exactly what you should expect from $ 30 over ear headphones . If you love the sound quality of your music , please , spend at least $ 50 and get something you won't regret like I did with these .  
2	  This is the second time I bought this product . This time I bought two because the sound was good with a nicer mid range and a slightly better bass than my stock Apple earbuds . They definitely fit better with a choice three inserts to help seal in good sound at a lower volume to hear more tones . I like them due to the low profile size that lets me lay on my pill without them pushing into my ears . They also look nice too and I recommend them if you 're tired of regular Apple ear buds falling out of your ears frequently .  
1	  $ 75 down the drain .. If that 's your idea of fun , then this is the flash drive for you . My 2 GB Cruzer Titanium worked properly for one day before the U3 software began to cause all kinds of problems with the drive and with my laptop . The U3 Launch Pad Remover does not run correctly , so I am pretty much stuck with a stylishly designed but worthless piece of metal . San Disk troubleshooters refuse to admit that the device is defective . They blame my computer , of course .  
2	  The Philips AZ115517 CD Boombox in small , yet produces great sound . It can fit almost anywhere and can run all day ( AC power ) without overheating or skipping a track . I load up my CDR 's to the limit and they play great . Only displays the number of the cd but often the titles are so long anyway with a more expensive one you will just get a few words of the title , or just the artist name and not the song title . So that feature is not worth it . If you are that in need of reading each song title then sit in front of the computer and play the cd .  
1	  My daugter loves this toy but it won't work on the computer . But , she just loves the music . She just downloaded Baby , come back to me and say ok from Vannesa 's hudgens music . she loves it !  
2	  We have had this DVD / VCR combo for about 6months and really like it . The only thing aboutit we aren't crazy about is the remote control . Especially when in DVD mode , fast-forwarding a movie is annoying because you have to hold down the & gt ; & gt ; button to get this feature and heaven forbid you just push it , it moves you to the next chapter . Otherwise , we really enjoy this machine . Easy to use .  
1	  When my iPod is operating on the iH6 , I can hear radio reception in the background , although the radio function is obviously not on at the same time . The same thing happens when I move the machine to other places in my house . I sent one back ; iHome sent me another , but I have the same problem . I have not yet seen any reviewer 's mentioning the same issue . My iPod works perfectly in all other settings , so I cannot imagine that the problem is the iPod . I have now sent the second product back to iHome . FM radio reception was also not good , but I think that 's the location of my house , not the radio itself . I 'm disappointed , because I cannot seem to find a clock radio with iPod that buyers universally like .  
2	  Besides Taiyo Yuden brand DVD media which are always highly rated . Verbatims are held in high regard . I have tried Sony , Maxell , Memorex , TDK .. all of the usual supects and Verbatims is my media of choice . I have gone through two 50 disk spindles and can't recall getting any errors . If you find a good price stock up on these . great buy .  
1	  Not happy with this at all , its too flimsy and not very sturdy to hold books it falls down easily . :(  
1	  Its basically a mini camera you can get for less at walmart , not to mention how blurry and distorted the photo 's turn out . DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA !  
1	  No where does the info for this product does it state that it does NOT play HD-DVD discs .. Therefore the info provided is not complete .. If your looking for both the ability to play HD-DVD discs and up grade to near HD DVD , This is NOT the player you should be looking at . Also , if you want to be able to get other remotes to work with this product , they do not have their codes with larger manufactures so they can be incorporated . The unit itself plays back great , but impossible to integrate with other manufactures equipment .. Better spend 30-50 $ more not to suffer the inconvenience .  
1	  I planned to buy this product but needed some extra pre-sales info from Netgear ( a USB vs . PCMCIA Card recommendation ) . I contacted their pre-salesdepartment , which is part of their out-of-USA ( overseas ) post-sales tech support operation . After waiting 45 minutes in the phone queue on-hold , I wasdisconnected . I called again and was told I would have to wait again in the phone queue , which I declined . I instead faxed 3 top corporate officers with my helprequest , but never received a callback or other reply . I can only imagine the tech support I might have received if I had a faulty product , or if I need post-salessupport . Based on this unusually poor support experience , I instead purchased n 8-station wireless LAN from Asante , which offers excellent pre-sales support .  
1	  I was searching for a cool MP3 player and came across this one from Sony . At first it looked to be fine but there are many flaws in the product . I used sony netmd 4210 psyc for about a month and then returned it and finally ordered for an ipod shuffle . I will discuss each of the player details : User Controls : The keypads are so small that its difficult to operate them . n if u have big fingers , forget about it . it doesn't have a backlight which means u need to find some light for operating in the night . the screen is too small n cluttered . the front cover for inserting minidisc opens with lots of metallic sound and one remembers the old cassette walkmans ( those used to sound even lesser ) . its difficult to set the player bass and treble controls . its like hit n miss-sometimes it happens and when u try doing the same next time u dont get to do the same thing . i was not able to figure out that in a month . Sound Quality : Well the sound quality wasn't bad but I would say it wasn't great too . I tried with different types of music and I had to change the bass and treble everytime to make it sound a bit better . The Atrac compression causes loss in quality . U can compare the sound to some cassette player-it wasn't crystal clear-u can't get to hear everything that the music has got . I feel TDK mojo and creative 's sound better . Headphones : The headphones that come with the player sux . so be prepared to spend some cash on new better headphones . someone in the reviews had written that the headphones look the same as we get in the airlines n thats true . Space and battery : The battery life is good-doesnt eat up battery while playing . but yeah when u r transferring then it may eat up a new cell with trasferring maybe 3 minidiscs at a time . The average number of songs I was able to transfer in LP2 mode was 30-32 on a minidisc so that used to be around 2 hours of music . Forget about LP4 which boasts for 5hrs of music . the quality of music isn't worth listening in LP4 . LP2 IS OK.N u have to carry a set of minidiscs wherever u go so tht u dnt run out of music . Case : The case that comes with the player is too small-the player fits somehow and there isnt a space for anything else . i didnt like the case much . The player is also bulky . Software : The software that comes with the player is very easy to use . Lots of people had difficulty using that but its not difficult at all . Overall I would not recommend this product-guys get an ipod shuffle for the same price which looks cool n sounds awesome . n if u wanna spend some extra bucks , get an ipod or dell dj . for the music nerds , this isn't the thing u will like-the sound quality doesn't keep to the expectation .  
1	  First one came from a seller on Ebay - new in box . Self Cal issues wouldnt allow it to reset - had to return it for my money . Second one ordered direct from Escort . Paid full price so I could avoid all the third party warranty stuff . Powered it up , got 3 self Cal 's , followed by Service Required . Sent it in . Argued for a new replacement as they wanted to repair . Got a new one . Lasted 6 months , Started detecting full bar everywhere and would not reset . Sent it in again - this time they did a repair , supposedly the antenna broke . ( How I dont know , as there wasnt a scratch on it , nor was it ever dropped ) Now .. it doesnt detect as much as it did before . Oh .. and your warranty is only 1 year - regardless how many times they repair it . My Uniden from 1996 does a better job detecting than this , and it cost hundreds less . Either look at the Valentine , or try a lower cost Uniden first - You 'll be glad you did .  
2	  After a system of recent tragic tornados in our area , we realized our Midland Weather Radio had given us potentially life saving 30 minute advance warning . We purchased 3 for gifts from Amazon . com at a time when they were difficult to find in the local stores right after the storms . Excellent purchasing experience for an item that is a perfect gift . Midland WR100B Weather Radio  
2	  I have been researching Monster HTS Power Centers and wanting this unit for a long time , but i have been skeptical , a lot of reviews from multiple websites states that this unit is just a over price surge protector and saw no difference in picture or sound . Of course , there was a lot of reviews praising this unit , but there was enough review that talk down on it that made me thinking twice before getting it . The Monster HTS 3600 is a $ 500 unit , but after looking on Amazon , i saw it for under $ 300 . After looking for so long , i said , now is the time . When it arrived , i cracked open the box and plug all my electronics devices into the power center . Very easy installation , as i was cleaning up , i turned on the radio . I was amazed how much clearer the sound was . The sound was a lot deeper and crispier ( I use my system everyday , so it is not in my head ) . I dropped everything i was doing and put in a blu-ray dvd into my ps3 . The picture was significantly sharper and clearer . All the back round snow has been reduced , the people faces look so much more vibrant . Especially when i watch hdtv on my cable box . ( Regular channel is hard to tell since the resolution is so low ) . Video games on my Ps3 and Xbox 360 look a little smoother , but it is the sound that has greatly improved . There is so much i want to say , but you are going to have to find out for yourself . The bottom line is it does everything they advertised with the peace of mind of protecting your investment . I don't understand how some people said this unit is just for show . It probably depends on what you have . This is a must buy !  
2	  Very good . Sometimes I have a little trouble with reception otherwise it works good .  
1	  This unit drives me crazy . rarely use the unit and waited too long to return / exchange at Best Buy . The audio drops out every few seconds . Both the digital and analog feeds are affected . On last day of warranty , LG agreed to repair or replace . Got a reconditioned replacement and it too has the same problems . I wish I would have read reviews before purchasing . This was a lot of money to pay for lousy audio . Otherwise , picture an ease of use is nice .  
2	  I have purchased several of these cables and have had no problems at all with the quality of the picture or sound . I would compare them to any other high priced HDMI cables I purchased in the past . I will never go back to spending store prices for these cables and would recommend them to all  
1	  I have this router for over an year now and as the time progressed , the router 's performance has deteriorated . As of today , it drops connection every 5 minutes . I have heard similar complaints from my co-workers about this router . I would not recommend this product .  
1	  the product was really good i really liked it the only problem was that it died after 2 weeks ! of purchase .  
2	  I 've only had the opportunity to use it once or twice , but the picture was clear , and the lag wasn't bad .  
2	  I don't share the sentiments of the previous four reviewers of this product , but hey I havent even had the DVD Recorder even a week yet , but so far , I love it . At $ 98.74 @ Walmart the price was right , and it does seem too good to be true , I hope I don't live to eat those words . But I record my favorite shows / movies and they play flawlessly , I transfered my old VHS tape home videos onto DVD they play fantastic and will preserve the footage for generations . Now generally the cause of malfunction for a product causes usually range from not maintaining the product properly , they include an instruction manual for a reason , not just to tell you how to work the darn thing . But all and all I love my ILO 's DVD Recorder and I can now say I will use old VHS Tapes as Paper Weights .  
1	  I could not get the transmitter to work with my car stereo . All the stations I tried came through fuzzy . It was awful . They 're sending me a replacement but we 'll see . Not worth the money / time / effort .  
2	  This manufactured ink is great . Buy an empty ink cartridge for under $ 20 , and you can refill it for under $ 10 .. saves you hundreds a year if you are a heavy printer or a college student and have to write a lot of papers . If you are just a casual printer , then it won't make too much difference . The one main problem is that the printer indication ( the stuff that pops up as you print to let you know of any problems and status of printing ) will read " Black ink is low . Click below now to order a new cartridge from Lexmark " . Well , I don't like popups and reminders annoy me , not to mention i have little patience , and i can personally handle it . To me , it 's better to close reminder popups and save money each year , than to overspend and avoid the popups . ( I heard on a forum that if you put your regular tape on the left side of the contacts - as you are looking at the cartridge and at the side of the orangish contact strip facing the back of the printer - the popups will stop . Your printer will register a question mark on the ink , but it will still print without nagging reorder messages )  
1	  Purchased one of these locally ( Seattle - King County Area ) for use with sansa 512 mb mp3 player . Was completely unable to even hear my mp3 player over the radio instead what I got was KPLU ( Pacific Lutheran Universities ) radio station playing Reggae , Jazz or NPR clips . Do not buy if there is a radion station anywhere on 88 FM in your area because that station will be all you get .  
1	  One of the speakers had very poor treble response compared to the other - I would guess a fault with something . Even the other one sounded really muted compared to a Cambridge Soundworks outdoor speaker that has weathered 7 New England winters .  
2	  A good protective case . it fits perfectly the contour of the treo 680 not disturbing ordinary use or charge .. but does not allow you to insert / remove memory card ( only if you " modify it " ) . Very good value . If screen protection is requeried I 'd rather buy an alluminium case as I did to my palm zire 72 .. THAT WOULD REALLY DISTURB ORDINARY USE AS A MOBILE PHONE .  
1	  I received the ViewSonic VG150 today . I used it to replace a functioning monitor on a Hewlett Packard Pavilion computer . The screen remained black . The amber LED changed to a flashing green LED but the screen remained black . I called ViewSonic tech support and after trying various procedures I was advised to return the monitor to the place of purchase . I returned the monitor and would not feel comfortable purchasing this type of monitor in the future .  
2	  This is number two for us . Two adults and two teens have used this mouse ( and it 's predecessor ) for daily purposes for more than 6 yrs . The only reason we 've had two is the cable on the first one ( on the mouse end ) just couldn't last beyond 6 yrs . The mechanism in the mouse is still completely functional ( and the cable will get repaired as soon as time permits ) .  
2	  Needed to hotsync my Palm IIe via USB . Bought a cheap USB serial adapter on ebay with Prolific chipset . Installed and Windows XP said all was working , but no communication with Palm IIe via serial hotsync cradle . Saw online posts complaining that many USB serial adapters aren't fully functional and don't work with all applications because they lack full compatibility . Read that the Startech adapter works great , but found this one on sale and decided to try it . Installed easily in minutes - unlike the driver CD I got on ebay that I spent a couple hours trying to get to work ! Just plugged it in and Windows XP found the driver on the CD . Very nice software app for monitoring and configuring the port . You can download the latest drivers on Tripp-Lite 's website ( I got 3.4 on the CD , but the website now has 3.7 available as of today ) . The serial port is male ( just like the one 's on the back of older computers ) , and has screw holes if you want to attach a cable permanently . It has a USB Type B connector , and comes with a USB Type A to Type B cable . ( Type A is the standard flat connector on most laptops . ) There is a green status LED on the adapter that flashes to show communication status . Made in China , but worked great for me .  
1	  This printer pulls enough power to make the lights flicker in my mom 's house . Admittedly , the house 's wiring is old . But this printer says it needs 7.7 amps ( that 's what the tag on the back says , not what Brother 's web site says ) , while the comparable HP printer uses 2.2 amps . Even if you have modern wiring in your house or business , you might not want to waste that much juice .  
1	  Why they named this product " Minstrel " is beyond me , as it 's capacity to put on a convincing minstrel show is completely absent . I busted some of the gears up ( or whatever these doo-hickey 's have ) trying to smear on some black application . Plus , this thing doesn't even sing classics like " De Boatman 's Dance " , or " Stop Dat Knocking . " 2 stars .  
2	  Very Very good at what it does . Bluetooth works well . Very easy to learn . I recommend it to everyone  
1	  This product is great in theory , but so far I haven't been able to use it . It does not appear to be compatible with my Sony ICD-UX71 digital voice recorder . It might have been nice if someone had told me that before I bought the thing . Inside the box , in tiny letters , it says the transcription system is only compatible with ICD-ST , SX , MS , BM , BP and P series Sony recorders . So now I guess I have to spring for a new recorder as well . The system looks simple enough if you have a compatible recorder . The foot pedal plugs right into your computer . I 'm looking forward to seeing how well it works with Dragon Naturally Speaking voice recognition software .  
2	  This product worked just as I expected . I plugged it in , Windows XP found it and I was ready to go . Couldn't be easier .  
1	  This is really a POS and I will never purchase another XtremeMac product again . I purchased the Xtremehd 4-PORT HDmi Switcher by XtremeMac when they were first announced in January 2008 . After waiting 4 months for the product to arrive I had no need for it as I had purchased a different model from MonoPrice and put the switcher unopened in a closet . I remembered the switcher two weeks ago and decided I could use it now . Unboxed the product , plugged it in and it was DOA.I assumed that it probably needed a new battery for the remote as there is no power switch on the switcher itself but power is controlled through the remote only . After purchasing a new battery I tried to install it into the remote , but there is no indication which direction the battery needs to be installed . I tried the battery in both directions but the switcher was still DOA either way . I just got finished speaking with some " offshore " support representative of Xtrememac and that was as futile as it sounds . Since I am SOL due to the time lapse for the warranty I now have a $ 99.00 BRICK ! Buyer Beware with Xtrememac !  
2	  First off , nice CD player . A lot of reviews had some things wrong in them .. Battery life : 15 hours MP3 cds , 7-9 regular cds Shock protection : 120 sec for mp3 's , however , to save batteries , the buffer fills up and then the disc stops spinning , and when the buffer gets low , it spins the disc up again . Therefore , there is little skip protection at the beginning of the song . And yes , this is not a joggable cd player . 40 sec or 10 sec ( switchable ) for regular cds . And hello people ! FIRMWARE ! YAAY ! And the firmware is the best so far . P>Overall , a very good cd player . Oh , the headphones " . Buy some good Koss ones .  
2	  I bought the 720sw for its shock and water proof ratings . I work and play in some harsh condictions . So far its all I can ask for in a compact digital camera and easy to use , compact , quality pictures and something I didnt plan on . Its video capacity is really good , I tested the video on a 1GB H XD card and it held 45 minutes . I got a small belt case for it and it just looks like a cell phone . I can carry it anywhere .. I will never miss a great shot or video clip again :-) Tom  
1	  I 've gone through two of these and I 'm currently shopping for a new universal remote . One requirement I have at this point is " No Logitech " . The unit worked fine with LNS-4095 40 " Samsung TV other than the following problems : a ) Key contacts would wear out rendering function keys useless ; b ) Keys were so small that my ( average size ) male hands would quite often press two keys at a time ; c ) The contacts would become fouled which required a careful cleaning of the contacts on both the charging base and the contacts on the unit . This was very annoying in that I thought the unit was charging when in fact it was sitting there discharged ; and when I would go to use it I would find out it had no charge . Then I got a new TV . When I went to set up the new TV and remove the old TV ( Samsung LNS-4095 ) for the unit , some timing element or another seemed to hang around from the old TV set codes to the new one ( Sony KDL-52W5100 ) . Consequently the unit would never correctly switch the HDMI correctly either from or to the BD player . Imagine spending a few frustrating hours working the software only to come up blank time and time again . FYI I had the following attached to the machine : TVHD DVD PlayerBD DVD PlayerOppo upscaling DVD playerScientific Atlanta cable DVR . . . and at one point a Monoprice HDMI switch . The first unit went dead while in the warranty period and to Logitech 's credit , they faithfully replaced the faulty unit with a new one . This worked about 8 months and now I need a new unit . Because of the aforementioned problems I do not want a new Logitech unit . I would summarize that the small keys , contact problems , and some sort of programming glitch when clearing out the old TV when installing the new one , and worn-out key contacts rendering the affected key worthless are my major gripes along with the relatively short lifespan of the unit while still costing as much as it does . I do not recommend buying this at all .  
2	  This was the cheapest scanner with the specs I was looking for in an at home scanner . I use it probably every other day , mostly to at home deposits . I 've only used it a couple of times for pictures ( some old 1940s pics ) and they came out good enough to blow up from the small wallet size pic to a 3 " X5 " . The speed isn't the greatest , takes about 15-20 secs to boot up and about the same amount of time to scan , so probably not ideal for scanning a ton of pics .  
2	  Althogh some people have been saying that the Rio Carbon is better , I highly disagree . The iPod has games and other extras while the R.C. doesn't . The R.C. has 5 gigab . of space compared to the iPod 's 4 , but can't hold many more songs . If Documents is what you are interested in , still get the iPod because your average document is 5-10KB , and there are a 100KB in a Megab . ( is that right or is it a 1000 ? I 'm not sure . ) and a 1000 Magab . in a Gigab . times 4 , I think you 'll have enough space !  
1	  Though I think the phone looks and sounds great , and I am pleased with the range , the battery truly dies within a year . It will happen all at once , too , with the first 6 months being great , and slight issues with long calls in the next 3 months , and finally total collapse at the one year mark . Now I am down to charging it all the time , and I only get a 30 minute conversation in ( once per day ) before the phone dies . This is not a fluke , unfortunately , as I also bought the same Panasonic Phone for my brother , and his died before the one year mark , too . Really a pain , as I 've had other cordless phones for years without problems . Do I really have to purchase a $ 40 battery every YEAR ? The answer , of course , is NO . I just need to buy a new phone with a better battery !  
1	  I purchased the Vista CX after wanting to upgrade from my Legend . The first out caching , the unit was very eradic and took me 400 ' feet from the cache . After calibrating the compass , I got within 80 ' feet . Second cache it got within 90 ' of it . Garmin CS said they never heard of this but the Vista I purchased two years did the same thing . They both were returned , needless to say . If you want a great no frills GPS , stick with the Legend . Most cachers with higher end Garmins fuss about the cords being off from lower end units . Garmin just can't see to make the expensive units with many features be accurate . The Vista line keeps building on a poor platform . I am waiting on my new Magellan Explorist 500 from Amazon .  
1	  I had this attached to a PC in the garage , and it died after a couple of months . Not sure if it is was a problem with the environment - dust , moisture , etc . I liked it for value / functionality , but be warned it may not be suitable for rugged environments .  
2	  I may buy a few more of these ! They may not be perfect compared to the more expensive binoculars , but hey , these were the right price and they get the job done ! Excellent value . No problems .  
1	  I bought this printer server partly because of the good reviews here . It works well mostly , but I did encountered a few problems that I feel worth mentioning : 1 . The manual says Internet printing ( LPR ) is supported , but in fact it is not . The related settings mentioned in the manual do not exist in the web admin interface . I am referring to the sections " Printer Tab - Internet Printing " and " Printer Tab - Logical Port " in Charpter 6 of the manual . 2 . A more serious problem is that whenever my printer goes into sleep , i.e. automatically powers off , the USB connection is lost . The only way to get the USB connection back is to unplug and re-plug the USB cable . This is a huge pain to me . I am using Brother HL-6050D .  
1	  Don't waste your time with this camera or any other Sony products , they don't stand behind thier products and will give you a bunch of excuses on why they won't fix it .  
2	  Great cases , unfortunately they stopped making them . I bought all I could at the time . I hope they start making them again .  
1	  Your records may indicate that i never received the above item . Luckily , it wasn't an expensive item . It 's the first time Amazon has ever let me down . Ah Well , Larry  
1	  Great if you like to have coasters that look like old 45 's :( No joke . I love the look , but I 'm not into wasting time and money , and I used both a Plextor Burner and a Lite-On , ( both are fast dual core pc 's ) , so it 's not my hardware . Very dissapointed , I 'll never buy Verbatim products again .  
1	  I purchased this item because it was listed with the new video 30 GB iPod . It never said that it wasn't compatable ! That information would have been helpful .  
2	  I really don't know what those guys are talking about , I got this sub and I put it on my 600 watt kenwood surround sound amp with an rca cable . I turned that sucker on and i was amazed by how good the sound was coming from it . And it is ten inch you can't really beat that fot the price you would have to spend like 300 to 700 dollars for a ten inch anywhere else . plus it sounds as good if not better than half of the big names . I had a yamaha sub and this kills it for the sound part and looks . Plus the yamaha broke . So if you have a amp with a sub rca jack in the back i recommend this sub . but if you have a mini system don't get it . but i recomend this sub .  
2	  it works perfect just like the one that came out of the tv will buy one again if i ever need to  
2	  Although this book has received an amazing amount of publicity , wade through it and read the novel on its own terms . I haven't read The Secret History , so have no comparison to make between the two , but judging from the quality of Tartt 's writing , we are in the presence of a REAL WRITER , someone with the skill to make readers sit up an take notice . The novel centres on the fading glory of the old South , with its dilapidated mansions and issues of class and hierarchy still central to the characters . Tarrt 's writing is a refreshing change to the precious plots that are often sold as modern literature . The writing is imaculate and although it is a " long " novel , it is not long-winded . By the end of the novel I was completely drawn in and my university texts sat unread as I eagerly read to the end . I found it utterly convincing and satisfying without the traces of sentimentality that often cloud books about the South . It was well worth the ten year wait !  
1	  I recently replaced my happily owned 3550 with a bad sensor with a new3600n . I didn't even consider the fact that this " upgrade " would performworse than the previous model . But It Does ! If you are looking for sharplines & rich colors this is not the machine for you . By comparison to the 3550 it iswashed out with crappy line art . The text is crisp , but too faint .  
1	  Brand new - out of the box , I installed the MONSTER HTS3600 MKII and connect a Sony KDL-52W3000 LCD TV ; Sony BluRay BDPS350 ; Mitsubishi VCR & Yamaha RX-V2700 Receiver to it . It should be noted that the MONSTER HTS3600 MKII was the only new addition and everything worked very well prior . Immediately , I noticed a darker picture with even darker corners . The picture had lost detail as well - of course it was hard to tale with a darker screen . So I began to tweak the TV , when I thought wait a minute why should I have to increase the backlight & brightness , etc . for this new unit . Well - back to the manual .. The manual is worthless . It would appear to be more of an advertisement than a manual with more information about Noel Lee & the Designers than how to use the product . I tried to go online [ .. ] ) to get specific information , such as - are LCD TV 's considered to be digital devices for filtering purposes ? All I could find was more advertisement - who cares ! For the most part I feel I have purchased a very expensive Surge Protector and Volt / Amp Meter . This product has convinced me of what I had previously suspected - Monster products are mostly " Hype " much like the Emperor 's New Clothes ! ( Ref : [ .. ] ) .. " What a perfect fit ! " No one wanted it to be noticed that he could see nothing , for then it would be said that he was unfit for his position or that he was stupid . None of the emperor 's clothes had ever before received such praise .  
1	  HI MA NAME IS TOM , AI CAME TO YOUR SITE MY FREINDS HAVE RECOMDED IT , THE GARMAN NAVAGITATION IS WELL NO GOOD IT SENDS YOU IN THE WRONG WAY , AFTER SPEEKING WITH THE GARMAN SERVICE REP , REPROGRAMING THE UNIT , IT IS VERY SAD TO SEE CONPANY 'S SUCH AS ELECTRONICA DIRECT AND AMAZON NOT WILLING FOR ME TO RETURN THIS PRODUCT , NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY FROM THIS SITE OF ANY COMPANY , S YOU WORK WITHTOM NARDONE  
1	  I ordered a stylus from them . It says " hurry only 20 left in stock " right below the items image . I get an email saying they are out and my order has been cancelled . I sell things on AMazon . I know how easy it is to keep your inventory up to date . DO IT !  
1	  The remote control never worked . I was trying something else for a while , cause i thought the remote was working , but today I took my car the the shop , and they tried the GPS unit with another remote , and it worked just fine . Now I can't return the product . so it sucks .  
1	  Faxes are received as bar codes . HP knows a problem exist with the formatter board but it took 4 calls to customer support for the problem to be acknowledged . To fix this under warranty HP wants to charge $ 50 for a refurbished copier sent overnight . I want the copier repaired at no cost at the local repair center but HP will not send the part . The part is backordered with " no estimate ship date " . I can buy the part as an end user for $ 193 . HP does not stand behind it 's products .  
2	  This is my second Harmony remote . I think these are the best ! My previous 3 year old unit broke after being dropped one to many times . I ordered the XBOX version to better control my xbox and media center PC . I went online and the Harmony software converted my settings to the new remote in just a couple minutes . No fuss , no worries - GET A HARMONY  
1	  Since a photo has not been posted yet ( as of 3/18/02 ) I did some research on this model on the Panasonic website . This product does not have an LCD screen so if you are looking for a portable player with monitor , this is not for you .  
2	  I like to use my Ham radio with headphones , so I can hear and pick out the weak signals . This headset is perfect for ICOM radios that require an Electrec microphone . I have worn these for extended periods without them hurting my ears or getting too hot .  
2	  In my house there is a constant battle between getting great hi tech gear and needing it to be easy to use . I am the geek and my wife if the " make it easy " person . This camcorder fits the bill for both . She gets the " easy " button and I can tweak the camera to a reasonable degree for someone who knows nothing about videotography . I know computers and once I get the video on the hard disk and into the editing software I can do what I want . With our kids we wanted something to capture memories and the HD 16:9 aspect was a must for me . I don't see this as expensive when I think of what I am capturing . One small note for everyone though is that although you can capture in HD you can't make a DVD in HS yet . Sure , a SMALL number of you can but for the masses in the US the HD DVD burners are not available . Shoot your film now and keep it for when you can burn our own HD DVDs . It will not be that long and tapes are cheap .  
2	  I have taken many many pictures on this card . It runs very fast in my SLR , and is a very good card . SanDisk makes some good stuff . I get very fast Bursts of pictures in my Canon SLR , and overall , the card has performed great ! I would totally recommend this .  
1	  Stay away from this product as the hinge is of poor design and when it fails will crack the plastic housing the screen . Polaroid will not stand behind this product or repair it when out of warranty . They will offer you a replacement for $ 150.00 with the same results . Stay away and find something else !  
1	  I sure wish I had read these reviews before I bought this printer . I know for a fact that every time it sounds like it 's charging or whatever , it is spilling ink onto that pad that 's inside . I had to quit using it because it had about a 1 inch black wet line running down the page , the paper would fall apart it was so wet . Then I would tell it to print like 3 pages and the black wet line faded some , but it was still huge and dark and unusable , then when it finished printing the 3 pages it would do it 's little charge thing ( aka drinking ink ) then the first page I would print would have this sopping wet 1-inch line going down the middle . On top of that , Canon told me all I had to do was take it into their nearest shop and they would put a printhead in for me . Well , I 've done that before on a previous Canon printer . This place is 100 miles from my house , one way ! I had to take it up there and they refused to even mail it back to me . I told the tech if all it needed was a printhead then I 'll buy a new printhead and put it in myself . Ok , I spent $ 75.00 on a printhead and it didn't make a bit of difference and I couldn't return it , because I had opened the box ! ( anybody want to buy a cheap printhead ? ) So then I thought instead of chunking it I would use it as a scanner or fax machine , HA that was a joke too , when the ink ran out ( mysteriously evaporated , cause I wasn't printing anything ) , it locked up the whole machine ! I tried to fool the thing by filling an ink tank with water , that didn't work . So since I had 5 unused Canon ink cartridges on hand ( all black ) I opened all of those brand new expensive ink cartridges and put them in and this thing KNEW they were not the right colors and it continues to be locked up . Another thing , don't think you can try generic ink cartridges either , it knows they are generic and won't print ! I 've had it , now it 's going to the garbage dump . I 'll never buy another Canon , 1st time shame on Canon , 2nd time shame on me ! :(  
2	  Sweet little player ! Great sound , cool features , unbeatable price ! Stick your SD card in and you 'll never hear the same song twice ! I 'm very pleased with this purchase !  
2	  This HDMI cable has one end DVI and the other HDMI . It fits between a new Samsung Plasma TV and a 6-yr-old DVD player in my home theater . This item was not available at my electronics stores ( Best Buy , Radio Shack ) . The price was 1/3 as much as similar cables from Best Buy , and delivered 4-days after I placed my online order one night . Great performance Amazon . com and your partner supplier .  
1	  I wish I would of done a bit of research on external hard drives before this purchase . My drive would not light or startup after 4 days of use . Don't take my word for it .. Just look at the hundreds of posts on forums and bogs regarding the " My Book " line of WD drives and you will see how widespread the issues / failures are . It 's ridiculous .  
2	  What can you say about an earbud travel case ? It was as advertized and it fulfils its purpose  
1	  This thing has poor sound quality ! All the " S " and " SH " sounds hiss . It 's irritating ! And the slightest movement of your iPod produces static . ATTENTIONThose with the cigarette lighter right by the stick shift , this product is NOT for you ! Can't shift to first or third with this thing plugged in . I returned this the same day I bought and exchanged it for the Monster iCarPlay Wireless Plus . Monster is waay better ! From the reviews for Kensington , I thought it was the best . I should 've taken the advice from a friend and bought the Monster one instead . The Monster one feels better made than the Kensington . But the sound is 100 times better . No hissing sound or static . If you 're going to buy an FM Transmitter / Car Charger , buy theMONSTER ICARPLAY WIRELESS PLUSYou 'll be very happy with the Monster one .. TRUST ME !  
2	  Compared alot of different noise cancelling headphones before I bought these and couldnt be happier . Have used them on several flights and the noise cancelling quality is very good . One of the great features on these headphones is that even if the batteries in the phones wear out , you can still listen to music from your MP3 / Ipod , as opposed to Bose and others . Also , without batteries the passive noise cancellation quality is still pretty good . These are one of the most comfortable set of phones I 've ever used , as well . Can wear them on a 3 hour flight with no ear or head fatigue . Make no mistake , a new pair of these are expensive but if you 're going to spend this kind of money on a pair of headphones , I believe you 'll be more please with these than say a comparable pair of Bose .  
2	  Sony MDR-XD200 Stereo HeadphonesI listen to music all day long at work . I really like the 10 foot cord . The sound is crisp and clear . I can really crank the volume up and the other people around me cannot hear what I am listening too at the volume that I am listening to . They are big and bulky no doubt but I will take that for the clarity of sound that I get . The Treble and Bass frequences come across clear . I have not noticed a differences in the Sound / Movie feature . I get all the Highs and Lows . The Sound Quality is almost as good as the Custom Bulit Bose system in my Truck . I have also used these Sony MDR-XD200 Headphones for Gaming and the quality of sound does not change at all . They are well made and sturdy . Some people complain about it hurts after a few hours , my opinion of what they say is ; I weared my Sony MDR-XD200 Headphones for approx 11 hours a day by 5 days a week . , I have not problem with the comfort and they do not hurt . Kudos to Sony for the Sony MDR-XD200 Stereo Headphones . I love them .  
1	  Let me preface this review by saying I have Been around electronic navigation devices for years . I currently own a Garmin Etrex Handheld , and a Garmin 2620 Both have been flawless . I bought the Magellan 6000t because of the traffic functionality and I liked the graffic display . I paid full price when it came out around $ 599 at Best Buy . I have owned it now for 6 months here is the laundry list of problems . I DO HAVE THE LATEST FIRMWARE UPDATE . Which seems to be 1 every 2 months . 1 . ) If unit over heats ( sun ) or is too cold , unit will shut down . Needs along time to reset . 2 . ) When the un it shuts down it actually resets itself and loses all and anything stored , YES THATS MEANS ALL SAVE WAYPOINTS , ADDRESSES , ETC . 3 . ) # 2 above happens daily so why bother to store anything . 4 . ) Takes for ever to aquire satellites ( start up ) unless you are in an open field . 5 . ) Bought the traffic subscription , only problem is it doesn't work . You have to enter this rediculously long code to tell the unit you are a subscribing member . Only problem is the unit doesn't remeber the code , so I have to enter this 30 something long ID code every time I start up the unit and drive if I want the traffic to work . 6 . ) You have to fully charge the unit in order to connect to your computer , pain b / c unit only comes with car charger . 7 . ) Lost touch screen functionality after 4 months . After talking to India for several hours they told me to send it in . I know I 'll probably never see it again . Trust me .. buy a Garmin . Never had 1 problem let alone 7  
1	  I have a unibody MacBook pro , 15 " , and this protector didn't come anywhere close to fitting it . It was way too small . I don't know if they sent me the wrong one or what , but I 'm not going to spend time waiting to see if the next one fits-I 'll just get a refund .  
2	  Very good product . Directions simple and easy to follow . We get a lot of severe weather in our area of Ohio and this radio has helped to alert us to several situations .  
2	  Purchased this item after reading a great professional review . I simply wanted to hide away my cable box behind closed doors , and operate it with my own remote . This works perfectly . It 's as simple as installing the transmitter in the battery area . The only other thing that you may need to do is change the switch inside the main unit . I had a few questions , and I emailed the manufacturer . I received an answer within one day . I am thinking that I should have purchased additional transmitters as well . Easy easy easy .  
1	  When looking for a card scanner that would work with my Macintosh computer , the ad for this scanner state that it would work with both PC and MAC computers , which caused me to purchase this item . When received , it became apparent that it did not work with MAC Computers . Very disappointing , indeed . I was able to sell this one to a friend who needed one for her PC , which relieved me of having to try returning the item . Please make sure that all copy is correct .  
2	  I was very skeptical about spending 100 $ on earphones , but I couldn't stand the ipod phones any longer . I consider these to be the underdogs , the " Get your money 's worth , and more " type of product . They look amazing , fit really well , and are very , very durable . If you are going from ipod earphones , you WILL be amazed at how much a difference your music will be . Once broken in , these perform much better . The bass is not overpowering , and the clarity is much better . The overall sound is very warm . People need to break these phones in , as the sound out of the box will not " Wow " you right away . People who are saying these are overrated are just angry that they spent over 200 $ or more on phones that aren't much better then the V-Moda 's . This is definitely quality . Cheesy pouch .  
1	  I can understand 5-10 days for shipping . I don't get 5-7 days to even pick it off a shelf and get it to UPS . Same day I bought something from Newegg , same 5-10 day shipping and I had it two days later . Forget Amazon !  
2	  substantial material and well made . connects well with no extra effort . this wsa used on audio cable with no adverse affect on sound  
2	  RCA 50Ft . 16 Gauge Speaker Wire . Great price for a lot of wire it became handy to hook up the Speakers to the A / V Receiver . The wire is thick and strong I like the fact that one strand is in white color on the insulation of one of the conductors so you know how to hook it up the same way at both ends , it makes it very easy , it does a good job ! The Speaker wire arrived very fast from Amazon . com with out any problems . Thank You  
1	  These Sony MDR-Q23LP headphones hurt if you wear them for a few hours at a time like I do . I go for long distance walks and like having my iPod with me . If you plan on wearing these for 20 minutes , you should be fine . But for several hours , these headphones begin to pinch your earlobes . I read warnings about this in product reviews right here on Amazon before I decided to purchase them but I assumed that the users had big ears ! Thus I ignored these bad reviews . That was stupid ! In fact , I have small ears and these headphones DEFINITELY pinch . I would have kept quiet but I just received an email from Amazon asking me for my opinion so here it is . Don't buy these . The best I can say is that they are not as bad as earbuds .  
2	  I purchased , from Amazon , these batteries with the charger at the same time I purchased the CoolPix 5600 last May 2005 . I have shot about 1,000 pictures so far . The batteries need to be recharged between 200-250 shots . The batteries are still holding their charge just fine . I recommend them . Actually , my complaint is with the CoolPix because the battery meter doesn't measure battery strength so you can't tell if you 're batteries are close to needing a charge .  
1	  I just purchased this product & I 've noticed that its hard to get on my camera body & when I did get it on & turned it on , it came on but wouldn't flash ! I 'm wondering if its compatible with my Nikon D5000 ? Hope that someone can help me !  
1	  I am soo sorry I purchased this scanner . All it did was totally mess up my Dell system . I had to hire a computer technician to undo all the damage and hidden files , and drivers that this item came with . I 've used Visioneer before , with no problem . This one was a lemon . Oh , I almost forgot to mention the scanning light could not be recalibrated .  
2	  We bought 4 cables , just because the price was so low . They work great so far !  
1	  Disappointing product . If you only have a computer that you 're connecting to the internet , it works fine . I also have a wireless HP printer , and the router regularly disconnects me from the internet and fails to complete long print jobs . I would be careful about buying this product if you intend to use it to communicate between different wireless devices .  
1	  I think Mobile Edge makes a nice product which is why I bought this case . But I was disappointed when I received it because it just looked and felt like it was too big and clunky for my new 15.6 " Dell . Even for its size , I was surprised that my basic laptop accessories didn't seem to easily fit in the available compartments . I decided to return the case and see if I could find something that fit what I was looking for more closely .  
1	  I purchased this item last month . After two days of receiving the charger , it was sensitive , meaning I would need to wiggle before the connection would charge . A customer service representative contacted me in attempt to remove or alter my last review . They offered to refund or exchange the charger for removal of my review . After accepting the proposal , I removed my review . Since then , it has been three weeks and I have not received a refund or exchange . Now , the charger does not work at all , regardless of wiggling the insert piece . I would not recommend purchasing this item .  
1	  Beware before buying ! I purchase this scanner a little over a year ago . It broke down in four months . After 4 one hour phone calls to thier tech . line , long distance ( customer pays ) , they couldn't solve the problem . Then after dealing with customer service and another 4 phone calls they finally replaced the scanner . Four months later again .. it broke . Several more phone calls to thier tech . center and 5 letters to the customer service and CEO they finally replaced it again . WARNING - do not buy this scanner without an extended warrenty . I have had nothing but grief with it and Canon 's represenitves ! They are now refunding my money in full ! However I have spent countless hours on the phone , writing letters , trips to the post office for shipping , buying uneeded parts they recomended , and money , to recieve the help required !  
2	  i have beat , dropped and abused this little pit bull . great reception , battery life is forever . the antenna broke off long ago but still works good . highly recommend  
2	  Great HDMI cable . I 'm very happy with the performance of this cable . If you pay a lot for an HDMI cable , you 're a fool .  
1	  I bought these in February , and used them sporadically for a couple months before first one earphone seemed to short out , giving inconsistent sound , then the other one within a week so now they 're garbage . Don't bother buying this cheap junk . The sound quality is terrible and they don't last .  
2	  Ok I was going to write a long story about how I got here but who really cares . The bottom line is this unit completely rocks . I compared it to the Sony SXRDs and the JVC 1080P ILAs - both are 1080P displays but will not accept a 1080P signal . The picture is incredible - truely like an 8 megapixel photo in HD . Even Home Theater Mag rated its performace ( 96 ) higher than the Sony ( 94 ) , JVC ( 92 ) and all the DLP ( < 90 ) units in its 2/2006 HDTV face off . But remember its a monitor not a TV so you 'll need to either have a cable box , sat receiver , computer or external tuner . Actually this is one monitor which you can hook everything up to since it has 5 HD inputs . I 've only found one weakness - sometimes when switching between sources it sometimes looses sinc and goes pink - but its easily fixed by switching again to another source and back .  
1	  I have the same problem as everybody else . My HP TX1000 stopped working after a year . It gets really really hot , it fries the motherboard , first wifi disappears , then the whole thing shuts off and it turns into an expensive and fancy paperweight . HP technical support is neither technical nor support . It 's time HP stopped selling these pieces of crap and recalled themGOR GOD 'S SAKE DO NOT BUY HP DO NOT BUY NVIDIADON'T GET RIPPED OFF  
2	  Recently bought this lens for a trip to Yellowstone . It performed quite well ; very intuitive , easy to handle , and easy to swap between my standard lens and this one on my Rebel T-2 . Managed to get some good shots of grizzlies and a black bear , as well as bison , etc . At times I wished I had gone with a longer lens , the bighorn sheep were quite a distance off , so a longer ( and more expensive ) lens would have been helpful . But , for general purpose , and portability ( which was one of my main criteria ) , I was more than satisfied . The optics are clear and focusing precise . It would be nice if they offered a hard case for the lens ; my old Tamron telezoom had a nice hardened foam lined leather case ; alas I could not find one for this so I substituted a Tamrac , nylon and foam case that worked adequately .  
2	  I paired this sub with the yamaha 6490'sThis sub is deep defined and natural sounding . In my opinion it is the best sounding sub at this price point . I simply dont agree with the folks that rate this as a home theater only sub . I listen to an ecceltic mix of music and i particularly appreciate the accuracy and realism when i play jazz . I could go on and on as this sub amazes me everytime i listen to it . Oh yeah .. jayzee and fity rock on this thing ! If you 're looking for a very versital , musical sub at a ridiculasly modest price , get this ! Oh , its very well built and attractive too .  
2	  This sound card really produces some great sound . Just be aware of the software that it installs . I upgraded the software from their website and it installed several items in my startup registry especially one called DLLML that was eating up CPU when it was running idle . It 's not needed and I highly recommend disabling it .  
1	  Be forewarned , this product is not 480Mbps as it states on the site . It is a 12Mbps USB extension . The technical details show it as 480Mbps which would indicate USB 2.0 . 1-star for product review , but 5-stars as always to Amazon 's customer service / return policy .  
2	  HDMI cables aren't particularly complicated contraptions , so there 's no need to go for a super premium version . This does what it 's supposed to - deliver high quality video and audio - at a terrific price .  
1	  I bought this for work and I 'm extremely disappointed . I thought that with a 4 star rating I was good to go .. WRONG ! I should have read the reviews carefully . Getting the memory stick in and out is an act of God ! I can physically do it , but I 'm worried that I 'm wrecking the reader . I 've done it 5-6 times so far and my fingers hurt from pressing down on the card . I have fairly strong fingers , but for the ladies in the office it 's going to be basically unusable without tweezers or pliers . Run from this product . We have other card readers ( two at home , two at work ) that are all identical . They are made my Lexar and they work much better than this one . I should have bought another one of those ! All I can hope is that this one wears in and we don't wreck our new 2MB memory card in the process . DON'T BUY THIS ! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED ! * UPDATE * After taking the card out and putting it back in about 50 times and it 's loosened up considerably . If I would have received the reader like this I probably wouldn't have given it a bad review . However , I had to " manhandle " the thing to get the card in and out the first dozen times . I intentionally bent the reader because another review said it helped loosen the card . Did I damage anything , I 'm not sure , it 's working for now . I still recommend buying a different reader !  
1	  This is the second HP CD-Writer I purchased from HP and I expected the same great performance . I was disappointed . The product installed quickly , but I had the first sign of trouble reading a Rewriteable CD that contained data from my first HP drive . After erasing some directories , the CD became unreadable and hung the system . After powering down , all the data was gone and I couldn't read it on the other drive . I call HP and they walked me through the installation process in safe mode , but this did not fix the problem and it happened again with a second disk . I installed the drive on a second computer and it happened again . HP told me that it might be the Memorex media and I should use ' higher quality ' media . I believe this , but then tried burning an ISO file and after 3 disks failed to finish , I gave up . In the end , I probable spent 8 hours trying to get this drive to work and HP 's techical support wasn't much help . Drive was sent back and I 'll either go for an internal drive or one from another manufacturer . I never did figure out what the root cause was , but either its HP 's hardware , their drivers , or both of my computers have non-standard USB ports . Since I have Dell Laptops , I would expect they had ' standard ' USB ports . Frustrated .  
1	  Purchased this item two months ago . I used it four times and now it shows a " dew detected " warning . The camera then shutdown and no longer works . I did some research and found this is a common problem , not only with this model , but several other Panasonic products . The problem is due to a detective module that Panasonic uses and the only way to fix it is a repair bill of $ 150 . I have tried several times to contact Panasonic , but have received no response . Until Panasonic upgrades their parts and customer service I would buy elsewhere .  
2	  I bought it to laminate my Medicare card worked well . I plan on using it for some photos I want to carry in my wallet as well .  
1	  If you have Vista or plan on upgrading in the future JUST DONT BUY this card . It has been a complete waste of money for me . It is not even remotely compatible with vista , just do an internet search with vista xfi xtreme music problems . I 'm into computers and haven't been able to make their drivers for vista work since may 2007 when I bought the card like many others as you will see if you do the search . Good luck choosing a good card !  
1	  When I got my set I was really upset to find out that somebody tried to installed this set up before All the pick ups had the wires cut up really short showing an attempt to install them by splicing the previous connections not to rewire the whole thing , the middle pickup was defective .. I got a new set but it took two weeks however the people from the store were OK , I only cannot understand why I got a set that was used and with a defective component , I sent an email to Amazon to report the problem no response , I had to look up the phone number of the seller , the item ( S ) itself was what I was looking for .. not a good experience  
2	  " The case is better than expected . Many cases offered provided protection for the DVD player , but this case went one step further and provided pockets for DVD media ( a cut down sun visor CD holder works good in the center pocket along with the remote ) , the DVD player pocket is well padded with velcro straps to hold the player secure and ear phones work good in the outer pocket . The case has an adjustable shoulder strap as well as a case handle . Excellent choice for anyone ! "  
2	  We bought this for use on Google Talk . The voice comes over clear and the background noise seems to be held to a minimum . Simply Plug and Play - no additonal software comes with it , nor is there a need for it . All you have to do is plug it in to the microphone jack ( sometimes conveniently colored pink ) on the back / front of your computer - it should start working imediatly . Mine came with two bases : one for your desk and one that you can stick to the side or top of your monitor ( or wherever . ) The cord is plenty long enough for you to be able to plug into a computer that may not be next to your monitor . It even comes with a short troobleshooting guide ( which could be useful for those that have NO experience finding the microphone volume on your computer . ) If you are looking for an inexpensive way to get your voice over the Internet , then I HIGHLY recommend this product . If you are looking for high-quality voice recording you may want to look for something more expensive . Minus one star for the desk stand . If you pivot the mic it tends to fall out of the stand ( which is weird because you have to push hard to get it back in . ) Not meant to be a true pivot point or moved around alot . Just set it and forget it .  
1	  I bought this for my son for his DS Lite and after a week , it was no longer charging his DS . Product is garbage .  
1	  My interest in this product was only to provide a high quality stereo audio link between a TV and amplifier - distance of only 20 feet . I never looked at the video transmission capability but found the audio link unacceptable due to interference from both a wireless telephone ( 800Mhz ) system and wireless LAN ( 801.11g ) also operating in the house . I returned the unit for refund .  
1	  these are some of the worse headphones i have tested the sound is horrible and tiny using an ipod touch no bass what so ever . i guess i have not learnt my lesson sony seems to have the best sounding headsets for this price range .  
1	  WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR : - Instead of buying many memory cards and / or lugging my laptop with me , I was hoping to offload my pictures quickly and continue to take more . My equipments include a Canon 20D ( taking RAW ) and a SanDisk Ultra II 2GB CF card . I wanted to be able to do this during a long day of wedding events and also on a week long vacation . Since I am not a professional photographer and do not have a profession budget , I couldn't really afford the Epson P-2000 that everyone loves for this application .. WHAT I GOT : I got the Flash-HD 's enclosure version for about $ 50 and supplied my own fast and reliable 30GB drive . A good deal that 's hard to beat , I thought . SETUP AND USAGE : The unit has no bells and whistles to speak of , It 's hard to be confused about it . I am an IT person . Installing the harddrive was straight forward . If your own drive is not already FAT32 formatted , you 'll need your own USB / drive connector to format it before you can use it in the unit . This unit does not boot if the drive is not already FAT32 . Once it 's set up , you simply plug the memory card in , push a couple of buttons , off it copies . No fuss . BUILD : It 's ok quality . I agree with the other review that the unit could be smaller . There is a dip / toggle switch that changes it betwen a USB drive and media card reader . That thing is unnecessarily tiny . SPEED : This is where it sucks big time . My 2GB card took 50 minutes to copy to the unit ! I clocked this both with the power plugged in and when on battery power . It 's SLOW and UNACCEPTABLE ! No two ways about it . My hope of not having to buy another card again was basically killed right there . BATTERY : I downloaded the full 2GB , took a break for 1 hour , and then tried download a second time . The battery died in 15 minutes ! This unit is a one-shot deal away from the outlet ! That 's just not going to cut it for me . USABILITY : 1 ) There is no way of verifying the copy job , 2 ) There is no way of seeing how much room is left , 3 ) When the job fails ( dead battery ) , you are stuck not knowing how much has been transferred and therefore how much you can delete from your card ! FINAL ANALYSIS : It 's light and cute and inexpensive . If you are only using it at the end of the day while on the road when power and time is no factor , I guess you can't beat this deal . But if you are hoping to use it as part of day of shooting , this puppy is going to be the critical path that stops your day DEAD ! You do get what you paid for with this one . Photography is not a cheap hobby . Sometimes one just has to face the truth and suck it up . I am returning mine . When I have enough cash someday , I am getting the Epson P-2000 ..  
1	  I ordered this item and then 30 minutes later went to cancel the order because JR dot com has it for cheaper with faster shipping . I was then told I couldn't cancel the order because it had already entered the " shipping process " but wasn't to be delivered until 1/16/07 ! I was told that I could refuse delivery but I would be charged a restocking fee and return shipping charges and won't get a refund for another 14 days after they receive the item back . Do yourselves a favor and order this and everything else from any other place then Amazon . com . These people are incompetent dumbasses !  
1	  1 . The left control key is in the wrong place , making it very frustrating to execute keyboard shortcuts like control-c , control-v for cut / paste . 2 . The touchpad is almost unuseable , with the cursor frequently jumping across the screen . 3 . The keyboard feels flimsy and cheap . In fact mine arrived with 2 keys that had fallen off in the mail and the springs underneath were nowhere to be found . I can put the keys back on , but they are useless without the springs . 4 . Adesso has appalling customer service . Don't expect your email to their service desk to be returned . Calling is not much better : twice , I waited the arrival of replacement springs , after customer service agents promised to send them to me . Its 3 months and I 'm still waiting .  
2	  I am a novice photographer but this camera is far and away the best camera I have ever owned .  
2	  I purchased this mouse about 9 months ago on Amazon . I believe it was one of the first mouses to feature the back / forward thumb buttons for web surfing ( I simply can't go back now ) . In all there are five buttons , more than enough for the average user . One disappointing thing was that none of the PC shooters I play lets me customize all 5 buttons . The optical " ball " is simply amazing . Reads on practically any surface and gets rid of the need for mouse pads and cleaning . There were however several problems I encountered while using this mouse . When I tried using the USB adaptor , the mouse would freeze my Windows 98 se environment within minutes of booting up . I tried everything I could to fix this but I had to revert back to using the PS2 connection . I read on a newsgroup that other people had the same problems and they returned the mouse for a replacement which fixed their problems . I haven't tried the mouse on any other system so I can't say for sure if it 's the mouse 's fault . This mouse is also the biggest I 've ever used . I have pretty big hands ( I can palm an NBA sized basketball ) , but this mouse gave huge hand aches for about a month . I don't think it 's actually the size of the mouse but the topside curvature which forced me to cup the mouse with the palm of my hand instead of using my fingers as with most other mouses . Also , reaching over to click on the thumb buttons added to the initial discomfort . Overall , I 'm happy with the mouse 's optical technology but the other issues prevent me from giving 5 stars .  
1	  The picture quality is very bad and the camera feels cheap compared to Canon and Fuji brands . This is a camera for poor people who can't afford a good brand . I would stick with a Japanese brand camera .  
2	  I got the best possible price on one of the best cameras on the market . Everything new , in box with peripherals . No problems .  
1	  i read other reviews for this product and so thats why i bought it .. however once i got it most of the channels have too much static . i am unhappy with this product .  
1	  Ah ! Tricky ! I order the battery . Time passes with no shipping notification from the vendor ( BargainCell ) . I call Amazon helpdesk . I 'm assured it 's all good . Today I get the order-cancellation email , 3 days * after * the battery is supposed to arrive . Reason ? " Out of stock " Stay away from these jokers .  
2	  I travel a lot and stay in many hotels that have only a wired hookup at the desk ( mostly international ) . This product frees me up from sitting only at the desk and , more importantly , adds another level of security for my computer . The instructions could be better as I had to finally get on the internet and search for more detailed instructions than what came with the unit . Once I set it up at home with the password and security , I took it on the road and it worked perfectly . Just plugged it in and my laptop hooked up automatically . A word of caution : When you put the modem back into the carrying case , it will cause the small switch on the bottom to switch from " Router " mode ( which is what you want in the hotel room ) to " Access Point AP " mode . This caused me some confusion when I first plugged it in at the first hotel I stayed in after setting it up at home . My laptop didn't see the network name I had given the router so I thought everything had dumped out of the router and I needed to go through the setup process again . After some troubleshooting I thought to check the small switch on the bottom and , that was the problem . I switched it back to router mode and it worked perfect . Great product . Very pleased .  
1	  Bought this memory for my wife 's laptop . At first , it seemed to work fine , but she started getting blue screen failure on a regular basis . Switched back to the old memory and everything was fine again . Can't recommend this memory .  
2	  These really are some great headphones , I have gone through a lot of different types , some more expensive than these . The sound quality is outstanding and the buds also stay in my ear when I work out .. which has been the biggest issue that I have had with other earbud type headphones . It is worth the few extra bucks for a great pair of headphones , and they have gotten cheaper since I first tried them out .  
1	  This was purchased to obtain the maps of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail . The AT is administrated and owned by the National Park Service , If so , then why is it not included in this map set ? Had I known this I would not have purchased this set of CDs . The description did not indicate that that 2175 mile long trail was not included .  
2	  Universal Serial Bus ( USB ) - and close on its heals , 1394 Firewire-has become the indispensable Personal Computer ( PC ) port connection for adding and or operating Plug-n-Play peripherals to your PC . Most computers now typically ship with at least two USB ports in the back and two in the front ; with some business class PC 's have four in the back and four in the front . I build my own computers for myself and my immediate family ; in fact I just build a new PC for my nieces and nephew . All of the newer motherboards and cases I have purchased of late have had at least two front USB connections , but alas my personal workstation which I build some three years ago lacks such accoutrements . But increasingly , I find myself utilizing more and more USB connected devices ; e.g. web cams , memory sticks , printers , external hard drive etc . , and continually having to dig behind my PC for an available USB connection is a inconvenientI currently have an internal PCI USB 2.0 card installed so , for months I have been searching for an internal USB version 2.0 hub for under $ 50.00 that would fit into a standard 3.5 ' or 5.25 " drive bay . Enter the " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub , " which combines four USB 2.0 with two 1394 Firewire connections . The " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub " is an easy-to-access device which can be installed in any available 3.5 or 5.25 " ( by using the included 5.25 " mounting rack ) device bay . However , one available 1394 port and / or an internal USB 2.0 port must be available in the computer to connect the " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub " via connections on the back of the unit . I assumed that the Firewire connections were standalone ; my assumptions were incorrect . The " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub " works with various types of USB 2.0/1.1 and 1394 devices including digital camcorder / cameras , external CD-RW / DVD-ROMs , MO drives , external hard drives , flash USB drives , memory sticks , USB memory modules , PC video cameras , memory card readers / writers etc . Installation : In order to install the " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub " you have a Pentium or equivalent computer with one available 3.5 " or 5.25 " device bay , and have Windows 98SE or later installed on your computer . The " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub " was simple to install ; the process took less then 10 minutes from start to finish , and no software is necessary , though the USB 2.0 card already installed in the computer must support a USB hub . In the box SIIG includes everything needed to get the hub up and running , including the following :* 3.5 " USB 2.0 + 1394 6-Port Bay Hub * 5.25 " mounting rack * Power Supply " Y " cable * Accessories set * USB cable * 1394 6- / 6-pin cable * User 's manualSince I do not have an existing 1394 card installed in my computer , I cannot address connections functionality . I installed the " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub " in an available 5.25 " drive bay , making sure to attach the ( included ) USB cable and power connections before securing the unit with mounting screws . Once in place I powered on the PC , and logged into Windows XP , which detected and installed the hub . I then inserted a LEXAR 128MB JumpDrive into the first slot ; no surprise , it works . First Impressions : " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub " works , and works well . Transferring data is swift and painless , and my only regret is that I could not test the speed of the 1394 port . The unit includes two lights beside each port , the upper indicating error , and bottom illuminate when a device is inserted . I found this out through trial and error , since the owners manual contains no information about the displays .  
1	  I wanted an iPod for years and finally bought one . I had already downloaded iTunes and burned 1700 of my favorite songs onto my laptop in AAC format , so when I bought the iPod I was all ready to load songs . Too bad the hard drive failed loading the songs . OK . Took to the Apple Genius who gave me a new one . It died too . Spent hours scanning the internet for fun tricks to try to get the stupid thing to work , but never could fix it . Never actually listened to a song on the damn thing so who knows what it sounds like . Apple did refund my money , but what do I do with the 1700 songs in AAC format ? I dread loading all those songs again !  
2	  I bought it , inserted into my pocket PC and it hasn't given me a hard time since then . That 's what i wanted .  
1	  Bought this in Aug . 2008 from Amazon before I moved to Worcester , MA so my wife could use it . New major road ( Rt . 146 just south of Worcester before the thruway exit ) diverted before I moved . The 360 doesn't know the new road and gets completely lost when I go through the area . Since it is a major road it is a pain going anywhere through this area . Even though the unit is only 6 months old Garmin doesn't allow me to update the map without paying for it . Even if I could though , the 2009 maps still don't have the correct routing for this road . Still , why don't they offer 1 year worth of free maps ? I bought the unit for $ 270 and 6 months later the price has dropped $ 100 . I am not spending ore money for outdated maps . As others have mentioned , acquiring maps is also way slower than the TomTom that I use . I also prefer the TomTom 's user interface better . TomTom has the arrow that shows you which way your turn will be whereas you have to click on the screen to view your next turn with the Garmin . This is a pain if you are on a multi-lane road in thick traffic .  
1	  I 'm on my 3rd Cruzer Mini now , after one died and cannot be recognized after 3 months of use , and its replacement gave me the " Insert Disk " message that other people have seen . Hits : small , slim design , fits in tight spaces , needs only LOW power and can be chained off an USB Hub . Good RMA policy & tracking process , though my first replacement was slow in coming , but the 2nd came in decent time . It comes with replacement plastic caps should you lose the original , though the replacments are just as easy to lose . Misses : Silly necklace-thing that came with it , durability & long-term reliability . We 'll see how long this will last . Performance is lower than some competitors . Take Away : We 'll see whether the Cruzer will outlast its warranty or not . SanDisk probably lost money on me with the holiday rebate and the 2 RMAs thus far . Advice to all : whether you have this or any other USB Flash Drive , MAKE BACKUPS !  
2	  Bandwidth on DSL is not enough ( ~ 5Mbps / ~ 1Mbps ) .. so I thought to add Wireless access as ClearWire service is available in my area . Unfortunately , Clearwire is also not that fast .. but additively , it would be much better . After much research on performance , features and cost , I chose this Dual-WAN router to solve my speed issues . I have been using it for several months now . It allows load-balancing based on traffic type , source IP address , destination IP address , and automatically on the internet traffic based on the declared WAN bandwidth values and the loads of each interface . It also has OpenVPN support , which I intend to use in the future . It is manageable from both firefox and internet exploder , but its numerous configuration options create lots of complexity which is suitable only for experienced network people . While this is not the most complex router in the industry , it does serve it intended purpose well and I would recommend it to anyone who is experienced with networking and who wants Dual-WAN access for redundancy , additive speed , or manageability from a single router .  
1	  I 'm a big fan of LaCie d2 drives . My problem with this item # 300685 is the fact that this is apparantly a discontinued mechanism , replaced by Lacie # 300719 , list price only $ 10 more ( $ 399 ) . One star rating awarded to Amazon , not LaCie . Current model product ( which I was hoping to buy , but cannot find on Amazon ) includes additional FireWire 800 Mbit / s interface , twice as fast as Firewire and USB 2.0 included with this drive . Amazon website is great for books , but fails to give technical specs on most computer items .  
1	  This is an awful t . v . Not long after we purchased it , it began to take longer and longer to turn on . We lived with it for quite some time . When it got to 45 minutes to turn on ( no exaggeration ) , we finally contacted Magnavox for a Magnavox approved repair shop . We took it in , they determined that it was the motherboard . It took 6-7 weeks for the motherboard to come in , and then they repaired it . We took it home , and about a week later a new problem ! Now , the t . v . turned on all right , but the screen was in black and white for about 30 minutes after turning it on . Back to the repair shop it went . They determined that it was the LCD controller . Again , 6-7 weeks for the part to come in . They put that new LCD Controller in , and it is STILL IN BLACK AND WHITE . Now they say it must be the panel . Gee , by process of elmination , that 's really all that is left ! Now I 'm being told that Magnavox may not cover the new panel . At this point , after all that we have spent with repair costs , we may as well have bought a new t . v . Not only is this a piece of junk television , but Magnavox 's " warranty " is a joke and they are sloow with costumer service . We have not had our television in our possession for nearly 4 months now because of their extremely slow parts delivery . We will never buy from Magnavox again .  
2	  After going through a few of those " free with the computer " type printers I finally bit the bullet and bought this Brother printer about 5 years ago . I love it . I have never had a problem with it and I got it up and running in a flash . I liked it so much that I bought a second one to have at my other home . The only reason I thought to finally do a review was that I was searching for where to buy toner for my oldest Brother printer . I can't recommend it highly enough . It 's so great - and so rare - to own any electronic device that doesn't get outdated in a few months , isn't quirky , performs perfectly and is easy to use . If you 're considering a b / w laser printer , you won't go wrong with this one .  
2	  I bought this filter mainly to use as a lens protector for an EF 100-400mm lens . I had concerns that while a good filter might not degrade the transmitted light too much for a shorter reach lens , that it nonetheless " might " have some negative effect on a light-starved longer reaching lens like this one . I did some indoor testing and saw a slight ( very slight ) amount of light loss , but no apparent loss of quality , or distortion . I shot a lot of outdoor shots , and saw no discernable loss of transmitted light , nor any noticeable impact to image quality . The weather has been uncooperative for testing its haze reduction effectiveness on long landscape shots though .. After shooting a lot of shots in the rain WITHOUT the filter , and then having to carefully clean the water spots off the front lens element , I decided this filter needs to live on the front of my lens , unless I am shooting with a polarizer or other filter . The long lens hood on the EF 100-400mm ( ~ 3.5 " of protection ) should be enough for most unplanned events , but won't help with blowing sand or dust . And who can say when I might have to shirt-tail ( horror ! ) some spray off the front of the lens some day if I find myself without a lens cloth ?  
1	  I don't know what people are raving about . The picture quality on this thing is absolutely horrible . I can see a better picture without my glasses than wearing glasses looking at a picture taken with this camera . I dont know the techy term but I think its called noise or lens aberation or something . I know its not a quality german lens like zeiss , or nikon or canon , but this camera i just horrible . Maybe ok for your 6 year old kid .  
2	  The Nano is just what I wanted and needed . Mostly I utilize it for podcasts . I have had one problem of the Nano freezing and I have needed to " reboot " about 4 or 5 times . A bit annoying , but no true problem .  
2	  I have had two of these Samsonite brief cases through my 27 years in the home building business and I can tell you they hold up very well . They have been vwery functional and have an impressive style . Very tough exterior .. DDC  
1	  I had this charger kit for my 3g ipod and purchased one for my wife when I bought her 4th gen . ipod . It didn't work . The seller told me it doesn't work with the 4th gen . I believe the seller should make this know in his adv .  
1	  I received this item for Christmas and it only worked for a few months before the screen went black . I called polaroid and they basically said Too bad the warranty is up ( 90 days ! ) , but for $ 110 . we can replace it .. what so that it can happen again after another few months . I took it to a repair shop ( mind you it worked for only 6 months maybe ) and they said it needed a new display assembly board but polaroid does not / will not sell internal repair parts . What a waste of money ! We replaced it with a Sony they have a much better warranty . We will NEVER buy from Polaroid again . Who expects a 90 warranty on a television , I expected Polaroid to back their product better than this .  
2	  With 2 toddlers , I 'm the type of person who likes to have a camera with me to capture those unexpected moments on film . The ELPH cameras are ideal for this because they 're small and lightweight . I used a 3.2MP Canon ELPH before this one , and I thought the 3.2 was good until I started using this new one . The clarity and stability control on the SD700 is great ! And downloading the photos to my computer takes only seconds . I highly recommend this camera .  
1	  The metal docking plug of this Cyber Acoustics docking speaker did not fit smoothly into my iPod Touch ( 1st gen ) . I had to forcibly jam them together to make them fit . Removing the iPod also took quite a bit of force . I was concerned that repeatedly forcing my iPod into the Cyber Acoustics docking speaker would damage the iPod . So I returned the Cyber Acoustics docking speaker to Amazon . If a docking speaker is designed correctly , an iPod should fit into it quite smoothly . I have previously fit my iPod into other types of docking speakers , and the fit was always smooth . The problem here was not with the plastic adaptor ( for the iPod Touch ) supplied with the Cyber Acoustics docking speaker . My iPod Touch fit easily into that adaptor . Rather , the problem was with the metal docking plug , which failed to fit smoothly , with or without the adaptor .  
2	  This thing is great for removing those pesky dust particles that are attracted by static . It will also remove a considerable amount of static itself surprisingly . It wont however , remove finger prints and other heavy grime like that so a wet cleaning would be in store for that . I have owned this brush for about 9 months and it has held up just fine . I didn't have any of the fibers falling out lie some reviewers had said . I take care of mine though . I don't touch the bristles as i know they are very delicate . For the price I am very happy with my purchase !  
1	  Do not use if you want HD , 3D , or 1080i or 1080p . I looked at the pictures when i purchased 6 of these . I started laughing when i opened the DHL / USPS bag . Started sdhipping DHL then they turned it over to the U.S. post office to ship it from Kentuky to me . Maybe DHL got lost . Anyway .. these cables are not very high quality . Actually quality is not a word i should use with these at all . These cables are hdmi true . They are not shielded . And one of the cables out of the bag did not work correctly . The video is now horizontaly challanged . Go to Wal-Mart they have good cabled on sale for 10.00 that are 3D , Reverse Audio , and Network . Now that is not a bad deal . I did get what I paid for . Low class hdmi cables . I know better but was in a hurry . Here is a link to HDMI 1.4 standards [ .. ]  
1	  Veryy cheaply made . I have a mustang and it wouldn't even read this thing . it would just keep skipping back between tape and radio or track 1 and track 2 . And a couple of times when I put the adapter in there it wouldn't register at all so i couldn't even get it out ! defintely not buying from this seller again ..  
1	  it takes a lot of time to mold to the keys and it slows you down while you type . You have to press the keys much harder ; and you 're more likely to make typing mistakes . I don't recommend it . Save yourself the aggravation .  
2	  Thanks to vendors like this , I continue to buy online . It 's exactly how it should be .. the item 's price is reasonable , it 's shipped right away , and we become a happy customer once again !  
2	  First let me say I have straight hair so use a brush dryer to smooth out my hair and give a little curl at the end . I 'm not trying to create big curls . I 've used brush dryers for years . I think this is my third or fourth one . I just bought the Conair BC171 to replace a similar ( non Ionic ) version that has been a workhorse for years . I think I had my other one at least 5 years - maybe longer . It 's still working but the bristles have seen better days . After years of very faithful service , it needed replacing . When I knew i had to replace my old one , I first bought another Conair at Target . But it had NO POWER . It was about like having someone blow on your hair . I returned it . Then , I bought a similar looking Revlon dryer . But it allows most of the hot air to blow out at the bottom of the brush attachment with very little air to actually style / dry your hair . Then the attachment quit staying in place and would come out in my hand . So , another brush dryer returned . At this point , I 'm seriously hoping I can find a Conair like the one I had . Searched Amazon and boom - there it is . I 'm so thrilled . This one is just the right size barrel - it allows you to kinda grab your hair and style it . It has plenty of power to get the job done . And I really like the combo plastic and bristle brush attachment . For me , it works the best . I 'm not big on leaving loong product reviews but i figure there are other women out there frustrated just like I was .  
2	  I like accessories that are functional and really work as they were intended and designed . Such is the case with this product . It holds CDs securely and safely . There is also room for accompanying booklets , manuals and the like . This CD Wallet is well thought out , functional and very durable .  
2	  I have had my first SC101 for about 2 weeks now and have found it to be a great help in storing and accessing files from many different computers on our home network . I like the feature of being allowed to control the size of the NAS ( Network Attached Storage ) device by using common and relatively cheep IDE drives . I also like the ability to either have both drives available to store files or protect these files with a mirror . Finally I like the speed you get with this NAS . I had purchased the Linksys NSLU2 a few years ago , but with the limitation of USB 1 . X speeds and the Linux based OS on the file server , it was quite limiting . With the SC101 I am able to setup briefcases and access any file from any system on our home network . There are a few comments I have for the SC101.1 . The proprietary software to connect to the NAS device . It is DHCP and very limited on the configuration of the NAS for advanced users . 2 . The software that connects the computer to the NAS device rather than the usual practice of mapping a drive . I have found this method to be good for novice users , but somewhat unreliable over wireless networks . When the drive drops off , it usually requires a reboot of the computer to get connected . 3 . Wireless access is nice for normal use , but not very good when copying large files or large number of files . This is best done on a wired connection . I had many instances where the proprietary drive would drop off and would require a reboot to reconnect . 4 . File access times either over wireless or wired network is acceptable . When first accessing the NAS , there is a few second delay , but after that the files are acceptably accessible . I have been able to view video over a wireless connection with no issue to speak of . Improvements1 . I think Netgear should make improvements to the driver as well as how advanced users could have more control in configuring this device .  
2	  I am still off the cable tv grid and not too far from the broadcast towers . But I am in a bit of a valley that can cause reception problems . I have tried a couple of the electric powered rabbit ears from Radio Shack and Philips and wasn't all that satisfied with them . This antenna doesn't need power and does as well as or a little better than the powered rabbit ears . It is a lot easier to deal with . I use it for a small tv in the kitchen where I can move it around if I need to . It won't solve your tough reception situations and isn't as good as a well placed outdoor or attic antenna , but it is a better than the rabbit ears .  
1	  I couldnt go more then 50 feet before losing total RX and TXI even upgraded the antenna and gained maybe 10 feet :( Its got a great look but not what i expected at all :(  
1	  My signal strength went from 86-88 to 87-89 . Not worth the electricity it uses . And what is up with the RG59 cables ? Anybody who is serious about signal quality will only use RG6 . It is being sent back for a refund .  
1	  in my opinion , this product simply does not work . i am reluctant to give it one star , but i guess that 's my only option . to begin with , i am constantly being kicked off line only to pick up my phone and hear a dial tone . the manual says this problem is due to surges in the phone line . it happens often and is REALLY annoying . but on the other hand , if someone tries to call while i am online , about half the time they simply here a busy signal . and yes , i do have call waiting . finally , i have had this product for about 2 months now and this week it just died on me . no indicator lights are lit and i am unable to fax through it or receive calls while online . save your money , or better yet get DSL .  
1	  I 've had the linksys for 3 weeks now , and after spending several hours myself trying to set it up , I brought it to the office and had an IT person work on it . He has been unable so far to get it working properly . I 'm not a technical person , and I would just warn those of you who are similar to myself , that unless you have technical friends who can help you thru the setup process , you might consider going with a different product . The setup CD was WORTHLESS !  
1	  Plugged my 2.5mm headset into one end and the pink into my laptop 's mic in and green into laptop 's headphones input . DID NOT WORK EITHER FOR MIC OR HEADPHONES . After reviewing laptop settings , etc . finally happened to plug the green ( which is headphones ) into the mic input and the mic now worked ! Only problem is that the pink into headphones did not give me sound . So , it 's miss-wired or just screwed up . I am returning it today . Also note that compared to the new one I bought ( here on Amazon , see my other review ) , the wires in this adapter are very thin and the connectors small .  
1	  Please , don't buy from this seller . I 've sent e-mails to three different addresses trying to get an answer from them and have not heard back . First , the cartridge they sent was damaged upon arrival . A piece was broken off that allows the cartridge door to open when the printer is closed . Luckily , I still had my old cartridge and was able to switch the doors and have it physically working again . But the cartridge won't print correctly . After some research , I 've found it 's probably got a bad corona wire in it . The irony of it all is they include a card with the cartridge begging you to contact them rather than leave less than 5 stars . Never again .  
1	  Actually I LOVE the e-go , It 's the company support that is lacking . I read the negative reviews and can totally understand . My ego came under supplied but I did the math and figured if I bought a 2nd the cost of the flash alone would be equal . In doing so I have recieved all that I should have . I did notice one of the very favorable reviews here has the same name of person who responded to my negitive feed back before I think people should know they 're review from MICHEAL PITCHER was from the VICE PRESIDENT of the i2GO company he gave me numerouse phone nos . however will not respond via e-mail .. and I will not call as the item is only available on line so should the comunication line be .  
1	  the laptop only recognizes it as a usb 2.0 . the actual speed is no faster than usb 1.1 . I 've tried burning dvds , uploading flash drives and ipods . the device did not accomplish the job any faster than my usb 1.1 . maybe i don't have the right driver . in which case , the driver cd they include also sucks . it is nothing more than a compilation of all of the possible drivers that work for this specific hardware . difficult to figure out which driver is the right one . also , the ac adapter is not included . the power plug included has a usb plug at the end . you 'd have to use one of your own usb to power the darned thing . if i am the one at fault for not using the device friendly , then these people are at fault for not being user friendly .  
2	  I am a bit perplexed by the odd reviews this camcorder has gotten .. Personally , I am very happy with mine .. no real problems .. of course , I don't profess to be a geek ..  
1	  While I knew the flash drive I bought was a used one , it arrived containing the former owners data , some personal , and also had a missing part of its slide essential for inserting it into the computer UBS slot .  
1	  This product does exactly the opposite of what it is supposed to do : It is supposed to clean screens . Instead , it leaves heavy streaks that are nearly impossible to get rid of . Isn't that the definition of a bad product ? The people giving this product positive reviews are either paid shills or blind . Stay away at all costs . You 've been warned .  
2	  i got it for $ 1.61 and i use it for my xbox so that i don't have to use the input form my cable box and have to switch the cable back and forth whenever i 'm done . for my purposes 6 feet was defiantly enough as well  
1	  I bought these for a customer 's Dell PowerEdge 860 server , and they did not work in the machine even though it takes PC2-5300 DDR2 RAM . The server won't boot and throws a beep and LED code during POST which indicates a memory error . I do not know whether the problem is with these particular DIMMs , this model of DIMM , or the server itself . I will be returning these to Amazon and replacing them with memory from Crucial at the customer 's request .  
2	  This is my first prime lens , and my second lens purchase , and it was exactly what I was looking for . If you 're just starting out in photography and haven't shot with a prime before , it 's an experience I 'd recommend ( removing the zoom forces you to think about where you 're standing and makes me more inclined to fiddle with other features which have a larger impact in the resulting photos ) . The low f-stop is absolutely fantastic for shooting photos in real world indoor lighting situations . The only negative thing I have to say about this lens is that it has no IS , but that seems to be the norm for < 300 mm prime lenses .. the lack of IS causes me a bit of a headache when I 'm trying to shoot in low light without a tripod and want to ensure I 've got my subject in sharp focus .  
1	  I was unable to use this DVD drive and had to return it because the tray is too wide . Most DVD drives give you about a 1/2 " clearence on the sides , but this tray gos compeletely to the edge . Once I put the case back on the computer , the tray could not eject . If they would redesign the tray to be more compatible with Dell PC 's and others , then this would be a good drive .  
1	  Just resting my thumbs on the space bar causes repeated spaces to be typed . Seriously , I don't even have to press the space bar , just touch it , or breath on it . At first I thought my keyboard was possessed and I could barely type anything legible . I also have problems with letters and keys being repeated , even though my fingers are off the keyboard . The delete key has this behavior as well , which has caused me to inadvertently 5-10 emails until the delete button decides to unpress itself . I give up !  
1	  I use Windows 7 Home Edision 64 bit . After lots of effort , the connection is still on and off . Besides , the company technical support has little help .  
1	  Great monitor but I ordered one from Amazon , it had a bad pixel . I sent it back and the replacement had a bad pixel , too . Amazon has been good but my opinion of NEC / Mit . has plummeted . Where 's the quality control ?  
2	  Though a little big for point and shot cameras of 2010-2011 . but the quality of this product is really nice . I am carrying sony cybershot wx-9 , its charger , usb cable and extra memory card in this case and still a little space is left .  
1	  I bought this drive to use on both PC and Mac , and paid extra for double layer and lightscribe capabilities . After fiddling with it for 2 days , I am returning it . It is as slow as my old DVD writer ( internal ) at copying movies from my hard drive ( appears to be 1x ) . The tech support is lousy ( not toll-free , and busy all the time ) , the enclosed software difficult to use , and all in all I am extremely disappointed . I am a computer trainer by profession , so I figure if I can't use it , a lot of other people won't be able to either . Don't bother unless you want to beat your head against a wall all night trying to get it to work .  
1	  I just got a ReplayTV for my second television . ( I already got a TiVo for my big screen-but I wanted a second digital recorder because you need one for each TV ) . I gotta say the ReplayTV is incredible . Is it as incredible as my TiVo ? Well , yes . And I think I like it a tad more because Replay doesn't charge the monthly fee I pay with TiVo . Also , TiVo doesn't have the QuickSkip button that Replay has . This is the BEST for zipping through time outs , boring stuff and lousy commercials . I also find Replay 's channel guide interface easier than TiVo . Replay 's is like my cable channel guide-so it 's easier to use . TiVo 's is based on shows and is a little more confusing . I guess that at the end of the day , I LOVE THEM BOTH ( how could I not love something that makes television totally fun and easy to record ? ) . But I love Replay a little more . My next goal is to get a WebTV system for my third ( and last ) TV .  
1	  I don't know who in the real world averages 5 % coverage , which is Canon 's spec for getting 2000 prints out of this unit . So you can't believe you 'll get anywhere near 2000 prints . I 've been averaging about 600 . I love my MF4270 printer and get great quality prints , but the toner life is completely unacceptable .  
2	  This is my first GPS so I did lots of research on the web to figure out which was the best one for me . The first step was to decide how much I wanted to pay which was no more then $ 200 . The second step was to decide on features . I knew I wanted the GPS loaded with maps of both the USA and Canada , some systems don't come with maps of Canada unless you purchase them . The next feature I wanted was turn by turn with text to speech as I liked the idea of hearing the street names as I approached them . I also wanted a GPS that was rated as very accurate and fast . As for additional features like MP3 and picture viewer , thought it would be neat , but not essential . I began my research at CNET , Amazon , Best Buy and Circuit City plus a few other sites on the net I can't remember now . I read their reviews and also the reviews of the folks who actually bought the devices . I came down to the choice between the Garmin c580 and Garmin c550 . The difference was that the c580 had MSN Direct services free which gives you local gas prices , real time traffic and movie times free for a year . Otherwise I could find no real difference . The price at the time I purchased the c580 was only a few dollars more . Now where I live there is no MSN coverage , but when I went to Las Vegas I had coverage and down in the southern part of Maine there is coverage . I have no plans to extend my membership once it expires . I have really liked the GPS as I have found it extremely accurate . The MP3 player works well , but because of the size of speakers , not really that great to listen to music . The display and voice are very clear . It has Blue tooth functionality . The screen size is 3.5 in which is right for me . I would recommend this GPS as very good . My only recommendation before you buy a GPS is to do your research and read the reviews of the folks who purchased it to get a good general sense of the product .  
2	  You may wan't to know this : Card is fine , but many laptop readers don't support > 2GB , so you have to use camera and USB-cable to get 8GB .  
1	  noise on the receiver , touch lamp goes off and on when on phone , phone rings when talking on other phone  
2	  After 1 year and 2 months of serious playtime for DVD 's and CD 's my player died in the middle of a movie and subsequently will no longer play any more or recognize any disc inside it . just the pathetic noise it makes as it tries to start the discs to no avail . I know what this means . SONY has ( .. ) me again . Thats 2 SONY CD players to have the pickup laser die on me . But you know what , the picture and enjoyment was so great in the time that I owned it , I 'm upgrading to the new SONY DVP-NS400D and praying that it lasts longer this time . 4 stars becaue the damn thing died in a little more than year after what I would estimate as 300 hours of usage .  
1	  The sound was great with these headphones . However , the fit was horrible . They hurt my ears so much that I had to quite using them after trying them on three different occasions and return them .  
2	  this system is perfect if you like loud base and want alot of power out of your speakers . But these speakers aren't as clear as it i thought it would be from reading the reviews . i had a BOSE Companion 2 and i think those speakers sounds better than these , but they do lack base and loudness . but overall i am pretty satisfied with these ..  
1	  I agree with the two previous reviewers . There needs to be a user manual and there isn't one . The fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees . This isn't very helpful for star gazing . The maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches . This is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing . Celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together .  
2	  Those of us paying tuition really don't usually have money to throw around at non-essentials , like an expensive hard drive based mp3 player that houses our entire music collection . As cool as that would be , we 're talking about shelling out ( at the very least , for a used model ) between $ 200 & $ 300 . So what can we do ? Consider the Creative MuVo Mircro N200 .. starting at just $ 65 . And it does so much more than just play your music . Think about a USB flash drive that will not only allow you to carry your assignments and important documents around with you , but will also play any mp3 or wma song stored on it . In addition , listen to FM radio , record from the radio , and store hours of lectures and voice using the built in mic . Oh yeah , you 'll do all that for under $ 70 . The 256 MB ( approx . 18 hours of voice recording time or 4.5 hours of music ) model sells at Amazon . Com for $ 65 . If you have the extra cash , upgrade to the 512 MB or 1GB model . This reviewer bought the 512 MB version at Amazon . Com for $ 109 only to discover the 1GB model at the highly rated B & H Photo Video online store ( bhphotovideo . com ) for $ 104.95 a few days later . Yes , I 'm kicking myself . Here 's the nitty gritty . Aesthetics / Usability : Beautiful device . It 's stylish , yet inconspicuous . Only three buttons and a rocker switch make it incredibly easy to use disconnected from your computer , and the fact that it requires no special software to load files makes it as simple as using a traditional USB flash drive . 5/5 stars in that department . Features : This device is jam packed . Along with what has been previously mentioned , this Mp3 player can also record from any other audio source via a line in jack directly to mp3 format . This opens up the possibility of using an external microphone for voice recordings , etc . Four onboard EQ presets ( Rock , Jazz , Classical , and Pop ) as well as the ability to create custom 5 band EQ configurations give fantastic sound quality . Unfortunately , there is no way to adjust the recording quality when using the built in mic , which only allows for mediocre recordings . 4.75/5 starsTechnical Specs : The entire unit is virtually weightless at 0.8 ounces and is only 2.6 inches by 1.3 inches , with depth of only one half inch . This thing will go anywhere you want it to . When the backlight is engaged , there is faint but slightly noticeable sound that can be distracting . Creative says this can be corrected via a firmware update available at creative . com . Battery life is at least 15 hours on one AA size battery . 4.75/5 starsIncluded Accessories : An armband , stereo headphones , optional music management software , one AA battery , a line in cable , a USB cable , and a very cool molded rubber carrying case with a belt clip are all included in the box . This is pretty much an unparalleled accessory package . 5/5 starsFinal Rating : After taking into account aesthetics , usability , features , technical specifications , and the accessories included with the product , it has been given a final average rating of 4.88 out of 5 stars . Excellent .  
1	  I bought this thing at a department store than focuses on clothing , and that should have been my first clue . As several others have written . WHEN this thing works , it works ok . HOWEVER , all too often it refuses to read the DVD . It will display " Wrong Disk " , " Data Error " , or as is most often the case , it will just whirl and clunk , tick like a time-bomb , and than whirl and clunk some more . Sometimes , it will read parts of a multi-section DVD , and not others . And the operations : The remote AND the buttons of the machine itself are all very confusing , and difficult to operate . The main part on the unit being this small circular disk that you have to press the correct part of , juust right , and sometimes hold down , other times press repeatedly ( and rapidly ) , or it ends up doing the wrong thing . Now , I 'm not a no0b . I am in fact a television production specialist with 10 years in the business . In my opinion this thing is a piece of junk .  
2	  Very pretty and good computer case , you can change the front fans and move them to the bottom or upper levels , and the fans have a velocity regulators , and the 200 mm fan on the up side it really get out the heat , and also ahve a regulator , the only issue that i found is that it doesn't have a speaker , so you never will find out the " Errors sounds " of the mobo had , even though it is very good  
2	  Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control for Nikon D40 , D40x , D60 , D80 & D90 Digital SLR CamerasThis product is great to use and the price was even better . The reviews I read previously really helped me to see what the capabilities of this product are .  
1	  Prior to buying the TV we had a 27 " CRT TV that lasted 19 years . So we decided to buy a new TV since it was getting old . So in 1/17/2004 we bought a 40 " Projection TV ( R40W46 ) with a 2 years extended warranty . The TV has been performing great and we have been very happy with it until just last week when we noticed " blue shadows " all over the screen . After looking over the manual and adjusting the convergence , no success . To fix this TV outside of its warranty will cost over $ 1,000 dollars , and with prices on TV 's dropping it makes no sense to send it in for repair . It has basically become a disposable TV . We are very disappointed that our TV has only lasted 3 years . I 'm sending it to Goodwill . I 'm very disappointed that Zenith will not stand behind their products . My only mistake was not researching Zenith TVs prior to buying since I had full faith in the brand . I found other people on the internet with the same exact problem ! I 'm sorry to say this was my last Zenith TV .  
1	  EXPECTATION : A full featured TV tuner to be used with a HD monitor . REALITY : A glorified DTV tuner , much like the $ 50 units offered with the exception of an HDMI , Toslink & RGB output . PROS : It provides a quality video output . CONS : Weak line level audio output performance , WIll not receive SD cable broadcast , Very slow startup , Only controlled from the remote , Weak menus for channel setup & very slow channel learning . This product did not do what I expected nor does it preform well . In particular , the line level audio output is not very good at all . Compared to my Samsung LCD , the line level audio output to a known good audio system seems flat sounding . The bigger disappointment is it does not include a SD receiver . I 'd planned to use this tuner to connect my 42 " monitor to my local cable service for the basic cable services I receive . I was disappointed to find It will only receive the clear QAM channels Comcast offers ( not very many here ) and non of the standard broadcast provided by Comcast . The results is I really don't receive much more than I would over the air locally and what I get through the cable does not include any programing info ( thanks Comcast ) . I also don't like the idea of only being able to control it from the remote . with out the remote it becomes a paper weight and is rendered useless . The menus and channel setup is also very annoying . you can not add channels without first going through the very low learning of all the channels within range . ( not a very good design that seems to run throughout the Samsung product line ) Lastly , it takes a while to boot up every time I turn it on . it 's a little anoying because it 's in a location that I can't see the power light . Often times I end up hitting the power button on the remote several times not knowing if it 's booting up or not . Seems a little odd it takes up to 5 seconds before any audio or video output comes from it . I plan to eventually use the Toslink output with the hopes of better audio performance . It 's an ok performer but not at all what I expected . Although the selection of digital tuners are very small , If I knew what I know now , I don't think I would have purchased this unit .  
1	  I had a Hewlett Packard 540 printer from 1994 and that works better than the 1300 . I have put 20 year old pieces of paper , used , recycled , and I never had a problem with the 540 that I do with a 1300 . I work in a school office and I have had nothing but problems with removing jammed paper . If it 's stuck somewhere and you need to remove it , but it is impossible without damaging the rollers to prevent the paper jam in the machine . Somehow I think Hewlett Packard lost its way in making printers . Since I work in an office , it is impossible to really depend on the 1300 printer for assurance . Once there is a jam and a crackling sound , get ready to buy a new printer . It is very important for people who design printers to place emphasis on using recycable paper and the printer 's longevity . For now , I have a 540 at home which has lasted over 10 years without needing service . There tells me something is wrong with this picture when an old printer like 540 is better than a 1300 ten years later . Something is wrong with the price . I would not spend so much money on a printer that will break after a few months . If you need a dependable productive printer , this is thenot one .  
1	  I got this mouse because the wire on the mouse that came w / my laptop was a little too short to reach throught the wire manager at the back of my desk & back up to the keyboard tray . Unfortuantely this mouse can't seem to get decent reception at this distanc . The straightline distance is 3 to 4 feet , with the desk surface in between . The performance is exceedingly choppy ( useless ) . The mouse works OK when I move it up onto the desk , but if I wanted it this close I wouldn't need a wireless mouse . I might use it when travelling , but it is worthless in my office .  
1	  I had JVC product and some of my friends too . These are good at the begining and after an year the motors will have problem and also the tape heads will have problem . Even the cable pins will wearout easaly and will not work properly . Price may be less buy its not worth for long run . I feel Sony and Canon are better than JVC . Even Hitachi is good .  
1	  Although you can still buy SmartMedia at many locations as well as directly from PNY , PNY considers it to be an obsolete product and no longer honors their " lifetime warranty " . Since PNY currently considers " lifetime " to be the commercial life of a specific product and will not offer any alternate compensation for defective " obsolete product " , I cannot recommend purchasing any PNY product .  
2	  As a Mac user who favors still photography , I do like to take bits of video here and there , and this fits the bill perfectly . Have only taken video indoors so far and I 've found the video quality to be perfectly adequate ( no faces hidden in the shadows ) . Sound is fine , too . The software included functions fine on my Mac ( although I think you have to have the camera plugged in to see video you 've stored on your computer ) . Have also imported the AVI files into iMovie easily .  
1	  The cable seems to be very sensitive . I had a cable prior that was lost and it worked perfectly so I do not believe it is the computer . But it does not always recognize and a touch can cause a lost connection . Bad buy .  
1	  TheEmerge Technologies Retractable Universal Notebook Charger ( ETCHGNBW ) is a product that has some usefulness when it works . Unfortunately , it disappoints in too many key areas to be worth recommending . Long term use has revealed that this unit is simply not durable enough , nor is it designed well enough , to be used as a primary power adapter . There are a few reasons why anybody would want to purchase a universal laptop charger . 1 . To replace a lost OEM charger2 . To use for travel3 . To use as a backup for several different laptops4 . Some combination of the aboveUnfortunately , this unit is really only good for the third purpose as a backup . It has a good compatibility range to make it an adequate backup for a variety of laptops . I tested it with a variety of HP and Acer laptop models . But it also has too many design flaws to be used as a replacement for your OEM charger or as a travel unit for several laptops . PROS : + Compatible with many laptop models and brands , particularly older ones + Included storage pouch makes it easy to keep all the pieces together and minimize the odds of losing tips + Nice length of 9.5 feet when fully extended + Retractable cabling makes it compact for transport + 9 included adapter tips + Additional tips are available + Standard 2 prong plug may be preferred by some , but comes with drawbacks ( see CONS ) CONS : - Tips do not fit securely , providing intermittent power - Matching compatible tips to your devices is a trial and error process - Overall build quality and durability appear to be poor - Cable detaches from the power adapter brick too easiy - Other half of the cable is permanently tethered to the adapter brick - Cord retractor gets stuck too easily and wears quickly - Cords tend to get tangled and twisted when extended - Newer laptops not always compatible and sometimes require replacement tips - Unit has limited power options - Plug is non-groundedCONCLUSIONThere are many alternatives that are more attractive than this unit when judged on cost or build quality . This unit does have a wide compatibility range , but that still does not include a large number of laptops . This is potentially useful as a backup , but only once you have confirmed you can get compatible tips for all your devices . Enjoy .  
1	  When I use this MP3 , I had many problems with it . Here are the problems : 1 . It freezes too much . ( Even on the first day I used it ) 2 . It has a slow response . 3 . When I reset the Zen , it decreases performance . 4 . It shakes to much . 5 . If accidentally dropped , makes the reader for the disk busted . 6 . It is a disk type MP3.7 . The processor is sluggish . These are the things that makes it bad . But there are actually some good feature that are very awesome . 1 . Big capacity . 2 . Good resolution screen . 3 . Microphone ( The cause of freezing ) 4 . Long battery life . 5 . Lots of featuresAs you can probably see , the cons outweigh the pros . This MP3 is a must-not buy .  
2	  What can I say other than it 's new , in a bag , works and hasn't caused any problems . The price was reasonable too !  
1	  There 's nothing " wrong " with this product , but I don't like it . I bought it because it stated it is narrow enough to use on planes or buses . The truth is , it 's not . It 's also pretty heavy and I had bought it because I have a bad neck and need something I can roll behind me instead of carrying it . I 've gone back to a carrying bag rather than use this one .  
2	  I have had the Netgear RT314 router for over 3 YEARS and have had NO PROBLEMS with it whatsoever . The router has been very stable through tons and tons of use . I was very unfamiliar with networking when I bought this router , and the installation was simple ( just follow the instructions EXACTLY ! ) . I highly recommend this product . Firewall , DHCP , and LAN all in one . Great item ! I have used this router ( internet-wise ) for both cable internet access and wireless internet access . Note : Remember to tape your username and password to your router . I forgot to and it took me some time to find this info to get into my router .  
1	  This is without a doubt , the worst printer I have ever purchased . I bought this one to use on my HP computer , as I use a Photosmart 1115 with my Power Mac G4 and it is excellent . I figgured the extra inking would be better on the PC . WRONG . So I tried it on the Mac , it is SLOWER . It runs about 1 page per minute and a half . A color photo takes 5 minutes , and this is a small 4x6 print . I 'll keep the 1115 . It has better photo quality also . AND , the smart card reader is also slow . The 1115 reads the same photos in 1/10 th the time . I will never recommend this printer to anyone .  
2	  I did a lot of research on Amazon when I decided to get a scanner . I read many , many reviews and finally picked this one . I 'm very happy with it , I 'm glad to say . I use it primarily to increase or decrease pictures so that I can trace them onto my quilt tops - very user friendly in that area anyway . I can even get fat books to scan ! : 0 ) Thanks , I 'm very pleased with this scanner !  
2	  Bought this because my old linksys A / B / G router 's range pooped out far too soon . Installation was simple , the design is a bit sleeker than my old router . Range saw a pretty dramatic improvement , I 'd estimate about 3x . What used to be on the very fringe of recieving any signal now gets a respectable 36 Mbps , certainly enough to get maximum bandwidth from my 3.0 Mbps cable internet connection . I haven't purchased any Pre-N cards as of yet due to their expense , but things are just fine with my old A / B / G cards .  
1	  This keyboard is OK - much better than my old worn out one but the mouse is not responsive enough . Very draggy . Wish it was better . I use this combo of keyboard and mouse as I have limited space . I plug it into my laptop . I probably should rate it as 2.5 stars .  
2	  I payed for the code and 2 minutes later .. BAM got my code .. now im playing marvel vs capcom 2  
2	  Especially at Christmas time , the labeler comes in very handy and these wider labels are especially good for card addressing , etc . Recommended .  
1	  I have 3 of these units . Within a short time , two of the power supplies have gone bad . The first symptom was that the drives were suddenly dismounting randomly . Finally the computer would not recognize the drives at all . Swapping the power cables with the remaining good one did make the drive function properly again . Unfortunately , having to constantly order replacement power cables ( at around $ 20 each or so ) was not part of the deal . So avoid this product .  
1	  I loved this iron when it arrived . The price was right , it heated really fast , everything appealed about it . I used it less than two months , 10 times at most if that , and it quit heating on me . The light turns on , and that is about it . Now it is more than 30 days , I doubt I can return it . :(  
1	  These cables are junk , short in Left channel cable fresh out of package-cutting in and out with horrible crackling sound and finally quit altogether . Go with the Hosa version .  
2	  I 've had these binoculars for 3 years and use them for bird watching . Love them . Fantastic glass and the image stabilization works like a charm . I ended up buying two more for my parents and they also love them and won't take any trip without them . They do a good job gathering light on dark and dreary days and focus very easily . I have had no problems with them , and I 'm pretty tough on equipment . I 've owned many binoculars in my lifetime and have always had a problem with glass in either one of the tubes " slipping " and not being able to focus through both eyes simultaneously . I haven't had a single problem with these , and I 've dropped them several times . I highly recommend these binoculars .  
1	  Have had the Samsung P421 for about a year an a half . 10 months into ownership it began pausing occasionally and randomly in the middle of a DVD , then either skipping or stopping entirely with the " Disc will not play message . " Initially I attributed this to to a disc that was dirty or damaged , but when cleaning a disc didn't help and it did it as well with clean DVDs that played satisfactorily on other players , I realized the player was at fault . As time has gone on it 's gotten worse , and now it displays this problem on at least 70 % of the DVDs played and refuses to play through about 15 % of the DVDs . Much too unreliable or short-lived to recommend . Too bad , because a number of its features are excellent .  
1	  I ordered 5 cables . Two out of the five did not work . One cable had a misaligned column of pins on one end of the cable so naturally I could not make a connection . The other cable connected just fine but would lose video when I tap on the cable or if the monitor or PC was bumped . Very poor workmanship . But the worst part of the whole ordeal was the process of getting a refund . It cost me five dollars and change to ship the cables ( which I was never refunded ) . After seven back and forth emails and almost 3 weeks from the time they received my cables , I finally get a refund . Never again will I shop with this seller ( MarginMart ) .  
2	  I just bough this unit after using another GPS unit . I enjoy this a lot more . It has great features and is easier to use with the placement of the buttons . I have been planning my thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail and plan on using this to ensure my campsites and shelters to make sure I am on track to finish on time . I find that it easily accepts and sends data to and from my mapping software ..  
1	  My husband bought this bag for me , after I saw a friend of mine carry the black & white version of it . I loved the way both of these bags looked . I was so happy when I recvd it ( after waiting for 6 weeks ) . But , within 1.5 months of use , the straps broke , from both ends . In fact , I was not even carrying thsi bag everyday . Only over the weekends when I would bring my computer home . So , probably carried it around only for 8 weekends .. back & forth from work ! And , in that much use the straps broke . That too , when I have a lighter mac computer . Cant say it was the weight of the stuff that I was putting into it ' cos nothing else fits in this bag . This was fine with me for most part ' cos I dont even carry my charger / mouse etc between home & work . I have a spare set at work . So , overall I am extremely disappointed . Then , I find out that my friend is also not using hers ' cos hers broke in exactly the same place ! So , we both are back on the web looking for another cute looking bag . You would think that since its made only for a laptop ( forget its accessories ) , they woudll have tested it atleast over 10 uses .. SAD !  
1	  I bought these things after reading allot of good reviews . but sadly these didn't meet up to my expectations . The bass is very lacking and the sound is pretty low quality . I am glad I bought them thought to get a personal experience of them , although they are stylish and fold nice that 's pretty much all there is good to say bout these . So i returned them before the return policy ran out , and moved to another Brand . after trying a few models Skull candy makes , I decided they were not for me .  
1	  I live in a rural mountain area approximately 40 miles west of Denver CO and own a fairly nice AM / FM Boston Acoutics tabletop radio with a built in AM antenna . The Terk Advantage antenna impoved the reception only slightly . Maybe it is where I live in the mountains , but I was disappointed , to say the least . The antenna was returned to the seller .  
2	  Overall this is a great cable . The nylon cord makes it a durable and the price is perfect . I paid $ 50 for the same cable at Best Buy and then found this one . I 'm glad I did . It saved me $ 40 and I ended up with a better cable .  
2	  I received my firstHP W2007 20 " Widescreen Flat Panel LCD Monitoras a Christmas gift in 2007 and liked the increase in productivity that I purchased another HP w2007 20 " Flat Panel Monitor to work in a dual screen mode . Both monitors were purchased through the Amazon . com store and the transaction for me was flawless . The monitor arrived in its original manufacturer 's shipping carton with all the required accessories in tact . Setting up the monitor to my Dell PC went without any problems , and the monitor performs much better than I expected . For those people who could benefit from having several applications open at the same time to copy / paste , import / export data between several applications this dual monitor set up fills the bill .  
1	  I wanted to use this card with a digital picture frame . It can not be read in my Belkin card reader . Can not be opened or formatted . It works okay in my Kodak camera but I didn't really want to install the camera software if I didn't have to since I have the card reader .  
2	  I wanted a good pocket size FM radio with presets and a speaker as I don't do earphones very well . This radio fills the bill excellently . It fits in my shirt pocket or on a belt clip ( included ) and has good sound with plenty of volume from the speaker . It does take a little practice to get the preset swiching down as it is a two button process . I also requires a wire antenna ( or the headphones ) plugged into the headphone jack to receive FM which can be a bit anoying but how else would they get an adequate FM antenna into such a small radio ? I receives FM stations as well as the BoomBox and other FM Stereo receiver radions I have . I 'm very pleased !  
2	  I bought this as a scratch and dent . It was fairly inexpensive , but I was worried it wouldn't work with the new digital changes coming up . Some feedback was that the instructions to install were difficult . Mine did not come with instructions , so I downloaded them off the web . I 'm am totally technically challenged , but I CAN READ ! I had it hooked up in about 10 minutes ( back and forth to the computer ) We 've had no problems with it , and if it doesn't work in 2009 , OH , WELL !  
1	  ( 1 ) Poor picture quality . Horizontal lines on vids due to low quality resolution . Blown away by the amazing quality of iPod .. but Zune is truely disappointing . ( 2 ) 50 % thicker the comparable 30GB iPod . In fact , even the 60GB-80GB iPod is slimmer . ( 3 ) Wheel mouse is difficult to use and not cool . ( 4 ) Cheap design . Plastic snap-on to the surface looks like its going to break off . Zune is hand down NOT even nearly comparable to iPod 's superior design , function and quality . Forget Zune for Christmas . Its absolutely horrible . By the way , the brown looks like the color of feces . Overall player just grosses me out .

1	  The outer insulation extremely thin and totally inadequate compared to most of the brands available in the market . I am not happy .

2	  This is not the newest model on the market , however it works and priced right . Now I wait to see how long it lasts .  
1	  This is a total waste of money and engineering . Plenty of free frequencies in my area and it would barely connect to anything . Sound quality horrible even when the device is right next to the antenna on a portable FM player . Wrapping it back up and sending it back .  
2	  Okay , so I know nothing about electronics and hook ups and such . But I did need an HDMI cable for my new Blueray and did not want to pay $ for it ! Well lucky me I found one that works perfectly fine with my Blueray player and what a bargain ! The only reason I did not give this five stars is because I really don't know if a pricier cable would have made a bigger impression ( I kind of doubt it though ) . But don't get me wrong , I would buy this again in a heartbeat and would recommend it to my family and friends as well !  
2	  I purchased this a few months ago specifically for on-hill ski photos . I spend most winter weekends with a bunch of ski racers , and shoot around 3,000 images in a weekend . Swapping lenses on the course is a really bad idea ( lens and camera guts do not mix well with snow , ) so I needed a good way to carry the camera / 200mm lens . This is the best investment I 've made in a camera bag . I 'm not saying that if I take a header down the hill or if I kiss a tree the bag will save the camera - only a hard case would do that . But it does keep the camera safe from minor falls , keeps it warm ( there 's plenty of space to add heat packs ) - and dry . There 's a cover that pulls out of a small pouch that acts as a rain poncho for the bag , making it darn near water proof ! The outside pockets hold extra batteries and CF cards . It also supports the lowepro harness system - I 'm looking into that for this bag and other lowepro bags I own . Update : This winter ( Jan 2010 ) I DID take a header down the hill - 25 foot tumble followed by a 50 foot slide at Marquette Mountain . Camera and lens : undamaged .  
2	  I recently went to Ireland and brought this adapter with me . It fit perfectly . It was small and compact , had a snug fit , and worked as advertised . The price was excellent . I will be using this adapter on future trips to Ireland .  
1	  These combo packs are not for Brother MFC440cn . The end is not compatible when inserted in the machine .  
2	  These speakers were used as my rear surround in my entertainment setup . For 4 years , they served their purpose flawlessly . I 've pushed them to their wattage limit and past it , with no issues whatsoever . I highly recommend these speakers , as they are probably the best bang for your buck you 'll find . And you CANNOT beat the piano finish for that price , just amazing .  
1	  I have had this hub for about a year now , and it progressively gets weaker and weaker . Several of my appliances , like my flash card reader and my digital recorder download receptacle , do not get enough juice to be recognized as even being connected by my computer , when connected to this hub . I have to plug them directly into my computer to be recognized . Now , my HP 4400 printer is no longer being recognized as being connected when on the hub , after months of OK use via the hub . I had to connect it directly to my computer to do some printing . I cannot recommend this hub to anyone . Am now looking for a non-Belkin replacement .  
2	  Just returned from 12 days in Sicily - this fit EVERYTHING I needed ( as well as my purchases ) and allowed me flexibility to carry the day pack as we toured - it fit in overhead bins ( which meant I didn't need to check bags ) and was easy to carry up and down stairs , drag through the cobblestone streets , etc . Well worth buying a new bag when I already had other ones !  
1	  I bought this router based on some excellent reviews that I read online . However , my experience with this router was all bad . It did not play nice with my Mac Book Pro . It was always having a hard time establishing a connection with the router . It worked okay once I turned off Ipv6 on my Mac Book , but I had to do a ton of troubleshooting to find that solution . Even then it still had intermittent connection issues . Then on day 3 , the router died completely . No power , no lights , no data , nothing . I tried a couple of different outlets to make sure it wasn't a bad socket . It wasn't . The router just died . I would not recommend this router to anyone , and I 'll be looking at other options for a replacement .  
1	  I got a multi-pack of these and burned CD 's for stocking stuffers for my family . I think they are thicker than normal CD 's because they got stuck in 2 CD players .. one is in my car and I still can't get it out . DON'T PURCHASE  
2	  My iBook died , and I desperately needed a way to get all of my data off of it since I 'm not very good at backing up my data . This FireWire cable allowed me to transfer the data to one of my other Macs in order to save it . I went to the store and found that many FireWire cables were around $ 30 , but this one was half of that . I , of course would have spent that much in order to save my data , but it was nice not having to . Then I had to use it again when my other Mac died and then I backed up my data TO the iBook . Funny .  
2	  This modem was easy to set up and has been very stable since I installed it . The only issues I had with it was with customer service ( Comcast - their systems were down ) but once they got it working , it 's been great .  
1	  Just recently got a U150 error : " Cartridge not recognized by printer " This follows on the heels of error indicating that I had two of the same print cartridges in the machine several months ago . I have never bought anything but genuine Canon ink . So , maybe there is a defect in the cartridge and the little " keep the user only buying from us " chip . BUT , all I wanted to do was scan an item , NOT PRINT . However the people who designed the software for this thing in their infinite wisdom chose to DISABLE ALL FUNCTIONS if all cartridges are not in the printer , filled with ink and recognizable . So you must at all times keep backups of ALL cartridges in case of the day when your cartridges become unrecognizable to the machine even though the are the correct cartridge in the correct position and filled with ink . You cannot scan or fax without a full complement of cartridges . Maybe the next version will work in a sane logical manner and allow non-printing related functions to work . Until that day I will not be buying another Canon printer . The reason for buying a multifunction printer is so that each function can work independently and not be dependent on the ink supply .  
2	  I originally got this lcd from my dad . He wasn't using it , so I decided to use it . When I had plugged it into power and my computer I tried it . One word describes my thought when it was on : WOW ! This screen had amazing quality , and I have proof . This is true because my computer ( an IBM thinkpad T42 ) had a screen with a resolution of 1400x1050 and even though this lcd had much less pixels , it still had amazing clarity . I personally think this is one of the best screens available .  
1	  This is a link from the Coby website . Mine does not ' spin up ' so can't read disks after 2 months of ownership and maybe 15 hours of use . " To obtain warranty replacement , return the product freight prepaid to the address below within the duration of the warranty . Please enclose the product , copy of receipt , detailed description of the problem and a money order in the monetary amount found on your warranty card . The money order should be made out to COBY ELECTRONICS and covers the cost of return shipping and handling .

1	  Be advised that the item shown on your web-site is not what I received . If you do not have the item you are advertising please correct picture showing what you really have . Waiting to hear from you .  
2	  Great price , works well . I would like to stress the importance of buying a microSD card with a full size SD adapter ( it looks just like a full size SD Card with a little pocket in it for the microSD card ) . Unfortunately , the best way I 've found to reliably transfer files ( cell to / from PC ) is to remove the microSD card from my phone , put it in the adapter , then plug it into an SD card reader on my PC . This has worked every time and I can move all files ( pictures , music , sound , video ) . I do worry a bit about wearing out / breaking the microSD connecter on my phone , but I 'm just going to have to be really careful . My cell phone ( LG Env ) has an awful USB interface for transferring files . Verizon will sell you a kit to transfer music ( ~ $ 30 ) when all you really need is a $ 3 USB data cable . However , the Verizon music software won't allow you to move pictures , video , or sound . They don't make money on the others ( yet ) so they have no incentive to sell or give away software to help you use the other features of your phone - a shame . LG doesn't offer it either ( they can't or Verizon would drop them ) I bought the cable and tried BitPim ( recommended in several web forums ) , but it does not connect reliably - much frustration . Isn't there some 20 something out there that is a software wiz and would like to become famous by writing some software to easily and reliably move files to / from cell phones . And , the way to do it right is to use Bluetooth so nobody needs to buy any strange cables that work just for their phone .  
1	  I figured that for the price , it would be nice to charge my iPod and phone at the same time . But it couldn't charge my iPod Touch , even when there was no second device hooked up . The tolerance on the output is too big so I probably got a bad one , but buyer beware .  
2	  I have only had the case for about a month , but so far it seems fine . It is a little hard to open from time to time ( depending on how coordinated I feel that day ! ) . But I 'd still recommend it .  
2	  I purchased these two " used " SO-DIMM chips in September 2007 and they arrived in about 1 week . The 2 chips were dropped in a styrofoam envelope without any additional wrapping and were loose within the envelope . The chips have worked well and I have not had any issues with them . I would defintely buy these again .  
1	  We purchased one originally on 11/14/05 , it started with the funky , jumbled , letters , numbers , signs , etc within 6-7 months . I took it back to the Discovery Channel store where they gladly replaced it . The new one lasted even less time , and given that they didn't issue me a refund / new receipt from the first return ( my mistake for not insisting ) I could only show the one initial purchase from 11/14/05 . They refused an exchange or refund even though I was within the one year warranty period . However , I did call the 866-537-0384 Wave Customer Service number upon arriving home and they mailed me a new one ! Didn't even ask for proof of purchase ! Even though the product is not well made , they have EXCELLENT customer service !  
2	  It is a bit pricey , however I have found over the years that sometimes paying a few buck more for something is well worth the agrivation . I remember spending hours trying to get a similar low cost unit to fit my Nikon F-2 for the same purpose , and it never did work very well . My use for this little gem is for work with ' astrophotography ' and I have to reley on repeatability and very low light situations to focus . Although I have not tested it against other similar , less expensive units like the Seagull or Photodiox Pro-1 , I can say the Nikon DR-6 seems to give me eactly what I wanted . It fits very well on my D300 and the 2x feature is a very big plus .  
2	  Timely delivery . Breifcase is well constructed , has lots of useful compartments . Superior in comparison to other similar breifcases . Decent price .  
2	  The Sony RDR-GXD455 is just what I needed . It sets up easily and is intuitive in its use . Thanks for a great product .  
2	  Excellent sound quality . First when i brought it , i did not think it will be so good in performance . Only thing is you may have to buy a battery recharger and rechargable AA batteries to save on buying AA batteries all the time . The Player is just doing great for me .  
2	  I got this for my new sony blu-ray portable player it is the best I have looked it so buy it you will not be sorry .. +  
1	  Canon deliberately designed this thing to force you to buy their expensive ink cartridges whether you need them or not ( the tech person at Canon told me that all their multifunction printer / scanner / etc . stop functioning completely when there 's an ink problem ) . You can't send a fax or scan a document unless everything is ok with the ink - nevermind that you don't actually use ink to scan or send faxes . I 'm giving it one star only because Amazon won't let me give zero . Also , the ink cartridges go bad just sitting there in the machine , whether you actually print with it or not . I 've had this thing for , I don't know , maybe a year and a half , during which I 've printed maybe a couple dozen pages . Now it tells me I 'm out of ink . It keeps giving me error messages for different cartridges , sometimes cyan , sometimes magenta , sometimes black . I take them in and out , and sometimes the thing calms down long enough to let me print a couple of pages . The cartridges cost maybe $ 60 or $ 70 for a full set ( I haven't bothered to sort out the various offers from Amazon , since I 'm not going to buy them anyway ) . It works ok when it works , and maybe it would be fine for someone who is going to use it mostly to print , so that you 're using up cartridges as fast as Canon thinks you should ( there 's an electronic chip in each cartridge to force you to buy only Canon ) . But I 'm so annoyed at them for deliberately engineering it to force you to buy more ink , that I 'm not going to buy another Canon product of any kind , ever . I 'll go with companies that aren't trying to milk me for every dime they can get . By the way , it 's large , heavy , slow , and noisy .  
1	  I bought the card and when I moved my laptop to another room 50 feets away it stopped connecting . Even 900 MHz phone works there .  
2	  Great cable especially for the price . Upgraded from analog D-sub cable to this DVI cable , immediately noticed a difference in quality on my LCD .  
1	  My usb port was about 1.5 feet from the mouse and the mouse still did not pick up the signal . Tried it out with 2 sets of mice and the same results . Went back to Best Buy and got a logitech ( V200 ) that worked right out of the box  
1	  If you can keep from getting irritated at the failure rate and keep a backup elsewhere . Boy do I wish I had known about that BEFORE I had bought one . I have had my segate drive for a little over a year now with minimal problems . Since I use many different computers it has held all my stuff . About 8 months ago it began to malfunction . It began to get abnormally hot , the computer would complain about memory loss ( and worse , that it didn't recognise the drive ) , and it wouldn't shut off when the computer did . In fact , it wouldn't shut off at all . I could pull the usb cord out of the computer or out of the drive and it would still run . That should have turned it off . Nope . I had to pull the power cord out of it to get it to shut down . So that became the routine , shut down the computer , pull the power cord out of my seagate . Knowing what was coming I tried to back up the information to other sources , a very difficult task since as I said , I use many different computers and none have very much space , and I can't afford a second h / d . When it didn't come after two months and stopped acting up , I sort of forgot about the problem . Another two months go by , problem free and then one day I start it up only to have the computer tell me that the information on it is corrupt and it has to be formatted . I am soo not happy . Long story short , pretty good drive .. I was happy anyway . Up until the crapping out . Now , I am never getting another seagate . Ever . But hey , thanks to Seagate , I 've become a Western Digital convert .  
2	  Coming from a Casio EX-Z40 , I can definatley say I prefer the sd300 . This camera is actually smaller than the Z40 which is hard to believe . The picture quality is ASTONASHING ! The battery life , although , is subpar compared to the Z40 . This is one of the only cameras to support high spead SD cards for lightning fast recording and playback . For those who are claiming the screen " just cracked " , my response to that is take care of the damn thing . If you are going to spend hundreds of dollars on it you treat it like gold . Whenever it is in my pocket , it is alone , no keys , no cell phone .. nothing ! If anyone has any questions about this camera feel free to e-mail me at hhersch9000 @ gmail . com .  
2	  Why would you pay $ 60 + for HDMI cables when these work just as well ? If you go to a store the sales clerk will tell you that the expensive cable is better . If you don't know better , it 's easy to believe that . Don't be fooled ! These cables work just as well at a fraction of the cost .  
2	  I needed something to share the DSL connection between two computers in separate rooms . I already had holes in the walls for a network connection with a crossover cable and had network cards installed , so I didn't need a wireless router and receivers . I decided on getting this one due to being familiar with the company 's cable modem . Setting up the computers with the router was simple with the help of the CD installation program . The router automatically treated the crossover cable as a regular ethernet cable which saved me another trip to the store . Updating the firmware was also easy to do and no problems came out of that . A few weeks later , the Linksys router kept resetting itself every 15 minutes every time I had torrent connections going . Through some online searching , I found out that my DSL modem had a built-in router as well and there was some conflict with the Linksys router . After switching off most of the auto-detect options and manually entering in most of the connection settings on both the DSL modem and Linksys router , the router was rock-solid again . As long as the firmware is up to date and there are no conflicts between the modem and router , it should work without problems .  
2	  I have had this for about a month . In the time I have used it it has performed well . If you miss a turn it recalculates your directions . Don't expect it to be perfect . There have been a couple times it has told me I was turning on a road that was a different named road than was actually there , but it was the correct way to get to where I was going . Example ( it will say " turn right in a 1/4 mile on Smith St . , and when you get to where Smith St . is , it is actually Johnson St . ) . When it does this , I just go ahead and turn on the street and usually it turns out to be the right way . Also , the speaker is not loud enough for me . I was planning on hooking up and external speaker but the head phone connection , where I was going to connect the speaker to , is smaller than the mini plug that is on head phones or speakers . I think mini phones or speakers are 3.5 mm and I think the one on the Mio is 2.5 . I will have to find an adapter . Bummer ! I did get my money 's worth for this product . It seems to have the features of the more expensive units at a least expensive price .  
2	  This fixed the problem and was delivered in a most timely manner , I always buy new and never buy those refilled cartridges . Stick with the HP manufacturers new cartridge , it will save much grief down the road .  
1	  The 6-in-1 Reader did not work . The video program kept crashing . But the worst part is the essentially non-existent support from Pinnacle Systems . Couldn't find an answer on their troubleshooting website ; after 2 weeks of sending e-mails in a futile effort to get some help , I bundled it up and sent it back !  
2	  After using telephoto lenses it was hard for me to go back to standard photos . Friends and family photograph better when the camera isn't " in their face . " Still , manual telephotos are cumbersome . Too many right moments lost . This camera solved my problems . I 'm online here because I 'm having to shop for a new Olympus iS-20 . The one I had is missing !  
1	  This work well , however they are still too big for my ears . One inevitably keeps popping out , which makes it difficult to keep it on my head . The sound quality and everything else is great , I just wish the ear buds were smaller .  
2	  This is my second time using this keyboard for over five years now and beats the heck of the regular standard keyboard .  
2	  Sounds great . It will reveal sounds in your music you would not hear with cheap ones . Blocks all outside noise so it 's great for long flights . I have to take ' em off intermittenly when using them for extend amount of time . If you wear it with the wire hanging behind it will catch and fall off easily if your head don't stay still . That aside , I 'm quite happy with it .  
2	  This power supply is exactly what was described , works well , and hasn't given me any problems . Nothing notable , but fast shipping and a good product . Strongly recommend .  
2	  When I bought this camera , was a little skeptical about Kodak but to my surprise the camera has performed above expectations . The easyshare software is pretty helpful too . I also have a compact Canon SD 1100IS but got to say I find Kodak 712 results far better . The results in low light were a little .. " low " but using this camera with a tripod during night gave better performance .  
1	  I bought this camera and had to return it , because it was not worth a flip . I used it to record my daughter 's Christmas program a few weeks ago , and I was just lucky that I brought another camera . The image was so blurry , you cannot even see anything but fuzz . If I would not have brought our digital camera , I would not have any memories taken from this event . This camera is so unreliable . I would not recommend this to anybody but maybe a child who wants to use it as a play video camera .  
2	  I really enjoy my Zune . Be careful that you don't leave it on while you are not using it or your battery dies and you don't know it .  
2	  It brings things up so close and clear . You can count the leaves on the tree .  
1	  Have been using this device for a few months and this morning the whole device became corrupt . My history of use with the device : 1 ) I always keep the cap on when not in use , 2 ) have never exposed it to adverse temperatures , 3 ) only use it on computers I know / trust , 4 ) NEVER remove it until all files been fully written [ typical error with most flash drive users ] , 5 ) perform antivirus scans and data corruption scans on a regular basis . I include all of that history to show that I try to take care of tech purchases such as this - no point in wasting money . During the file transfer this morning of a powerpoint that I made for our church 's worship service I got a read / write error and the file transfer stopped . I attempted to perform typical scans , but got an error message that the drive is " inaccessible " . I ejected the drive , checked the USB port and drivers ( both fine ) , tested another USB flash Drive on the same port ( it tested fine ) and transferred my file to that drive ( no problem ) . I rebooted my machine and reinserted the DataStick Sport and received a message that asked me to scan / fix the drive [ OK ] and got the same message that it is " inaccessable " . After going through numerous troubleshooting / tech sites regarding this issue ( including Centon 's ) I am now conviced that I wasted my money on this . I am just glad that I have backup USB flash drives ( NEVER trust your fate to only one ! ) Primary flaw : Total corruption during writeSecondary flaw : unusually long read / write speed ( the manufacturer 's speed claims have never proven to be true in MY experience ) .  
2	  worked as expectedeasy to set up and get workingworking great as main router into housewith wireless and wired connections networked from it  
1	  Wanna know why this product is so cheap ? Because it won't work in a couple of months . I just went to watch a movie , and the picture is in black and white ONLY . NO COLOR . I called Apex , and they agreed that it was defective , and now want ME to pay the shipping + handling , in order to send it to them . Apex is going in the trash can , and now I 'm off to buy a REAL player .  
2	  this mic is great . It has a long wire / jack and you don't have to be too close for it to pick up your voice . its a great buy .  
1	  I have been using this CardScan for a while now with Windows XP and it has proved to do an adequate job . However I recently changed to the Vista operating system and the scanner stopped working so I went looking for an downloadable update on the company website but was unable find any . I contacted CardScan by email and they replied that they indeed had an upgrade available but that I would have to pay $ 80 ( plus S & H ) for it . All of the other hardware vendors for other products I use with my computer ( Dymo LabelWriter , Neat Receipts , etc ) either offered a free downloadable Vista update or an update for a reasonable charge . Because of this I did not purchase the way overpriced CardScan upgrade and can now only give this otherwise good product two stars . I will not be purchasing another CardScan product in the future .  
1	  I purchased the Black & Decker 100 watt laptop Power To Go cordless AC / USB power supply to use to exclusivelypower my ipod . I recently went to California on vacation and I wanted to extra run-time power for viewing video 's on my iTouch . I paid fifty dollars for the power supply and discovered that the unit would not run my iTouch for very long . I attempted to recharge the unit several times but each time I got the same results . the power supply will not hold a charge and immediately drops down to zero . i am lucky to get one recharge andperhaps two hours of run time on my iTouch . this unit supposedly designed to run a laptop computer ! I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED with the performance of the product and can not recommend this device . I also notice that the manufacturing date stamped on the device was early 2007 which leads to wonder if the batteries have developed a short chemical memory due to the extended shelve time . I hope this review helps . Save your money and find something that actually works .  
1	  I returned this " Hi-Fi System " because the CD player didn't work . That may have been bad luck , but it is still pretty junky . It doesn't even have a bass or tremble dial .. not even a tone dial !  
2	  Got This Is A Gift For Christmas I Reccomend It To Anybody Great Photo Quality And Easy To Use Touch Screen . This Is A Good Camera For Everyday Use .  
1	  I bought this , at a very reasonable price . It worked for a week and then , when the first set of batteries died off , it never worked again . It won't even power on . But , for the one week it DID work , it was decent enough for the price I paid for it . Not sure if I 'd recommend it , mainly due to the fact that it no longer works .  
2	  Although I have the original iPad cover that can be use as a stand , this one also supports portrait orientation and is somewhat more stable . I use it in combination with the iPad cover . It 's a good product and fairly cheap . You can't go wrong with it !  
2	  Prompt order fulfillment , and great price for this OEM product which I ordered as a replacement for use with my Dell Axim X51v PDA .  
2	  Does what it says . Provides a nice case to carry around my buds . No complaints .  
2	  Took a whole 60 seconds to hook up , it works just great and the price is right . I did read reviews here , so didn't bother with the manual . But yeah .. connect the cables , insert drive into casing , insert screws , righty tighty , power cable , USB cable , POOF ! Drive detected .  
2	  We purchased this printer right after Christmas and couldn't be happier . It copies great , scans perfectly and prints out beautiful pictures . We bought the Canon PIXMA to replace a standard HP printer and now we don't know what we did without it ! It is much more economical with ink that our old HP and doesn't take up much more desk space that the HP did either . The Canon is a HUGE step up , if you get this printer , you won't be disappointed !  
1	  I bought this amp on eBay for around $ 60 . I had it bridged to a single 12 " in a sealed box 4Ohm . It 150w bridged @ 4 Ohms . I am upgrading already . That being said . It is a cheap 1st amp for a audio n00b . I bought it knowing it wasnt that great . I just had no idea why . After a year I fully understand why . I have pounded the hell out of it and it has not died . If you are thinking of this amp , email me , Ill sell you mine for 20 ! lol . no , seriously .. I will .  
2	  First of all , let me say that the CASIO 125 can do amazing things . It is all it 's made out to be and more . The screen is the best I have seen on a pocket PC , the audio is good , not great , the handwriting recognition is incredible , and the software is getting better . Let me also say that even if you are pretty adept at tech toys , this one will take some time to figure out . Which is not to say that what you read about this is misleading , it just means that the operating system and the Unit itself is a bit different and more complicated than my desktop windows and previous Palm . First of all , the modem that Amazon was offering for free with this did not work , and between calls to Casio , the modem manufacturer , and my ISP , I finally figured out that I had to donwload a new driver from the web , which was not mentioned anywhere in any documentation . Since there is no diagnostic tool included on Windows CE 3.1 , I couldn't even tell what was wrong . Very frustrating for a week or so . Also , the files can be tough to delete .. how do you delete a recording ? .. and the inability to close running programs is a BIG change to get used to . Loading programs from the web , through active sync and onto a compact flash card that is attached to the unit is also a challenge as I try to figure that one out as well . There are also a few other things that I won't bore you with , but my point is that if you are expecting anything close to the familiarity of windows 98 on your Pocket PC , you have some learning to do . However , once you get used to this , the CASIO will be one of the best investments you will make , just be prepared to invest some time in trying to figure out how everything works , especially since documentation overall is very weak . All in all , I 'm very pleased with my purchase !  
2	  I needed a short CAT5 cable to connect my router to my cable modem . This one foot cable worked perfectly , as the router is right next to the modem . I did not want to bundle up a longer cable for this very short run . I have all the tools , testers , connectors and wire to make up my own patch cables , but for $ 2 a piece , it was easier to just order a few of these cables . They worked just fine when I received them and plugged them in .

1	  I purchased this cable to hook my Dell XPS m1710 to my Mitsubishi 720p projector . The first cable i got was showing a red distorted picture on my projector and no picture at all on my samsung lcd panel . I went to exange the cable and got one wich was working but there were no blue color on the screen . So i went to get my money back but they insist on trying a third cable , testing it on their own laptop and screen in the store . I was working goog this time . I may have bough 2 cable that had problem in the manufacturing process , maybe the only 2 bad cable in the line but it was very frustrating . I agreed with the reviewer complaining about the package . There is an easy pull tab on the rear of the package , but it only give you acces to the middle of the cable , the connector are stuck in the front of the packaging , so you have to use a combination of knife , scissor and patience to pull it out , very frustrating after the 3rd time . No more belkin cables for me , never again .  
1	  THe little wireless thing that you plug into the computer stopped finding the mouse within 2 weeks of buying the mouse . It also had some odd little quirks working with a Mac . You have to sync it twice if you want it to work properly . I haven't called tec support yet , but at least it has a warranty for five years ..  
2	  Product arrived on time and intact . I was very surprised at the diameter of the hood but it makes sense since the Canon 10-22mm EF-S has a 77mm outer lens rim . Although the hood appears quite large , it makes a snug and perfect fit on the lense itself . I tested it out on the mountain range viewable outside my home as well as a shot of the length of my street on a relatively sunny afternoon in SoCal . The hood controls flaring quite nicely especially with high light conditions and appropriate ISO settings that I was experimenting with . I highly recommend 77mm filters . Currently , I am using UV or Polarized filters depending on the shots / conditions . Hood does not interfere with either fitting on or around filters . Canon quality is very apparent . Hood even looks great on the lens as well . Highly recommended accessory especially for outdoor photography .  
2	  Good cord . Solid construction . It does what it says and I really can't say more than that . I wanted a 10 foot cord so I could reach my laptop anywhere in my room .  
2	  I have an APC Smart 1500 UPS which uses a RBC7 battery . As an APC partner , I wanted to get an APC replacement but did not want to pay almost double . The American Battery Co . RBC7 replacement battery has a two year warrantee . It was received ( double boxed ) via Fed Ex in one day . Except for the label , the battery was exactly the same as the original . APC is not a battery manufacturer ( I suspect the American Battery Co . may be the OEM for APC ) . Recycling the old battery was easy and free at Auto Zone ( dozens of other site were also listed on the internet ) .  
1	  This is the second CANON digital camera that has failed , one after 2-years of use , the other after only 10mo use . The first camera was out-of-warranty so no repair was attempted . The second camera , an SD800 , failed while still under " warranty " . CANON refused warranty service due to moisture damage found in the camera . The camera had seen significant use but was never exposed to significant moisture , e.g. , it was never dropped in or splashed with liquid . In the real world it could easily have experienced a few drops of moisture . As a retired engineer it is my opinion that these CANON cameras are not designed to stand-up to the rigors of the real world . They work well out of the box but are not robust enough to provide service for anywhere near as long as numerous film cameras I have used for decades with no significant problems . I will move on to another brand in hopes of finding a more real world ready digital camera , one that is designed to resist damage from a few drops of moisture .  
2	  This is an exceptionally nice case and is well sized for a single DSLR , lenses , and all the small accessories one needs to carry . I use a Tamrac Expedition 6X Backpack when I need to carry 4 or 5 lenses and a couple of flash heads , but for less demanding use the ApeCase is great . I can fit a Canon 40D w / 17-85EF-S IS , a 430EX flash , a 10-22 EF-S , a 70-300 EF IS , a half dozen filters , lens shades for all three lenses , 3 camera batteries w / charger , ( 2 ) sets of flash batteries , ( 8) CF cards in cases , camera and flash manuals , and the case is only about 75 % full . Before buying the ApeCase , I used ( 2 ) smaller , expensive Samsonite cases to carry the same gear and this is a much better solution . The ApeCase seems well made and its padding is thicker than most other cases of its size . Although it 's called a " large " size , I find it 's really not too big and is ideal for my use . Fully loaded with all of the above the case weighs a total of 10 - 1/2 lbs and is not a problem to carry . I have other " name-brand " camera cases that cost 3X the price of this one and which are no better built and certainly no more functional that this unit . I 'll probably buy a couple more soon before Norazza realizes that it is worth much more than the asking price . This case is easily equal or better than many " name-brand " cases that sell for 3 to 4 times its price and none of those have the slick yellow interior .  
1	  Bought this in November of 2009 and it died in March of 2010 . Didn't actually quit , it just started giving the infamous " service required " message . From what I can find on the ' net , this usually means that the antenna has failed it 's self calibration test and must be returned to Beltronics for adjustment ; makes sense because the unit suddenly started running a " Self Cal " test every couple of days about two weeks prior to it failing , something it had never done before . It probably could be returned under warranty given it failed within four months except for the fact that Amazon is not an authorized seller and purchasing for a non-authorized seller voids it 's 1 year warranty . I suspect the cost of returning the unit for repair is going to be prohibitively high ; I have found postings on the net where the cost of this type repair was a flat rate $ 80.00 , which is over 50 % of what I paid for it . However when it was working , it really was very good at alerting in plenty of time to keep you out of trouble . My work commute is 47 miles one way and it saved me from a sure ticket at least twice in the four months it worked . I am now using a Whistler Pro 78 SE . I have found that it has almost exactly the same range on K band as the V955 . I 've tested this using one of those " Your Speed Is " signs that is permanently installed on the interstate I drive to work . The Whistler alerts at the same distance the V955 did as gauged by a nearby streetlight . I suspect it will do as well or better on Ka band . The Whistler also has a better warranty ( 3 year vs . 1 year ) and as far as I know , buying from Amazon does not void it .  
1	  I bought a pair of these radios six months ago and I had trouble with them right away . The " on " button on one of the units only worked some of the time . Then last week both units stopped working . I replaced the batteries with new ones and they still don't work . I bought these because I thought they were a good deal but I guess it 's true that you get what you pay for .  
2	  I really love this bag . I 've taken great care of it but for some reason the sewing near the zipper is coming undone and now I can see inside my bag .. I 'm no expert at sewing , but I 'm going to attempt to fix it . The reason I love this bag is the fact that it feels so light even with my 15 " macbook inside and other items . You can easily fit a notebook in it along with pencils , your laptop charger , and mouse . It has a little hole to slip your headphones from in case you want to listen to music on the go . Very nice design :) I 'm just a bit depressed mine is breaking :( I still use it though , lol .  
2	  If you hate tangles of cords this is for you . The product is kinda flat and not round as I thought so takes a few more wraps to get the cord around . Overall would buy again .  
1	  There 's absolutely no reason to pay $ 27 for 100 bags , when you can just use the cheap clear plastic office wastebasket liners ( 7 to 10 gallon ) that sell for $ 18 for * 500 * at Costco , Sam 's Club , etc . I just finished a major shredding job with my Fellowes DMC12 , and used many of those .  
1	  I upgraded to N1 for our house because it is adobe ( earth brick ) and have had trouble with attenuation on my previous router . N1 works no better - about 20 feet thru 2 walls knocks it out . I bought a Buffalo AirStation ( WLI-TX4-G54HP ) and it works much better - even though it 's not N1 !  
2	  Polk Audio RTi4 High Performance Bookshelf / On-Wall Speakers , Pair ( Black Oak ) ( Purchased on 11/18/2007 ) Great speakers , don't need a woofer . Sounds good just as they come . Just the right size and performs like the big ones .  
2	  Two years ago , I bought one of these Delkin Pop-up shades for my digital camera and loved it . When my DH complained that he couldn't see the screen on hisKodak Mini Video Camera with SD Card ( Grey ) in the bright daylight ( usually when it 's used ) I naturally thought of this wonderful product . It was easy to find out what size and installation was a breeze ( I first put it on a little wonky , but I was able to re-position it ) . I did put some heavy tomes on top if it for a day to make sure it stuck and it is now solidly attached . My DH is no longer unsure of whether the camera is on or not and I am not editing out as many of those funky times when the camera is thought to be off ..  
2	  it 's a little slow in focusing , but it 's lightest and most compact lens you can carry for the lens that reach this far . Near macro works good too . this lens and NikonD700 has good harmony i think .  
2	  The Linksys router was easy to setup as the entire management software is web-based . ( including the advanced features , so you do not have to telnet into the box ) . I have few machines behind the firewall some with dynamic addressing , other with static configuration . VPN once setup properly ( no enabled by default on the router ) , works great , but I read you can only have one VPN connection at a time which can be a limitation . VPN is mostly used nowadays to access corporate servers using your Internet connection . So if you have two machines that need to access your Corporate at the same time on two different companies ( yours and your spouse if you work from home ) , you won't be able to do so . If you need some technical support on advanced features , be careful , linksys web site saysLinksys provides no phone or e-mail support for the advanced features of the router .  
1	  I bought this as a gift for my grandson , and it failed on the first attmpt to use it - swallowed a VHS tape and would neither play nor eject it . The design concept is good , but quality control seems to be non-existent . Back to Sears it goes , and shame on them for carrying the line .  
1	  The previous version Trendnet TEW card for wireless G worked really well for me . So I was hoping for same experience in upgrading to Trendnet wireless N. But unfortunately this card have stability problem and would often disconnect . Now I 've to constantly do a manual disconnect and reconnect to establish network connection . I think it 's better that I revert back to the previous Trendnet wireless G.  
1	  I cannot rate the item as it never worked and I had to return it . I am hoping the new one will be in working order .. it just arrived so I cannot say more . I was not overly pleased at the length of time it took to send me a new one .. I sent it UPS on Mar 6th and received the new on Mar 21 but only after I sent an email asking where it was . I was promised a $ 7.50 credit on the postage that I paid .. Have not seen that as yet but I am hopeful .  
2	  Noteworthy for their eye-blinking impact and up-front presentation . If Sennheiser ' phones sound like the Amsterdam Concertgebouw , these sound like CBGB 's . Considered by many to be the best rock headphones in the world . I like them quite well for jazz and classical ( especially solo performances ) , but for rock they really do get your head banging ! Weakness include a narrow " in your head " soundstage , not the best build quality ( plastic ) , some people find them uncomfortable ( I don't . They 're quite lightweight , but they touch your ears when you wear them , and some people just don't like that I guess ) , but the kicker is for them to sound their best you really have to change the pads . " Change the pads .. " you ask ? For the most bass , do a Google for ' Todd the Vinyl Junkie ' and pick up a pair of Grado flat pads . For the best balance ( and to save a little money ) go to Sennheiser 's site and grab a pair of replacement pads for the HD-414s . They 're yellow , and you have to cut a hole in them ( about an inch and a quarter ) but it 's well worth it . Probably not truly a 5-star ' phone in the grand scheme of things ( like the Sennheiser Orpheus or Stax Omega II ) , but their strong suits are unmatched by any other manufacturer 's headphones at any price .  
1	  Our Philips DVD Home Theatre System HTS3450 just lost all its sound . It is really too bad as the DVD player still works , just no sound . We had it for about 2 years . I hate the thought of having to fill a landfill with all this plastic just because a company can't make a lasting product . I will be looking for a better made system to replace this one . Save your money and the environment and find a better made product .  
2	  I 've had mine for two years now and it is an outstanding case . The humidification sponge in the case leaves a lot to be desired . I have sacrificed one of the cigar slots and put aDrymistat Humidifier Tubein its place and it keeps my cigars perfectly for months between refills . I carry my with me everywhere .  
1	  I cannot believe all the good reviews on this lamp . I had mine all of 3 weeks when it died . It was not from the bulb burning out ( I replaced the bulb because I thought that was what was wrong ) . It just died . My nephew ( a stage lighting tech ) finally took it apart for me to check the wiring and connections and the thing looked intact : it just didn't work . I cannot recommend this product at all . Maybe I got the only lemon in the pack but that 's enough to keep me away from investing in another one . I 'm giving it one star just for the idea . It is a good idea yielding poor results in my reality .  
1	  My FM Transmitter stopped working about a week after I bought my Belkin Tunebase FM for Zune . Not a great loss though since the sound was terrible to say the least . At least it charges my zune and functions decently as a place to mount my zune . Still , I am very disappointed this product broke after just one week .  
2	  I 've had this player for about two months now . Its a great little with some aggravating elements to it that might be too much for some people . Pros : sounds great to me ( I replaced the ear buds with a better pair ) , easy to transport songs into it , decent equalizer , plays WMA files , pretty small and compact but feels like a decent quality , screen is clear and bright . Cons : the " shuffle " mode does not randomize every single time and there is no " resume " mode . This means that when you 're in shuffle mode and you choose the same song to start with as you chose last time ( since its just easiest that way ) , it will play a similar ( if not exactly the same ) group of songs . To get a totally random song order , you need to start with a new song , which is a bit of a hassle . Mine has skipped some if I had it in my pocket while running , but in my hand it has worked fine . Mine has pretty much worked as advertised and I am satisfied with it . That said , I 'm pretty sure flash player prices will be plummeting so its not a bad idea to wait either .  
2	  The Nextar C3 works as good as I expected for the price I paid ( $ 149 ) . I will recommend it . I had it for 3 months got to move from Tennessee to upstate New York . The directions were right all the way up and I been using it to get around in my new state and no problems so far . PROS : - Price-Size-It acquires satellites faster than my Garmin . - Usually gets me within 10-20 feet of my destination , if the destination is in the map . - More stuff than you need like a remote control and mp3 player . CONS : - * The maps seem to be about 2 years old . I was living in a 2 year old development and the Nextar C3 kept telling me I was off road . - The lighter power cable is to stiff ; I wish it had a straight cable instead of a phone cord looking one . It pulls on the device and I 'm afraid it might break the plug in . So I only use it to recharge The charge lasts for about 6 hours of continuous use .  
2	  very nice sound and great isolation . when the music 's going , can't hear any outside noise . i 'm still prefer analog , over digital , because of the greater response and sound quality , but these sound great for either use .  
2	  I 've been after one of these for months as you all know in todays world we have so many usernames and passwords to remember . Most people have system or use the same passwords but then you get to a site that wont except you normal combination ! Well this little device has worked every time for me . Easy installation , one reboot and you are ready to go . Use it to logon to windows ( not domain though ) and then open up internet explorer and start registering sites . The other major disappointment with this reader is that it doesnt work out of the box with firefox , which is bad as this is what I use most of the time but .. the good news is that there is an extension ( plugin ) for firefox that lets you use it , its by no means full proof but its a step in the right direction . $U$  
1	  I 've been using the Polycom Communicator for about 10 months now . It is an excellent device , the only problem is that once you unwind the USB cable from the back you cannot wind it back and get it to fit as snug as before . This was not much of a problem until after sometime the device started producing some static ( which I could barely hear but it was producing a loud hum via the mike so I could not be heard ) . Time to put the Polycom support to test , I searched on their website and called the support number , the support number directed me back to the support section of the site and mentioned that there was a link where I could get online support ( I assume over email ) but when I click the link it give me a list of numbers to call and when you call the number ( you guessed right ) it directs you right back to the site . So basically no support . This is a really nice product but has no support it worked fantastic but now its can just be used as a interesting looking paper weight . I expected more from Polycom support  
2	  The different between having a GPS that that works and one that doesn't . I live in Sao Paulo , Brasil , and the reception without the Gilsson Antenna , was very poor . Sometimes I arrived to my destination and the GPS still didn't catch any satellites . With the Gilsson antenna it catches almost every satellite and the precision is of about 3 metres ( 9 feet ) . I would definitely recomend it .  
2	  Good product .. no problems yet thus far ( had it for around 6 months ) . Only issue would be it slides off my HP screen because my laptop screen is too thick and not flat . Other than that , it 's great .  
1	  This antenna doesn't provide an adequate signal ; it is less than half as effective compared to the pair of rabbit ears that I had lying around the house .  
2	  It lasts many times longer than the battery that came with my camcorder , but dang , the thing is huge . With it on , my camcorder doesn't fit in my standard case anymore . So I still use the original battery and decided to have this one as the " out all day shooting video " battery . Plus , when you finally do run out of juice , you better plan on charging that thing overnight . It last tons longer than the standard battery , but also takes tons more time to charge . Either way , you should get one . Pretty cheap for an authentic JVC battery too .  
1	  This case is a complete dirt and lint magnet . It is not ideal for a woman who would keep it in her purse .  
2	  This product was used on a Flip Ultra non-HD camera . Obviously the allure for this product was the price . This tripod works fairly well for the standard shot but doesn't allow for much creativity with the camera . After reading numerous glowing reviews I thought this product would be more than it actually is ; but I must remember the price . For what I payed , the build quality is excellent , the compact size is extremely useful and I have had no problems with stability . My one complaint is that the tripod is very inelastic and makes bending the tripod for interesting shots difficult . My next aim will be theJoby GP3 Gorillapodwhich appears to offer more flexibility . 4 stars , and for the price I would recommend it to anyone just wanting to make their simple camera stand up straight for clear , still video .  
2	  After reading numerous reviews about universal remotes , I decided on the Sony RM-VL900 and couldn't be happier . Even though I do not own all Sony components , the remote controls all the functions of my TV ( Mitsubishi ) , DVD ( Sony ) , Cable Box ( GI ) and Receiver ( Yamaha ) . If there was a function I wanted transferred , the remote " learned " it easilly . The macro function is really great and the main reason I bought this remote . With the touch of 1 button I can turn everything on and start watching instead of fumbling with remotes . When I had trouble programming my cable box , a call to the Sony 800 number solved the problem in a few minutes . ( By the way , it was user error on my part ) . For the price , this remote is a bargain .  
1	  I had the EXACT same experience as the Feb . 16 2004 reviewer ! The only difference is that my Dimage had to be sent back to the factory straight from the box because it was filled with fine lint like particles . It NEVER has worked properly .. I will never purchase a Minolta anything ! ever ! and I 'll tell all my friends ..  
1	  I gave it a rating of 1 because that was the lowest choice available . Amazon didn't give me the option of a negative number . I received my first ( of 3 ) as a gift & it lasted about 1 month before it completely froze up & stopped working . Because one corner of the cover refused to stay down , I optimistically hoped that it had been dropped and damaged in the store or in shipment , so I replaced it with an identical model . 2nd one worked for 11 months before it stopped working . Since it was under warranty for 1 more month , I sent it back . Whether iRiver replaced it with a new one or repaired the old one , I don't have a clue . I just received a player back from them without any explaination about what was done . It worked for about 2 months , before it stopped working . No attempts at resetting or reformatting have worked . So now all I have basically is a $ 300 paperweight . I will never buy from iRiver again .  
2	  First of all , thanks to the many people here who offered such extensive reviews of this unit . It certainly helped me decide to give the Athena a try . I 'm glad I did ! As others have noted , the sound is clear and crisp . Bass is adequate without being overwhelming . It looks more stylish than the photos indicate and works fine with my iPod Touch . A hint : while it did fine with most music genres , I wasn't thrilled with how it handled classical music - it sounded a little muddy . Leafing through the instruction manual ( which I always do last - must make a note to stop doing that ) I read that it recommends that you turn the EQ setting on your iPod to Off . I did this and it does make a difference , not only for classical music but it made everything sound better . This is a tremendous bargain for the price and Vann 's service was impressive .  
2	  Don't waste money on $ 50 cables elsewhere-this one does the job for a fraction of the cost !  
2	  I wanted a non expensive cable to hook up my Hp laptop and HDTV , so i took a chance and bought this chap cable . I can tell you that i made a great decision . Once it connected the screen on the television displayed my laptop screen . It was Crystal clear ! I would recommend this product to anyone . Don't go to best buy and buy the 40 dollar cable , its the same thing .  
2	  Despite its cumbersome appearance , this converter works very well and is a great deal in comparison to other options on the market !  
1	  This is my third sirius radio . Unfortunately this is my second xact , and my last . I have emailed xact ( the only way to contact xact ) three times . I have gotten no response from anyone there . Sirius is no help either . In fact I am considering canceling my sirius account and going back to commercial radio . It is easier listening to commercials then it is to deal with all of the trouble I have had with the radios over the last two months . I caution everyone that xact is JUNK . Run away from xact as fast as you can . This product is a waste of time and money . I am sure there are radios out there that work better . I just have not found one yet .  
1	  After using for over a month the priter , - for reasons unknown - fails to print - advances 1 label & shows printer errors thereafter  
2	  I bought this cd player for my grandson and one for myself . It 's got a nice sound to it , reasonably price , has a remote and is very portable . Nice looking little player .  
2	  Quote .. " As far as all HDTV lies : THIS SET IS NOT HDTV ! Don't get all upset , now . The only HDTV set capable of producing 720p signal is 50 " plasma . This 42 " plasma has only 1024 vertical lines and for so called HDTV ( 720P ) you need 1280 . So this set will never show 720 progressively scanned HD picture . This is not being a nock against Panasonic , every manufacturer unapologetically lies to consumers right now due to lack of FCC regulations . If you want to get 42 " set look into cheaper EDTV . They have better black level performance and also work better with analog cables . If you must have so called HDTV save money for 50 " set . Currently only 50 " Panasonic plasma TV is capable of producing 720P resolution . " The problem with the internet is that misinformed people have equal access to posting reviews . This set IS HD , and the set DOES display 720p . The resolution is 1024x768 . The horizontal lines are 768 , and therefore IS capable of displaying 720p . The 50 " has the same number of horizontal lines , but 1366 vertical lines . ( 1366x768 ) Quote .. " As far as up converting DVDs . , don't waist your money if you already have progressive scan DVD player . You will not notice any picture improvement . Despite what the mass consumer believes . , those up-converting DVDs do not convert DVD signal into 720P or 1080i resolutions those numbers just used by industry ( frivolously ) to indicate some process that produces " better " picture by way of line-doubling . There is no DVD on earth that can take 680x480 signal and make it 1280x720 . " Again it 's probably better to do some research before taking D.Karzoff ' free ' advice . Up-converting or up-scaling DVD players DO output 720p or 1080i . The benefit of these players varies between tvs . The reason they give better picture is because the good ones have better chipsets for up-scalling than what cheap televisions do . If buying , the HDMI players give much better colours / contrast on the Panasonic . If you already have a progressive player of good quality though , I would wait for Bluray or HD DVD players latter this year . Like most other reviews , the blacks are excellent on the Panasonic , much better than LCD . The colours are individually adjustable in the settings menu and seem pretty neutral when setup well .  
2	  Well , it has a variety of screwdrivers and other tools useful for working on your computer . In my case , I was disassembling a laptop , so some of the tools cannot be used because only desktop computers require them . But I can see how if I 'm assembling a desktop computer , they would come in handy . The only complaint I have is that since I was working on a laptop , some of the screws are too small to be used by even the smallest screwdriver in this set . That can be easily remedied by a $ 2 eyeglass repair kit from a local drug store , though . I really liked the yellow tool that allows you to pull small screwdrivers out of their sockets when unscrewed . I was looking at the other kit with a soldering iron , but decided that I 'd rather buy a higher quality soldering iron separately , so I went with this one . Can't imagine most people to have any problems with this set , except when working on laptops .  
2	  At the beginning , I personnaly thought it 's a bit expensive . Around $ 70 for a webcam ? It sounds too much , doesn't it . However , my friend who specilised in the PC hardware strongly suggested it to me and therefore I decided it to give it a try . The product is awesome ! All the friends who saw me in the new cam gave it excellent compliments . Pro : easy to carry and clip on the monitor or be placed on the stand ; perfect quality ; the software is very easy and convenient to use and entertaining ; Free carry-case to protect the camIt seamlessly works with Skype and supports the HD quality video communications . Cons : can't even think of one for now .  
2	  The product worked as advertised and arrived quickly , in time for our trip to the D.C. Well worth the money to have two batteries , though the battery life in the D90 , at least , is quite long anyway and you won't likely be chewing through batteries fast in normal operation .  
2	  This is a good recorder and player . I worked quite well . Amazon delivery was as good as could be expected .  
1	  I have bought the Epson Perfections Scanner V750 Pro , and it just will not work , all I get is the on off button blinks red , all the cables are connected correctly , but it still comes up with cannot connect to scanner . I am at a loss what to do , I have downloaded all the latest drivers , but it still will not scan , for something costing 800 and from Epson you would expect it to work . Do they have a fixit service ? Barry Pagebarry @ oldbricklayer . co . uk  
2	  If your in the market for blank DVD + R , this is the one for you . Everyone was perfect all the time . TDK 16X DVD + R 100PK Spindle  
2	  You get more than you pay for . Yes , the Tamron AF 18-200 is not the best all around lens out there , but for less than $ 200 , you get a very good lens , that can be used for pretty much any situation . Perfect fit for my Canon T3i and also ships with a lens hood . Taking very nice pictures thus far and will get the majority of my time , with using my T3i .  
2	  Beautiful cover , great quality , it looks like a nice case for a second camera , the magnetic clap is a very nice touch .  
1	  I have to say I 'm pretty disappointed with the Garmin GPS Navi . I would often lose satellite reception driving through the streets of SF and end up dazed and confused trying to follow it 's erratic directions . Not to say that having a GPS system isn't at times a life-saver , my Garmin was not something I would want to heavily depend on . On top of the poor reception and long route calculating time , the Garmin does not hold up to the test of time . I drove down to LA two weeks ago and it literally just " died " an hour into my trip . It shut down and no matter how I tried to resuscitate some life back into it , it refused to turn back on . The screen did a weird blinking thing , perhaps to show me that it was trying but knew things were beyond hope . Sadly , the warranty ran out the month before and now I have to chuck it and replace it with a new one .  
1	  I ordered this cable because it was a good price with FREE shipping . Cable was bad . Snowy picture , crackling noises . Not worth itto pay to ship it back to get another . Emailed the seller but go no response . Next time will just go to the store ! :(  
1	  I originally bought this CD holder because I needed somewhere to put my increasing cluttered CD 's after I lost my wooden box when I was forced to move . Now let me point out the obvious flaws that I was too stupid or lazy or inattentive to notice . For one , you cannot fit any " special " CD case in the slots because they are simply too big ; the slots are just big enough to snuggly hold onto only the most basic CD case and nothing else . So if you have any box sets or CDs that came with a paper sleeve or of the " fold-out " variety you may want to reconsider . Another issue I had was the fact that more often then once I was having trouble fitting the damned CD 's into the damned slots and was forced to get on my knees like a damned fool to see what the damned problem was . This required me to slowly guide the CD into place like a top secret alien craft into hangar 18 . This is NOT ergonomic design , unless you are Hitler . Well it 's not TOTALLY bad . Once you get the disks into the slots they 're not going anywhere . And you have the option of connecting several of these ghastly beasts together if you have a considerable collection of albums that need to be categorized and slotted and you don't mind having to keep your freak CDs separted from your more normal ones . Bottom line : You can find a better way to organize your music , even if it does cost a wee bit more .  
2	  I recieved the 12 db power unit instead of the 10 db , which is OK with me . In my situation this device helped by improving the reception with my HD tuner . However the difference in not extreme , but it is an appreciable difference that makes the TV much more watchable . I actually use two of these devices , one in the attic near the attenna , an another on the other end of the cable , on the ground floor near the TV . The result is that the TV is watchable and recieves most of the local channels . These devices are not expensive but the help they provided really made a difference in my installation .  
1	  I just had a second one die on me . The exact same thing - it worked for a while , then started giving fatal errors and erasing everything . Two of them in two years ? Forget it . The first time , I sent it back to Xircom and got a replacement . But if not used for a few months , it seems to start to melt down horribly . I recommend avoiding this at all costs .  
1	  I had my Pink iPod mini since Feb . 2005 . It was fine until it died the next year on the exact day I got it , and the warranty ran out . I got it repaired at an Apple reseller , and then it died again on the warranty expiration date . What is it with the iPods ? It 's like they have a self destruct inside ! ) :-(  
2	  I won't even try to write a review of the camera to top some of the extremely helpful ones already here , but hopefully a helpful hint to " newbies " to dslr like me , and a comment regarding a very pleasing discovery . First , the hint - I bought this without a case / holster initially , but you really do need one to protect it . I found that the Lowepro Topload Zoom 1 works great for the K10D with its supplied kit lens . Although the camera / lens does fit into the Lowepro Topload Mini , it does so just barely , with no room for the strap . So if you 're looking for an inexpensive bag , the Topload Zoom 1 works great . ( I 'm putting this comment under the camera because I figured if you 're looking at the K10D , it 's best to report on a bag under the camera 's heading , than randomly under the bag itself , which would take a lot more work to find ! ) . My comment has to do with the Pentax 's battery . I 've been incredibly impressed by its ability to hold a charge . I bought the camera over a month ago - charged the battery when I got it , and it 's STILL , one month later , indicating a full charge , despite having been in the cold , and I 've taken about 300 pix ( about 1/2 w / flash ) ! I 'd worried about charge " shelf life " because I sometimes go for several weeks w / o using a camera , then , with my P & S , find the battery dead when I need it . This camera , after months of pre-purchase comparing , definitely offers the biggest , best bang for the buck ! You won't be disappointed !  
2	  This eMachines T2825 is power packed and breaks away from the general misconception of emachines low quality computers . First off , the case is not flimsy , it is nice and sturdy and very modern looking . The blue halo around the powerbutton is nice . The computer is very powerful , featuring a AMD Athlon XP 2800 + which runs at 2.09GHz . The 2800 moniker means it should run at about intel 2.8GHz . Also has 512mb or 333mhz ddr ram which is supported by the mainboard . The processor 's FSB ( Front Side Bus ) and memory both run at 333mhz giving the computer good throughput . The mother board is an FIC AU31 custom board featuring the nVidia nForce2 Crush18G chipset , giving the T2825 plenty of speed and advanced features such as AGP8x , USB2.0 and Dolby 5.1 sound . The built in graphics are more than good enough for average user and light gamer , however serious graphics people will want to utilize that extra AGP 8x slot . The mother board auto switches over to the agp slot when a card is plugged into it , so you dont need to manually disable the built in GeForce4 MX . I personally recommend BFG video cards . I purchased an Asylum FX 5600 Ultra video card for my emachines T2825 and Play games such as Halo , Medal of Honor : AA , Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Half Life series quite comfortably with amazing graphics detail and speed . Despite emachines past record , this new machine ( in my eyes ) has redeemed them from a past of failure into a real competitor with a computer I can turn into what I want it to be . I love the machine and plan to buy another emachines for my next computer in between my life of building computers . By the way , if you price out the parts in this emachine , you will see that it is a great value for some quality hardware . Hope this helps any emachines skeptics .  
1	  I am not trying to save money by getting cheap 3rd part cartridges , I paid in full HP retail price ( same as newegg ) , and I have refunded it , glad that it is fullfilled by Amazon , so the return was simple .  
1	  I purchased the CX300 , because it came with different size ear buds . However I found that none of the buds would keep the earphones in my ears even when sitting . I finally had to remove the buds entirely but then found that there was no base although the sound was good . I guess I have large ears would you think ? They are inexpensive enough that I didn't send them back . If you have no problem with regular ear buds I feel sure that they would work for you .  
1	  The quality of materials is good , and the actual workmanship is fine , but the design concept is poor . The legs slide up inside the bottom section of the monopod and screw in , making it very awkward and time consuming to set up in the field . Also , it is not very stable and the legs are almost horizontal , which means the ground surface needs to be fairly flat for it to work securely . I understand this is not intended to be a real tripod , but I expected a little more support , especially for the cost . You also want to be careful not to pinch your fingers with the legs when you unfold them . I had mine for about 1 hour or less before packing it up for return . I bought the Trek-Tech 110 TrekPod II in its place , which is much faster and simpler to use in the field and costs less . It is not perfect either , but is more user friendly than the Manfrotto version and it seems to be more stable . It is my opinion that there is room in this market nitch for a really good design concept for a monopod with legs . One that requires only the push of a button for the legs to extend for basically hands-free setup in the field . But the best I 've seen so far is the TrekPod .  
1	  After light use ( less than once a week ) for under 3 months the sound began to cut out . I noticed it would cut out over 80 % of the time I was listening either entirely , or a large portion of the sound range would suddenly dissapear . Usually mid range ( vocals ) and below would cut out . If the cord was held just right it would come back for a few seconds but then cut back out . Also , they are slightly tight on the ears while wearing glasses .  
2	  I ordered 3 book holders official name would be Insight Adjustable Book & Copy Holders on the 20th of this month which was 2 days ago . According to the post they would arrive between the 25th and the 2nd of next month , but to my surprise they arrived today . Service was excellent ; shipping was impressive , over all I am one very happy customer . I would be happy to recommend this seller based off the service I received .  
1	  Bought this a long time ago before I bought an HDTV . I had been using bunny ears and a digital converter box on an old analog tv and got all the over-the air channels w / o any issue . Plugged this into my new Samsung LED and now only receive 2/3 channels , and they skip out and lose the signal on a regular basis . No fidgeting with placement or directing the antenna helps . This is a complete waste of money . Wish I could return it .  
1	  This is a hinder to you using your camera . Hard to attach a tripod to camera with the rubber flopping into the underneath of the camera . Fits like a glove - a baseball glove . The Rubber on the back covers all the buttons and makes all the buttons sloppy to push . Each change of the menu was an ordeal and a lesson in anger management . I ended up going underneath the rubber to get access to the controls . Nice try , but don't bother . I cut mine off with a razor so I would not be tempted to use it again .  
1	  I bought this to have another power brick for my Powerbook . It is very lightweight and looks nice . However , it does NOT put out thenecessary 65W for a 15 " or 17 " Powerbook . System Profiler shows it asa 45W power supply . If all you need is 45W , it is very light and has aan iPod dock connector charger as well . I should also note that the oneI got had a power tip for the Powerbook that was quite loose - it had tobe wiggled just right to even get the 45W .  
2	  This is excellent wire ; unlike some others , it is actually the gauge on the label . Good , heavy copper stranded wire protected by a clear and strong plastic sheathing . And it is priced fairly and honestly . I think it is the least expensive 14 gauge speaker wire here , but it is as good as the most expensive ( which are mind-bogglingly overpriced and hyped like the snake oil medicines of the 19th century ) . Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain , Dorothy , our gazillion dollar speaker wire will even clear up your acne and make you better in bed .. Sheesh . If only we had cared about education , maybe those con men would be unable to get rich selling their ridiculous speaker wire . Buy this wire . Enjoy the music and the money you saved by doing so .  
1	  Beware buying this product from the vendor " Citi Electronics . " They shipped me generic no-name brand cables , instead of the unique Cables-To-Go snagless custom boots . The " generics " are like typical Ethernet cables with the thick molded boot that fully encapsulates the plastic tab used to unlock the cable from a jack . I 've found trying to press on this thick " thumb bump " boot to push on the tab difficult to use and sometimes I have to pull the boot back in order to press directly on the tab to properly disengage it . It seems these generic boots are just too large and may actually be pressed up against the jack housing causing tension on the jack and making disengagement harder ( hence my need to peel back the boot or forcibly push the cable further into the jack to unload the tension on the tab ) . Which is why I now use the Cables-To-Go snagless versions as it uses a light and small vinyl flap that rests on the plastic locking tab to aid in disengaging yet allows easy unobstructed view and access to this tab to ensure you are properly disengaging it without adding any stress or tension to the connection .  
2	  When it comes to optical gear , I always prefer to go to shop and check everything by hand and eye , on actual camera . So , I went to shop to check this lens . I liked it , but all of 3 exemplars I 've tested , had noticeable vignetting on both wide and tele end . It is especially noticeable when filming uniformly colored objects . Generally , all lenses do vignetting and Sony camera firmware has internal correction for that , but it only " knows " sony lenses , so in case with Tamron , you 'd have to correct vigneting in post production . Overall , this lens is very sharp , and great improvement over the standard kit lens in terms of image quality . The image is a bit soft on wide end and open aperture ( still better than kit lens ) , and tack sharp at tele end even at fully open aperture ! So , it is not a great general use zoom lens , but also can be used for portraits at tele end . Another notice - since it has no built in motor , focusing is done via camera , and is a bit slow and noisy , making this lens less usable for Video . You also should note that , when filming the video , Sony AF system will set F number to 3.5 , regardless of your presets , so if you plan to buy this lens to get more light for video shooting , that won't help .  
2	  This cable is fantastic . I used the entire box in 50-100 ft runs . It came out of the box smoothly ( the box uses a real abs / pvc spindle ) , and the pairs separated quite easily . The colors are bright and apparent . When un-twisted , they line up or stay in position just they way you want them . After a bad experience of copperclad cable , I did use my utility knife to scrape some of the copper , and it is indeed solid , through and through . The cable slid effortlessly through a typical snarled maze of potential snags in a drop ceiling environment . Every run was 100 % problem-free . Based on this experience - I will be purchasing a 1000ft roll of this same product .  
2	  My wife asked me for an MP3 player or a portable music player . After looking around , I decided to buy the 4GB Ipod Mini ( silver ) . It will have plenty of disk space for over 1000 songs which is enough at a time for my wife , plus it is very light weight and includes a belt clip . The software , iTunes loaded and connected to our new ipod with the supplied firewire cable ( also includes a USB cable ) with our WinXP machine . The unit comes with a charger , but we it can also charge when connected to the computer ( save the charger for trips away from the computer ) . I ripped a few of our CDs into the iTunes software ( AAC format , 128 bit rate but you can use MP3 if you wish ) , and the quality is excellent , so now only about 200 more CDs to go but they rip pretty quickly and you can listen to the tracks while you are importing . The software easily syncs the tunes into the iPod . Many say that the iPod is about design and colors , which personally don't matter to me , but the iPod mini is also about function . The way you scroll through menus , adjust volume , etc . is soo slick and easy once you spend a few minutes with this machine . I love it so much , I have now convinced myself to also buy the 20GB machine for myself to hold all of our music .  
1	  I have the iGo Juice ^ 70 model PS0055 . This is a three-in-one adapter - AC , vehicle , airplane - that can power and charge your notebook computer . With an optional accessory , you can also charge another mobile electronics device , such as an MP3 player , a cell phone , or a PDA . In other words , the Juice can charge at most two devices : a notebook , plus one other small gadget . Unlike what some other reviews have said , the Juice cannot power / charge more than two things at a time . The Juice comes with 10 tips for a variety of notebook computer brands , from Compaq and HP to Fujitsu to Panasonic . Unfortunately and unforgiveably , no tips is included for the popular Sony and Toshiba notebooks . You can call iGo to request a free Sony - or Toshiba-compatible tip ; whether they 'll actually mail it to you is something I can't verify . ( There doesn't seem to be a way to make the request on their website . ) In addition to the heavy brick-style power converter / transformer ( " adapter " ) , you get an AC cord , a vehicle / airplane combination cord , and a notebook input cord . Let me explain . The AC cord and the auto / air cord bring source power to the Juice brick ; i.e. , you plug one of them into the approriate power outlet and also into the Juice brick . The notebook input cord then goes from the Juice to your notebook , with the correct power tip attached . Be sure to use the correct tip ! Not only is it a question of size and fit , but also polarity and probably also voltage control . Unfortunately , iGo 's tips are poorly made and there are many reports of poor fits . ( Everything in the package is made in China . ) ( Tip : even though the Juice comes with an insert of notebook compatibility charts , be sure to go to the iGo website for updated and correct compatibility check ! The charts have a number of mistakes . For example , it says my Fujitsu C2210 notebook should use Tip 11 , whereas in reality it 's Tip 3 that will work , something that 's correctly stated on the iGo website . ) On the notebook input cord is a connection point for an optional secondary powering system . You can buy one of these on iGo 's website for about $ 30 . With this and an appropriate tip ( another $ 10 , not included in the secondary system ) , you get a secondary adapter , i.e. , an adapter for the Juice adapter ! This secondary adapter then allows you to charge / power your cell phone or PDA or MP3 , one at a time , each with its own corresponding tip . For example , if I were to get a tip for my Sanyo SCP-8100 cell phone , I 'd have to buy an A02 tip , in addition to the secondary system ( which is called " DualPower Accessory for Mobile Electronic Devices " on iGo 's website ) . OK , the Juice works as advertised . It can get hot during operation . My gripe regarding its design is it 's rather bulky , like a brick , and a bit heavy at 7 oz . without the cords . The traveling weight - the brick plus the three cords - weigh at least a whole pound . iGo does give you a cheaply made pouch to store them . Now , if you get the secondary power system in order to charge / power another gadget , the secondary adapter will weigh at least 4 or 5 oz . , excluding its own power cord ! Again : out of box the Juice cannot power any cell phones , PDAs or MP3 players . You must purchase an additional secondary adapter and the right power tips . I simply cannot how some reviewers lied about or omitted this important hard fact about the Juice . My biggest gripe is how expensive this whole thing is . I paid over $ 100 for the Juice and the special tip for my Sharp Actius MM20 ultralight notebook . Then I found out in order to power my Sanyo cell phone or my HP iPaq Pocket PC PDA , I 'd have to buy a secondary adapter plus one tip for each ! The additional costs , and weights , can add up quickly . Not to mention the headaches of managing all the power tips . Let me say this : I regret my purchase of the iGo Juice . The small AC adapter that came with my Sharp Actius MM20 weighs a mere 2 oz . The AC adapter for my Sanyo phone is a mere 1 oz . Together they take up far less space and weigh far less than the Juice brick alone , not to mention I don't even have a secondary iGo adapter yet . Nor do I plan to buy one . ( So right now I can only charge one notebook at a time . I still need to carry the Sanyo and iPaq adapters . ) My advice : don't waste your money , seriously . If you need a vehicle adapter , get a cheap one from Radio Shack or direct from your otebook manufacturer . The airplane plug in the Juice package is useless as most modern airplanes accommodate regular power plugs . The Juice package , for its high price , doesn't even include world outlet adapters , so you can only use the AC cord in the U.S.A very poor value IMHO .  
2	  I BOUGHT AN RCA HDV 5000 FROM ICON OUTFIT ONJULY 13 th 2009 . WHEN I RECIEVED IT , THE BOX WASVERY TATTY BUT NOT OPENED . I OPENED THE BOX ANDIT LOOKS OK . NOW COMES THE BAD NEWS . I CALLEDUP TO GET THEM TO SEND ME THE UPDATE DISC , THEY TELL ME I SHOULD GET IT IN TWO TO THREEWEEKS , SO I WAIT & I WAIT . WHEN IT ARRIVES THEDISC IS SOME SORT OF HOME MADE COPY , BUT THE TWOPAGES OF INSTRUCTIONS THAT CAME WITH IT , YOU CANNOTREAD ANY OF IT ALL , SO NOW I WAITING FORA 2 nd SET TO GET HERE .  
1	  I read the reviews and bought one anyway , which was my mistake . It was brand new and like the review said the volume cut out completely at low settings . Never mind the possibility of the batteries leaking the sound from this unit is way too bright ; meaning it has far too much treble . The button functions also do not make sense . Buy a Logitech Pure-Fi Anywhere ( I did ) or an Altec Lansing IM9 .  
1	  I purchased this adapter to enable hook up of a scrolling sign . Cable does not recognize sign . After finding this out , I tried to remove software from my computer . It will not uninstall . Have tried everything to no avail .  
1	  This radio is awful . The sound is tinny , the selection dial to get the stations is so small and low that you can't see it . The speaker is on top and tipped to the rear so your sound goes that direction ! The time display is the only thing good about it . Have had mine 11 months and wish I could get my money back .  
2	  I bought this recorder to use as a audio journal and to jot down ideas for future writing projects . The folder function makes it easy to divide up these ideas and retrieve them . I am pleased with the sound quality as I don't expect it to be recording studio quality . It does the job for me . I do agree with others about the issues with noise from handling , the small switches ( I often have to put my glasses on to see the switches ! ) , and the sudden battery popping out bit . But all in all , I like the light weight , the features , and the amount of recording time . Much cheaper to buy this here than at Best Buy .  
2	  i had this radio for 1 day and it is the best i have ever hadthe noise reduction unit helps me pick up signals from up to 5 miles not four Five miles it is the best investment to buy two rite away !  
1	  I bought this product by reading some of the great features mentioned about this online . Also , I had earlier Dlink product which gave me little trouble but overall worked satisfactorily . But this product purchase is worst ever buy . This always gets disconnected and I have to reboot the router at least twice a day . I called the DLink company and their customer service is absolutely horrendous and junk . I called them thrice to get the problem resolved and those * holes just closed the call saying it is a problem with my internet service provider . If you are wise enough don't ignore my review and never try your luck against these Dlink products . It is just trash and I wasted my money on it .  
1	  I purchased this card five months ago and used it without incident . I was happy with the amount of space on the card . Suddenly today , for no apparent reason , a message came up saying " memory card error " . I cannot access the photos on my card with my external card reader . I cannot use the card in my camera . The photos on the card are lost , and that makes me quite sad .  
2	  all 5 of my lenses are covered by B & W. i have enjoyed German made products for their sheer quality and if that 's you , then you will appreciate this relatively expensive filter . it feels so good as the brass of this filter meshes with that lovely latest lens , that you won't care . tell you what , get the cheapy and screw it on , and then replace it with a B & W. buy it from Amazon and you can effortlessly return the one that you don't like or think too expensive . if you like the best , this is it .  
1	  I ordered this product to listen to my ipod in the car . I followed the instructions and tried it for a week , but was never able to listen to my music with out the static . I felt like I was listening to records . I wouldn't recomed this .  
2	  can't go wrong with good sounds and a great price ; use them for secondary set of stereo speakers in the living room , good crisp sound and sufficinet base , don't need a subwoofer for these .  
2	  Excellent product for the price and came in about 3 days ! Hooked them up and they sound great . Bass leaves you wanting , but with a few quick adjustments on my receiver we are good to go . Just ordered another pair for the backyard . Installed easily . Be sure to put them fairly close together , or at least facing the same direction .  
1	  I made the mistake of purchasing this router . File sharing , internet access and the wireless connectivity work fine but I use my home network for online games . I tried to configure my new router to allow me to act as a server for several different games . The online documentation is very sparse , as is the KB on the Netgear site . I sent a question to their support staff , asking for expanded documentation on port-forwarding . After getting a canned e-mail response asking for my serial number ( which I had already provided ) , I was told that this question " fell outside of the scope of support " , and I would have to pay $ 28.95 ( or $ 1.95 / min ) for " Premium Support " . This is almost 30 % of the price of the router itself for a single support incident . It 's too bad that 1 star is as low a rating as you can make . I will never buy another Netgear product again .  
1	  I got this gps two years ago , although it will work pretty well for a while , it will start tofreeze and you will have to reset it and lose all stored info in order for it to work again . But the main reason not to buy it is YOU WILL NEVER FIND ANY UPDATES , Even if you talk to a service rep from LG . FAIR WARNING . Buy a garmin .. At least you can depend on them . ART  
1	  The tech data section says it can play VCD , actually NO !  
1	  I know a lot of people have reviewed and liked this product . Perhaps it works for them , but I hate it . This set of headphones is already in the garbage . Why ? The sound quality is not nearly as good as the reviews led me to believe it would be . I have other headphones with much better sound , but that is not the primary reason that I dumped them . The wire placement for the headphones is in an uncomfortable place - in front of the ear-coverings , so the wires are over my cheeks as they drop down to my ipod . I would rather have the wires toward the back and out of the way . Also , I like to drop the wires down the back of my shirt to get them out of the way and hook my ipod onto my belt . The wires on these headphones are too short for this , and with the wire-placement , the wires cut across my neck when I tried wearing them this way . I have purchased two Koss products . I 've been disappointed with both . There will not be a third .  
2	  I recently purchased a Palm Vx , my first foray into handhelds . It was extremely easy to learn to use , and the software seems very logical .. so far there haven't been any " oh , I wish it would .. " and I have yet to consult the documentation , it 's so straight-forward . Best of all , it 's as though it was made for my Mac , instead of made for a PC and then translated . No more stray pieces of paper and thick datebooks for me . I also have 3 technical books loaded on it that I refer to several times each day at work .  
1	  What an incredible disappointment this product is . The copper strands inside the jackets are so thin , it 's almost impossible to strip the jackets off without cutting the copper strands inside . And even when you are lucky enough to finally strip the jacket off without cutting the copper strands , the strands are so thin that they do not stay together when you twist them tight so you can insert them into a speaker or A / V receiver .. the wires stray out in all different directions no matter how hard you try to twist them tight . Also , Belkin resorts to the deceptive practice of wrapping their middle strand with plastic sheathing to artifically increase the gauge rating without having to use more copper . The sound this wire produced was horrible . I ripped it all out of my walls right after installation and went with Monoprice cable and it was huge difference . Stay away from Belkin PureAV speaker wire .. it 's useless ! Try Monoprice 's speaker wire .. it 's half the price and three times the quality . I uploaded a photo comparison to the customer images area for this listing .  
1	  I hope I save somebody the time and trouble of buying this piece of garbage . As some of the other reviewers have experienced , mine starting acting up after three months . I was told by the manufacturer that for $ 80 I should send it back for a " reconditioned " one . Went to Mail Boxes Etc .. and sent it back . I received the " new " one about three weeks later and I am having the same problem with this one . The kicker of this whole mess was the woman at Mail Boxes Etc .. told me that sometimes the same people send the machine back three to four times ! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS !  
2	  I bought this for my husband for Christmas and all in all it lives up to the reviews that I had read before . I like that it is easy to use and set up . My only dislike is that I feel the maps it came preloaded with are out of date . We recently drove down to the coast of NC and there was a new bypass that has been open for a while . The preloaded map did not have the new road on it . We contacted Magellan who said an update only comes out about every 18mths and there is not one currently scheduled . Disapointing as we live in an area of large growth .  
1	  Didn't work with MTP AV and Mac OSX . 6 . Motu said it wouldn't either . I wasted my time and money . Might be a great buy for someone who has an older operating system . bah !  
2	  I got this camera about a month back when it just got released . Actually I was intending to get the 1300 model but decided to pay a little more and get the newer 2300 model . I 've compared with all other cameras around and must say this is one of the best deal you can get . It is very small , light & compact , fits easily into a coat pocket . The 4 AA batteries that it uses lasts a long time and with functions like self-timer , 5 modes of flash , red eye reduction , tripod mountable , macro mode , digital 2x zoom , USB connections . Pictures taken during the day are very clear & good , for night shorts or where places are dark , a steady hand is required . The only few disadvantages that I can think of is the camera lens can be scratch easily . ( If you look at the picture of the camera you 'll know what I mean ) . The other is if you gripped the camera tightly with your hand you can feel some kind of plastic sound , as if the body of the camera is not tightly screwed . The camera doesn't come with a case , so it 's advisable to get one , especially with its unprotected lens . All in all , I 'll give a all thumbs up for this model , Fuji Finepix 2300 !  
1	  I received this tripod as a birthday present . I set it up and used it to take one family photo . My daughter then walked by , slightly bumping one leg of the tripod . I was quite surprised to look at the tripod and find the leg badly bent . Tried to straighten the leg and it snapped right off . " Sturdy steel leg construction " the package says . HA ! Straight into the garbage it went after being out of it 's package less than 10 minutes . I 'll get a different brand next time .  
2	  great product . very versitile . Takes some time to get used to the software , but not really difficult after the first few times . Works with Windows 7 which is great . Support seems good too .  
2	  This thing was worth every single penny period . It is very loud , and it has many great features . I love that it has an HDMI output , it really helps in up converting standard definition DVDs . This thing has other great features , such as an Auxiliary input , Ipod dock , and USB port . The remote is easy to use and has a great layout . All of the speakers are labeled , and the wires are colour coded , so anyone can set it up without any problems . If you are looking for an all in one box set up , this is it . 11 months later I can honestly say , I would buy this again without hesitation .  
1	  The TomTom 720 a beautiful machine with a lot of cool features . But the routing is dreadful so often that we have to bring maps along - which kind of defeats the purpose of a GPS . Our older , cheaper , slower , not-very-beautiful Garmin is MUCH more reliable . We live in Eastern Pa . and do most of our driving here . The road network is very old and established so it is not a matter of out of date maps . It 's just the TomTom 's routing algorithm . If we 're not paying attention , the TomTom will take us 20 miles out of our way - and these are repeat incidents so I know it 's machine error , not user error . Even in our neighborhood , sometimes it inexplicably has us go in completely the wrong direction and takes wildly circuitous routes . If you know where you 're going , and you 're just using the TomTom for the last 1/4 mile , the neighborhood streets , this machine can't do you much harm . But for longer trips I just can't trust it . Extremely disappointing for a $ 300 machine - and the more we use it the more we dislike it . I think our $ 300 TomTom is going to get replaced by a $ 100 MIO pretty soon .  
1	  I bought one of these for my parents . I purchased it from Amazon merchant ANTOnline . It does not work . ANTOnline has my money and shipped me a complete piece of junk . I took what money I had left after I foolishly blew around $ 250 on this piece of junk that doesn't work and adopted a dog to alert my parents when a car is coming up the driveway . He was a lot cheaper and works a lot better than the wireless probe kit . I guess we all live and learn .  
2	  This is the ONLY screen protector that fits the new Palm Tungsten T3 . All of the others are slightly too short . So , it 's simple : If you want a screen protector to protect your T3 , this is it .  
2	  This Display takes the best value for money award in my opinion . I 'm using it with DirecTV HD reciever . The picture is no different to my Sony 60 " Grand Wega monstor display that costs about more than 3 times . Actually , the picture is much brighter . I have lots of direct sunlight in my room from large windows . But , still able to see a very good picture . From an easthatics perspective , I liked the look of some of the other displays , but the picture quality and price is what made me go with this device . The product has more than exceeded my expectations . I 'm not yet using the built in HD tuner so can not comment on its quality . I did use the Olevia WM20D wall mount plate and it sits very flat against the wall . The DirecTV remote did not have the Olevia TV as one of its choices . But , any of the Yamaha model remote codes / programs seem to work .  
1	  If this worked , it would be great . Unfortunately , it doesn't . Even with the unit placed on top of the radio ( a high-end JVC - some reviewers have mentioned that reception was dependent on the quality of the FM receiver ) , it was still filled with static , and sounded cheap ( which admittedly , the iPod is ) . I don't know if it 's worth the postage to return it to Amazon . From all I 'm reading , it might work well if you 're in an uncrowded FM area ( but I wouldn't bet on it ) .  
2	  Very happy with this product , no more playing with the radio to find a clear station . Due your research though I installed mine in under 30 min in my 2007 nissan frontier , no xtra adapter needed , plug and play . I bought one for my buddy and he spent 2hrs going to radio installers looking for antenna adapters for his Tahoe , not sure if this is specific to GM .  
2	  showed up on time works well , came packaged nicely . no problems with this product at all . more cost effective than going to the store .  
1	  The product was received in a timely manner but was the wrong color . I ordered a Grey leather case and received a Black leather case .  
2	  This CD-MP3 player doesn't have a remote , and does not charge batteries with its AC jack . It does not have a very useful equalizer , the settings make little difference . Reviewers say you cannot run with it , you can't , but you can sure ride the stationary bike without skipping once , and I could walk at a moderate pace on the treadmill with it in my belt pouch . Although I haven't weight-lifted with it yet , weight-lifting is also probably ok since it is usually as low impact as walking . It cannot search within a song in Mp3 mode , it can on an audio CD . It has a good customizable backlight ; It has good sound quality ; it has a playlist which creates itself as you play songs ; It recognizes any kbps I have used so far ; it responds instantly , unlike other players ; the search function is more than useful ; the software it comes with is MusicMatch 6.0 and TDK Navitrack , with Navitrack you have to edit each song manually , but once you link it to your burner it installs the descriptions exactly as you listed it in Navitrack , ex . Artist-Title-Genre . mp3 If you name the tracks like this with the hyphens , it will list the songs in any of those 3 catagories , including ANY word you use for genre ! All you have to do is make sure you put in the exact same artist spelling to have all songs by that artist , and genre , etc . The manual edit is a pain , but you only have to do it once for each song , if that ; it has a line OUT ; it has a HOLD button ; of all the CDs I tried , it only had trouble with a single burned mp3 disk , all other mp3 disks were perfectly recognized . All in all , for [ the price ] and a .. rebate , I love this thing . The funnest thing is having all your songs in the directories you want , Navitrack puts them in perfect , as entered . Having the Creative Nomad will prolly feel better at first , but later when you see how hard it is to use the thing , ex . slow controls , the expensive models may not seem so great after all . The Creative may have more features , but this Mojo is just such a solid and easy to use product , that you probably will not be able to bring yourself to return it for a more [ costly ] model because you like it so much !  
1	  This switch is garbage .. ( as is all linksys switches ) . We own this and many 5 and 8 port switches . Every single on when the power goes out must be manually powered off and powered back on . Linksys 's terrible technical support says it is normal .. How is that normal ? DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE .. YOU WILL BE SORRY !  
1	  I bought this to listen to my SansDisk Sansa MP3 play thorugh my car radio . The signal amplification so weak I have to turn the volume of both my car radio and the MP3 player to max to hear anything at all , and it 's faint and fuzzy . In fairness , maybe the output of the MP3 player is faint , but it works fine through the headphones it came with . I have no choice but to return the unit .  
2	  I have the original Zire , and then Zire 22 for years . I have changed phones many times through out the years , but not this little palm . This little thing is most reliable . It is very light weight and keeps me organized , no maintenace and cheap . The battery seems last forever - weeks or months which I loose track  
2	  I 've been working on a 365 photo project since February of 2009 and I found myself encountering difficult shooting challenges . For those of you not familiar with 365 shots , the goal is to take a self-portrait of sorts every day for a year . The shots can be part of your body , face , finger , shadow , etc depending on who 's rules you follow . Anyhow , arm 's length self portraits and perfectly synchronized self-timer shots get really old really fast . This remote was just what I needed ! I shoot with a D80 and the 18-200VR lens . The shutter release offers me so much more freedom with my shots . I especially like the timer delay release when I push the trigger and it goes off seconds later , not sure if that is unique to my camera ) . This gives me the opportunity to point the remote at the camera and then stash the remote out of view . Shutter release time is pretty speedy when I push the remote buttom . Sometimes I have trouble juggling the focusing process when using the remote . I can pre-focus by depressing the shutter release halfway or adjusting the manual focus and then firing the shot with my remote . As far as I can tell , the remote will not initiate the auto-focus mechanism on its own , too bad . This can be troublesome with self portraits when I am the subject that I 'd like my camera to focus on . I also I wish the remote did not have to NOT have to be in a direct line of sight with the sensor . Sometimes my long lens gets in the way . Overall , I have been extremely pleased with this product and I would recommend it to all my friend with compatible cameras . It is small , lightweight and very easy to use . It has vastly expanded my composition opportunities . I even at times will hold the camera in one hand ( in some precarious way that doesn't allow me to press the shutter release directly ) so then I fire the shot with the remote . It works like a dream . PROS : small , lightweight , easy to set-up and use , decent response timeCONS : needs direct line of sight to fire the shutter , focus is only possible from the camera body itself and not the remote  
1	  There was nothing easy about this install nor was the support very helpful . Long story short I returned the product and purchased an Airlink 101 . The Airlink installed flawlessly .  
1	  I purchased a Palm TX in Nov 2008 and an extended warranty from N.E.W. Unfortunately , despite my hardcase , my screen cracked when I dropped it . I called N.E.W. , was told the cracked screen was covered under my policy , and was promised a return label would be emailed to me . The next day , I had not received it , and I emailed customer service ; however , I did not receive a response . On the third day , I called again . I was informed my file could not be accessed without my contract number , even when I not only told him it had been accessed two days prior without the contract number , but also gave the case number I had been assigned that day . At one point , he even asked me why my name field was blank on his screen . Of course , I had to point out I had no idea since I did not work for his organization . I finally asked to speak with a supervisor . His exact words to me were " She is going to tell you the same thing I am . " Despite this inane remark , I again asked to speak with a supervisor . Although this employee did at least appear to be competent , she informed me the first employee I spoke with who had told me the Palm would be repaired under the policy was incorrect . When I asked exactly what was covered by the policy , she responded only the electronics if it suddenly stopped working . I told her of my past few days of experience with N.E.W. When asked for the names of the people with whom I had talked , I told her I assumed an organization of the size of N.E.W. tracked that information on their computer system . In fact , she not only knew the names of the 2 people besides herself with whom I had spoken , but she saw the email correspondence which was never answered . Finally , I told the supervisor I could understand why N.E.W has such low ratings on Amazon . DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR MONEY . They are incompetent . Amazon needs to quit selling such a poor product .  
1	  The price looked right , but as others have mentioned this receiver has :* a poor layout for inputs , * a terrible manual , * a difficult remote , Sony is coasting on their name with this one . In addition , after a period of full , normal operation the unit began to go into " Protect " mode .. there was little information available ( not in the manual ) , so I began troubleshooting , as recommended in some online forums , by removing all connections - and found that the unit still entered " Protect " mode with nothing else ( components , speakers , etc . ) connected .. power on .. protect mode . Very frustrating to have no information from Sony . This " Protect " issue taken with the other afforementioned and unrelated design and documentation faults led me to return the unit and go in a different direction . I spent a little more and purchased a Pioneer VSX-1015TXK ; I have been much happier with the Pioneer unit . I also considered the Harman Kardon AVR 240 , but this Pioneer has proved to be a winner . I recommend you stay away from Sony until they get it right .  
2	  I haven't used the battery very long . It is a larger battery than the previous battery making the camera a little heavier , but it worked well with my camera . I can use the old charger that came with the camera and it gives me at least 2 more hours of recording time . The price was great considering the fact that a two hour battery was going to cost me more than this 4-6 hour battery . I am happy with the purchase so far . I did not want to spend much for the battery replacement , since video is moving to HD .  
1	  The feel of this keyboard is awesome . The design of the keys is unlike most keyboards . They just feel more comfortable to the touch . It 's got great multimedia / web / office hot keys ( which I never used ) . It 's really got more than most people need . The mouse is superb . It 's the most comfortable and best tracking mouse I 've ever owned . Fortunately it 's still great 6 months after I purchased it . I can't say that for the keyboard . A number of the letters on the keys began to wear 5 months after I got it and by 6 months it got quite noticeable . This is unacceptable for a keyboard that 's not even a year old . I bought this keyboard / mouse to replace a previous keyboard / mouse I had ( also logitech cordless - older model ) . I had the same problem with that keyboard except it only took 3 months to wear . I don't know what 's wrong , but the quality of Logitech keyboards has plummeted in recent years . I bought a Logitech corded keyboard in 1999 and I didn't notice key wear till it was 5 years old . That is acceptable to me . 5 months is not . I cannot recommend Logitech keyboards for this reason . I purchased a replacement for this one , but I 'm still using the excellent mouse . The new keyboard is not a Logitech and so far so good ..  
1	  I had an old 75 ohm ' ? adapter that has 2 screws for wires ( antennas ) and 1 coax to hook to the TV . It works better than this HDTV Powered Antenna . Seriously , I can unplug the power and there isn't a noticable difference . You 'd almost be better off sticking an unbent paperclip in your coax jack and call it good ( Yes that works if you 're TV isn't against a metal wall ) . Wm  
2	  I bought one of these little mp3 players several years ago from QVC , and wanted to buy another one for my grandson . I looked everywhere but couldn't find one like mine , until I checked out Amazon , looking for it . I shoulda checked here 1st ! Amazon 's got everything ! I can't believe this little bitty thing holds about 500 songs ! And it works great ! Now my grandson is jammin ' away with his new mp3 player ! Thanks Amazon !  
2	  These have both good sound and reception , you just need to make an effort adjusting on the right channel . Use good quality cable between source and base to eliminate noise . Range can be very good , depending on where you put the base station ( away from tv and other electronics ) . Battery life are long , even after not seeing any use for a couple of months and not connected to mains it works . Well worth 100 $ I guess . Sound quality that are a bit " tighter " than a Grado sr-60 headset .  
1	  these fall out of your ears when you sweat a lot like I do when running i have tried all the different combinations of the ear thingys and they just dont stay in  
1	  I have to give them an A for effort , but this product is not ready for prime time . With a little practice you can get very good recognition , but it is * so * slow as to be unusable . I know , you 're thinking " this is really cool , who cares if it 's a bit slow - I just want to take a few notes here and there .. " - that 's what I thought , but * NO * don't do it .. it 's so painful to scan more than one line that a paragraph is just not worth it . I forced myself to use it for one book .. I was really motivated and I did scan nearly everything I wanted at maybe 98 % accuracy .. but I wouldn't do it again .. just too painful . The user interface , while interesting , is also too limited .. you either have to create a new " file " for every scanning session ( hard to manage ) or painfully scroll to the bottom of your text each time you turn it on ( as one would do frequently when using it a lot ) . I really think this will be a killer tool when it can scan with continuous recognition .. and maybe multiple lines at a time so that you don't have to be as precise .. ( the OCR could sort it out ) . I 'm selling mine on ebay anc checking again in a year or two . Pat Niemeyer  
2	  I purchased this for my son for Xmas ( he was 2 at the time ) so that he would be able to keep occupied with a DVD wherever we go . It is simple to use , and he can change dvd 's and play them all my himself . I love the little stand to prop up the dvd on a table for easy viewing . Believe it or not , ir has stood up to a 2-year 's abuse quite well .  
1	  Not only did this machine fail to play my DVDs but it made a clicking sound when the DVDs were put in there . It only plays music CDs . This machine does everything BUT play DVDs . My advice to you is to never buy a remanufactured product , spring for the few extra dollars your peace of mind will be worth it in the end . I am still waiting on Amazon to either replace the player or give me back my money .  
1	  At first I thought that this camera was wonderful BUT it has a lot of things wrong with it .. 1 . It is NOT for fast picture taking , it takes a lot of time for the shutter to close ! 2 . If you don't have an arm made of stone then you will get extremely blurry night shots . 3 . Goes through battery EXTREMELY quickly4 . There is a very slow rebooting time between shots5 . Zoom is choppy and hard to use6 . Only some of the photos come out when uploaded7 . Without the flash the pictures are very , very blurryBut this camera is extremely easy to use just take it out of the box and use it .  
2	  Unless you plan to stop watching television altogether ( and be honest .. you aren't , are you ? ) , then you need Tivo . Why spend an hour watching a program that has upwards of 30 minutes of commercials in it ? Why watch the SAME commercials over and over .. and over ? Why miss your favorite programs or be forced to choose between watching them and going out to eat ? With Tivo , your time becomes your OWN again . Too busy to watch a favorite show ? Just Tivo it and watch it when you want . Hate those annoying commercials ? Tivo the show and you can fast forward right through them .. or just pause the show till the commercial break is over . Need to take a bathroom break at the climax of a movie ? With Tivo , you just pause the show and come back to it after you 've taken your break - and you won't miss a thing . But most importantly , you have much more of your time back again .. not as much as if you stopped watching television completely , but how many of us are that spartan ? And if you are , you don't need Tivo , you need a nomination for sainthood instead .  
1	  I would have given this piece of junk 0 stars but that seems to be impossible . It collapsed while I was fixing a TV and I landed flat on my back . ( Only my bad reflexes kept me from hanging on to the TV and have it fall on me ) . For a device rated at over 300 lbs this piece of equipment is truly GARBAGE . My wife , present when I took my fall , wanted me to sue the daylights out of the manufacturer but I am not the suing type and my mid back is beginning to feel better . DO NOT BUY THIS !  
1	  I was unable to use the product as it was not compatible with the Sigma lens I had . The product description offered did not detail compatability . If it had I would have known not to order it . I must say however that I have used Sigma lenses for years and found them to be of the highest quality I was just unable to use this one .  
2	  The browser-based configuration of this unit is poorly thought-out and buggy , but once configured , it 's solid . For example , you can't skip the setup wizard and just jump to the advanced settings . And you can't set WPA via the wizard . So you have to run the wizard first , and select WEP or open mode , complete the wizard , and then go to the advanced options and set WPA . It mysteriously took many attempts before the settings were actually saved . Once I finished the configuration , the unit connected to my D-Link DWL-7100AP access point using WPA-TKIP , and has been operating for about a week now without interruption . I am using it with the XBOX Media Center Extender , and it 's been able to keep up with streaming audio and video .  
2	  So far , so good . This cable seems to work just fine . Definitely a bargain , especially with free shipping ! I figured I had nothing to lose at this price !  
1	  My dell Photo 964 and this server weren't compatible . I think it is my printer 's problem not the server 's .  
1	  A brief update to the following : It looks like this ( 4.0 GB ) Data Traveller , flash drive is not usable with Mac OS 10.4 ( Tiger ) and 10.5 ( Leopard ) , but it works fine with the pre-release version of 10.6 ( Snow Leopard ) . Maybe the drivers need some rework . I expected satisfaction from a company like Kingston - they have a good reputation to defend , from their RAM DIMM products . But none of my Macs - Intel or otherwise - running various versions of OS X 10.4 and 10.5 - have been able to mount this 4.0 GB Data Traveler flash drive . The Mac 's Disk Utility has not been able to Erase it , citing " Permission denied " as the reason . It is looking more and more like I 'll have no option but to write it off .  
2	  Use these sheets for everything ! My latest use is sealing the recipes I print from computer sites , just trim and file in recipe box ! .  
1	  I bought this product to use in the car . It only has 4 bands and in the Bay Area does not work well .. there are too many radio stations that interfere . I used it in Europe over Christmas and it worked perfectly as there were no stations interfering with one of its channels  
1	  I bought this for $ 500 cash for my husband as a gift . Worked great for a little over a year . One day we start the car and it was completely dead . Nothing worked . Screen black . No response . I looked up online to troubleshoot ( maybe a cable wore out ) and I come to find out dozens & dozens of people with the same problem that have already tried to replace parts of it and pretty much just told me save your money , don't bother , buy something better . Basically Crap .  
1	  From the 10 burns , 6 of the disc were bad . Must have been a bad batch of blanks .  
1	  This little gem worked great the first time I hooked it up to my computer . When I got time to put on some more songs and recharge my computer would not even acknowledge the player . I could not add or remove music and then the player would not even turn on . My son and daughter both have different brands of players and they both work so I know it is not my computer . I sent it back and am in the process of looking for something else .  
2	  Like many of the reviews here have stated I also was on the lookout for just this kind of cable to use with my iPod Classic via home stereo system . Received it last week and it 's everything I hoped it would be . Can't beat the price and the sound through the stereo is very very good . Great buy !  
1	  I am in Chicago wher there is a channel 20 broadcasting DTV on channel 21 . I receive all channels with this antenna except channel 21 . Th antenna delivers most of the channels from the same transmitter location as channel 21 , so the aim is correct . It is relatively blind to this channel only . I just had the cables and connections replaced by an installer to make certain that everything else was OK  
2	  Excellent device but the backup software is not very friendly . The instructions to use the program are nor clear enough  
1	  I have two of these cables and have been dissapointed so far . The cable is pretty stiff making it harder to plug in . Now that i have the cables plugged in , because of the stiffness the outer cover is coming apart . As other people have mentioned , the gold plated cover on the end has fallen off of both of my cables . somehow i managed to put them back on and continue to use the cable but im sure this will affect quality over time , most likely leading to the cable not working at all . The cables work just fine and give good quality picture , they are just cheaply made .  
2	  This is a small piece of equipment but it is really important to have on many occasions for taking the best photos .  
2	  I have had this little guy for just about 3 months now and am loving it to the Nth degree ! It is light and compact , weighting in at just about 5oz , I believe . The interface between my computer and the Zen has been flawless , though the only way to charge the Zen is by installing the software onto the computer you are using . This is a slight downfall in that if you are visiting friends , and forgot to bring the disk with you , you may run out of battery life . However , the battery is removable in this particular Zen , so if you happen to purchase a battery charger that fits this little guy , then you should be good to go . This was a selling feature for me as I like to travel quite a bit internationally , and finding a random computer that doesn't cost $ 3 / min to use to charge my music player can be a toughie sometimes . That , and the fact that it is black with pretty blue neon lights . What can I say , I am color oriented . I have not had any trouble navigating through the options , thought to be perfectly frank , I have not really explored too many of them either . I have not tried to load up any pictures as I bought this primarily for the music purpose . The earphones that the item came with are not too bad . Not the greatest , and they do make the music a bit muffeled , but in a pinch they work just fine . I also bought the armband and have decided that it was worth the $ 6 so far .  
1	  Great sound , but the cord is too short , even if you use an MP3 player on an armband . If you turn your head while exercising , you will pull the left ear bud right out . The right one has a longer cord and will hold . They do give you an extension cord , but it is too long and the connection point is too heavy . The excess weight will also pull on the earbuds and the left one ( with the shortest slack ) will come out . On a five-mile ride / run I had to readjust this set several times . If not for the amazing sound , I would have given this product just one star . It would be a good set of headphones if you listen to music while lounging indoors .  
2	  After opening the product you can see it is of high quality . some cables do not use twisted pairs . This cable has twisted pair wires . Good cable for the money . Package arrived on time and in good condition  
1	  It 's a very nice and portable mouse , when I bout this mouse , I did for two things , the brand ( GE ) and price . but after a couple of months always happen that windows show me a message " a USB device it doesn't work properly " and after that mesage the mouse was freeze " . Now I Need to buy other one , but never a GE mouse .  
2	  the less there is to say about a switch the better . Thus , i 'll just say that the build quality is solid , metal not plastic , and i 've yet to have a problem .  
1	  For $ 120 I was expecting some sense of durability , that Shure wasn't just another Sony , and that the money spent would go towards materials that didn't fall apart after 3 months of use . I bought a pair back in March ' 08 to replace some buds that I 'd used for over 5 years . 5 years may seem like a long lifespan for consumer electronics nowadays but I 've owned to pairs of buds that lasted that long without any problem . The Shures sound great and do a decent job of blocking out sound . The variety of sleeves for the drivers guarantee a good fit without discomfort and the sound is good enough considering the size of the driver themselves . Today I noticed my first major problem . Either the aforementioned weight of the cord or cheap materials used in the insulation itelf has caused small stress cracks in the cable that loops over my ear , cracks that will only worsen in time and lead to the complete deterioration of the insulation around the copper . This is incredibly unsatisfying and only serves to drive me back to a cheaper brand . I 'm never paying this much for headphones again . Judging on sound alone I 'd give these Shure 's a solid four stars . But seeing as how they are rapidly growing ugly cracks in the insulation before even four months have passed , they fail any kind of value test . I 've paid a quarter of the price for Aiwas that lasted 5 years . It 's infuriating to see my Shures fail me like this .  
1	  This paper , although stated as a good quality paper is not good for presentations . The fact that it is VERY think makes it very easy to be damaged . The slightest movement of the paper when placing it in the paper feed slot can easily dentthe photo . If you are looking to print stuff that you do not really care about so much thanthis paper is for you . If you are looking to print photographs that you may want to look goodthan DO NOT USE THIS PAPER . Use a 5 star rated paper . I have about 100 pages now of paper that Ido not want . The box states that this paper is thick , but it is not . And when comparing it to otherpapers the Premium papers are much better and more worth your money to buy .  
1	  We got this to play tapes for our babies because it looks reasonably appropriate in their nursery yet has decent sound quality unlike typical tape players for babies . Unfortunately it has this annoying bright flashing display that comes on at random times when the unit is turned off , e.g. at night when the babies are supposed to be sleeping . I 'd imagine people of any age would be bothered by this light flashing in their bedroom every night . It flashes random colors for several seconds then the word " .. HELLO . " scrolls across the display . When it gets to the end it wraps around and for an instant it says " O. . HELL " which is exactly what I 'm thinking : " oh hell , the idiotic radio is flashing again ; I better unplug the piece of junk before it wakes the kids " . IMO , a product that you have to remember to unplug after every use is unacceptable . -BillP.S. Product developers everywhere take note : You have to wonder why Sony added this " hidden feature " . Presumably it 's to make the product stand out while on display in a store ( but my kids ' room at 2am is not a store ) and to call attention to a useless " advertised feature " of this boombox : the display can light up in different colors ( I guess it can be red when you 're playing a CD and green for the radio and orange for tapes or something like that ) . Oh boy . My guess is Sony had a perfectly good boombox design on the drawing board , then some over-eager engineer came along and said " we can get red / green / orange LEDs for only 5 cents more than plain red ones " and it all went downhill from there . A plea to engineers everywhere : don't add useless features just for the sake of adding features . You may think you 're showing off but you 're just being an idiot . This could 've been a good product .  
1	  How do you ship the printer essentially overnight and don't ship the USB cable necessary to connect it to my computer for a week to 10 days ? That is unacceptable .  
1	  Do NOT be deceived by the title . The product you get is NOT made by Sima . It 's actually done by Adorama . And here are the differences : ( i ) string is not as long as the original Sima piece ( ii ) instead of providing a solid disc at one end , the disc is actually covered by a sticker ( ii ) the sticker is hardly sticky . The general build is much poorer than the same thing from Sima . Do not be cheated by Adorama . In fact , it 's better to buy from B & H ; than Adorama .  
1	  Did not work on my system . Memory sticks and flash cards gave not enough power warning .  
2	  Domke bags and pouches are so well designed and made that they life-long items that really work . This pouch is attached to the shoulder strap of my camera bag and carries a large flash ( Canon 550 ) and battery pack . Taking those out of my bag allows me to use a much smaller bag ( also a Domke ) and quickly remove it if necessary ( to leave at home )  
2	  This is a really great addition to my Handspring Prism . It basically turns your PDA into a compact laptop . I use it for typing my schedule ( with 3 kids and being a graduate student there is a lot of that ! ) , typing my notes for class ( and in class ) , making study guides , flashcards , etc . I take it when we have to wait and my 6-year old uses it for letter recognition ( so it 's really sturdy ) . I love it .  
2	  Pleased with both Amazon and the TV . Delivery was prompt , professional and free ! Television is great . Nicest thing about it is that the engineers clearly put some thought into the user interface . It 's simple , intuitive , and elegant . Picture is wonderful , basic sound is a little better than expected . I looked at plasmas for about 2 months - this was the right choice .  
2	  Excellent product , highly recommended , very crisp and high contrast image ! Very pleased with the delivery as well , the box was in excellent condition .  
2	  Am happy with the performance of this router so far . Have not had any issues .  
1	  After the player arrived , it was set up and ready to run in only a few minutes . Then I put in a dvd . Talk about slow . It seemed to take more time to start the disc than it took to hook up the system . When the movie finally did start , I was delighted . The sound and picture quality were excellent . I found the remote to be very easy to use , and the zoom control was fun to play with . Then I put in a second movie , Disney 's " Atlantis " , and the player would not read the menu . I 've tried three copies of the same movie from Blockbuster , but the player simply can't read this movie . The assistant at Blockbuster even played the movie on the store dvd player for me . It played without a hitch . I don't know if the problem is with my particular player , or with the design of this model . Tried to get in touch with Toshiba product support by email . It 's been three days , and nothing . So take care if support after the sale is important to you . Thank goodness for Amazon 's return policy .  
2	  I just got this flash in last week with the Sto-fen diffuser . Great combo , if I don't want to light up the whole room with the diffuser I just angle the flash and bounce it . In the beginning , I considered the 430EX but figured it 's only a little bit more . Plus , I didn't want to have a great flash like the 430EX then go through the " What if I got the 580 instead ? " This is a powerful flash , I highly recommend it .  
1	  I wanted to use it as an external drive for my 91gb of music between my mac laptop and my pc . Just to find out you can not do this . You van only have your ipod formated to one-pc or mac-not both . Sound quality is a little worse than my older 30gb video ipod . So I kept my older ipod .  
1	  I 'm giving this keyboard one star because ultimately a keyboard primarily needs to have keys that are comfortable for me to use and don't impede my input . I found the keys on this keyboard to be way too " spongey " , meaning that the keys press down quite a ways then don't spring right back up .. It was akin to walking through quicksand , if that makes sense .. I found myself having to press the keys harder , and that would then slow down the next key press . Strongly suggest you try this one out in the store !  
2	  I purchased this scanner to scan thousands of film strips and slides from an old family archive . So far I have only scanned 300 + 35 mm b & w negative film strips . At the 4800 resolution , it takes about 1 hour to scan 2 strips of 6 pictures each . While it is going to take me quite some time to get through all of the pictues , I have been very impressed by the scanner . It generally autodetects the strips very well , though there are some tricks I 've picked up for partial strips or strips with " missing " pictures ( basically place the strip as far from the hinge side of the mounting bracket as possible , paper filler typically not needed ) . One thing that surpised me is that my home theater cannot play such high resolution pictures . I have resorted to using ImageMagick to convert the pictures to lower resolution to be able to display on the system ( knowing DOS commands helps here ! ) .  
1	  These headphones are no good . The technical details say that they have a 6-foot cord . In actuality it 's about 3 feet . When I use them with my computer the background interference is terrible . I had to return them .  
1	  This cable works fine with my Nano but no sound when connected w / my IPhone .  
2	  Inexpensive , no notable flaws , does the same thing a Monster cable would do for 10th of the price . At this length , you don't need to worry about signal degradation or anything like that .

1	  The ergonomics of this trackball are just plain awful . The design fails to accommodate left handed users and the Kensington Orbit Trackball with Scroll Ring is far superior . A trackball is for ease of usage and should be centrally placed for a good reason , Logitech has a total dud here . I gave them feedback , but no response , of course . Buy a decent trackball rather than this joke , please , the earlier Marble Mouse from Logitech is far superior , but Kensington easily beats it .  
1	  There is something wrong with the DHCP server on this router . Even after upgrading to the latest firmware , the DHCP server constantly drops the IPs from my computers . I can be in the middle of surfing , playing games over the net or even mid-download , the DHCP server will attempt to renew and drop the internet connection . The LAN will still be operational , but the internet will suddenly be inaccessible . The support page only offers " reset everything .. " which is ludicrous . A person should not have to constantly return to the router to reset it manually . I end up resetting the router 3-4 times a day . I had a Linksys 802.11b router and gave it away to my brother when I upgraded to G. I seriously regret that now . This Netgear is the most finicky / exasperating router I have ever encountered . I will never buy from Netgear again , and will now spend more money for a new Linksys g rouiter .  
1	  Lost my original charger so bought this one . Turns out you have to put the battery in upside down to line up the little metal + / - chargers . Not only that , but the battery won't make contact with the charging elements without shoving several thick pieces of paper or cardboard into the front where there is a little ridge to hold it in . Doing this it finally worked but it 's a hack to get it to work . Definitely wouldn't buy again .  
1	  Dont be cheap like i was , spend the extra 100-200 bucks and get a better system . This worked good for 3 months and then the sound just got worse and worse .. im going for the oknoyo system .. wish me luck !  
2	  The product didn't have good dimensions stated in the description , so I went with the assumption that it was linked to the camera I was buying it must be the right bag . I was right . I bought a Kodak easyshare z1012 which is a bigger camera than the pocket point & shoot but it fit fine once I got the angle right . The extra zippered space on the bottom is perfect for batteries & SD cards & even some ID if you 're stretched for space . It is small enough to be unobtrusive but still keep the camera safe with its extra padding . The belt loop is vecroed so you don't have to strip off the belt to thread it through . Works well & I am pleased .  
2	  Canon PowerShot SD600 6MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical ZoomThis camera 's LCD screen became unusable within 2-3 months of use-it has a break that shows clearly across the screen . My daughter says it has not been dropped and had no major temperature changes . It does take good pictures , but we have to use the viewfinder .  
1	  This is one of Logitech 's cheapest wireless desktop items , and the quality shows it . The keyboard is functional , but the keys sometimes feel a bit squishy and less than responsive . The media keys are cheaply-made , and some of mine are already loose even though I 've hardly used them . The mouse is by far the worst mouse I have ever used : it feels sluggish , is not particularly ergonomic , and worst of all , both buttons squeak with each click . I suspect this last part has to do with a badly designed battery holder , which seems to grind against the inside of the casing whenever the buttons are clicked . In terms of overall bang for your buck , it 's not much buck , but even less bang . I 'd suggest one of their higher-end products if you want to go with the wireless desktop .  
2	  Great lens at a great price . Used as a replacement for a simmilar lens , and can't say enough about it .  
1	  Simply put , I received the battery , charged it , installed it in my MD-10 and immediately my Nikon D700 battery charge indicator started blinking , while indicating no charge for the battery pack .  
1	  Like other owners , my roommate 's Philips 37pf .. 0A / 37 broke after only two years . It worked in the morning and then in the evening , we get a clicking sound , one red blink and then four blinks . Junk . Probably not worth getting fixed and a shame because the picture quality was excellent . We even had a power smoother ( ? ) from Monster .  
2	  I love how this things looks and what it does ! It 's small and compact , perfect for taking anywhere as well as for sock stuffers .  
1	  This product never worked .. period . Further , no one returned an email after I attempted to get a replacement . I am totally disappointed and felt really used .  
2	  I have owned for a short while each of the following players : MPTripD-linkClassicEach of those players skipped . I feel Expanium is the only dependable MP3-CD player in the market . The 105sec ESP really works ! I tapped the lid of the player continuously but couldn't get the player to skip . The classic which also has 105sec ESP could not withstand the continuous tapping for long . Another feature that the Expanium has that none of the other players have is the resume feature . The resume feature on the other players works only when the player is powered on . Expanium seems to remember the album ( directory ) and the track number even if the batteries are removed from the player . This is an invaluable feature to have , especially if you are dealing with over 150 tracks . In summary , I feel that though the Expanium doesn't have some of the advanced features like , ID3 tag display and text search , it is bug free and reliable . None of the other players that I have come across is entirely free of glitches .  
1	  This otherwise excellent product has one major deficiency . You can not order the tracks using the MP3 track number . You can only order tracks alphabetically , randomly , or with a playlist . I own a number of CDs such as musicals that must be played in the original track order which is part of the MP3 file tag information . Can you image watching the scenes of a DVD movie only in random or alphabetical order ? Why should I be forced to create a playlist or hack up the filename just to force this product to play the tracks in the correct order when the information necessary to do so is already in the MP3 file ? ..  
2	  All I did was plug it in , reboot my computer for good measure and it just worked . I now have 4 computers , two switches and one wireless router . I was using the wireless router to connect everything in the living room to everything in the back room ( on the switch ) , but now the two rooms are connected directly switch to switch and everything does seem faster now . I did not check timings . I purchased this because the plugs on the wireless router were loose and the cords kept coming loose every time I futz behind the computer , plus I did not have enough jacks anyway , I was always having to unplug 1 cord to plug in the BluRay player for updates . Now with 8 ports , I am good to go .  
1	  Avoid any HP discs like the plague . I bought 3 spindles of these disc thinking I was getting a good deal . I 'm not exaggerating - nearly 1/3 of the discs fail as the data approaches the outer track . There are visible flaws in the recordable media around the outside edge that indicate some kind of process flaw during the disc pressing . I 've seen several discs freshly lifted off of the spindle that have circular etching marks inside the transparent coating that follow portions of an outside track . When you try to record these - they fail precisely where these etch marks occur . I 've had similar result in ALL three of the spindles that I purchased . HP used to be synonymous with quality ; but those days are long gone . You 'll have much better results with the much cheaper and much more reliable " Amazon Basic " DVD + R and DVD-R discs . AmazonBasics 4.7 GB 16x DVD + R - 100 Pack Spindle  
2	  If you wanna get away from the iPod fad and not pay bundles of cash just because its an apple ipod then this ia a very good , reliable & compareable player . Its tiny , plays videos and does everything if not more than an ipod nano . Its definately smaller than a nano did i mention that ! All in all cheaper better and i love it ~ ~ ~ ~  
2	  Connectors snap in securely . Signal passes through despite any movement of connectors or fiber . Not much more to comment on .  
1	  The three color inks are terrible . I never be able to print out any viewable graphics .  
1	  The phone works well and good reception , but is an old model and has a few drawbacks . When on a call the phone disconnects if you want to put on the charger . Also you cant make a call while phone is on the charger . There are newer phones that have wireless headsets . I found myself ketching the cord w / something and dropping the phone . Other than those drawbacks the phone is ok for someone that does not stay on the phone all day for work , since it only has 5.5 hr talk time .  
1	  this is a sorry piece of equipment ! It jams , jams and jams again . Color reproduction is not reliable , sometimes it 's great , then not so good - same ink cartridges . Back to Epson for me !  
2	  I ordered two and one didn't work but Amazon immediately sent out the new one and it was perfect . The pictures are clear and bright and it was a big hit at Christmas . My sister received a different brand but took it back to order this one . I would highly recommend it . I would also recommend ordering through Amazon they are excellent when it comes to replacing faulty merchandise .  
1	  The camera is awesome , but this just doesn't cut it for me ! It needs to be more colorful ! Try the other colors though !  
1	  This is for one pair , although the in the product description it looks like it is for 50 pair . The spade connection is way too big to attach to home stereo equipment ( Dynaco ST70 in this case , which has pretty standard size speaker wire screw attachments ) . I 'd leave this one for the car audio folks .  
2	  Unit has very useable features and is simple to use . Tones are a little annoying , but maybe this is a good thing . Memory function and volume control are very useful . Detection seems to be good . Lot 's of false alarms due to sensitvity being so high . This is a given trade off . Voice is easy to understand . Automute is a very nice feature in congested areas .  
1	  I got 3 loose rolls of film , not as pictured in orginal Fuji wrapping . Without original wrapping I cannot tell the film 's experation date .  
1	  I had problems by order of importance to me with my first 2 because : 1 . Stylus interface to screen-req 'd excess pressure-alignment to icons inconsistent - after repeated calibration-text inconsistent , i.e. " I " comes up with " F " as worst onehappened with other letters ( both units ) 2nd unit better butstill had " I " problem though lesser extent . 2 . Monochrome screen is hard on my eyes - decided color is best . 3 . Screen size is too small . Prefer the larger though bulkierwider screen . Currently owner of a 2 meg Palm IIE . I have a basis of comparison as to sytlus pressure which is fine with this unit . The " new and improved " were polar opposite on this score .  
2	  I tend to switch between headphones and speakers on my PC quite frequently , and it was extremely annoying to reach behind the machine and have to switch plugs every time I wanted to use one or the other . This little device simplified all that and has made my life a lot easier . I just plugged both the speakers and headphones in and can toggle between the two by pressing a button . I can also toggle a mic on and off if I choose . One thing I was worried about originally was loss of sound quality when the signal passed through this device . I spent a lot of time testing out the set-up with and without the hub and cannot tell any difference . There is no loss in sound quality at all .  
1	  I bought a 512mb model u10 right after if came out and after about 8 months began to have problems with it deleting songs on its own , or when I would delete them the songs name would stay in my playlist and would stop playing whenever it came to the song . I have another u10 which is the 1GB model and after about 8 months it is doing the same thing , I wouldn't advise anyone to buy an iRiver product and if you have one take it back now because it will self destruct . IRiver isn't the only company who seems to have problems with their MP3 players lifespan , average life of a much more expensive IPod is only 18 months . Until someone steps in and insists these electronic companies make a reliable product I am sticking with the cheaper products that services like Napster and Urge offer .  
1	  I ordered this part to save time looking in the store . It came and I plugged it in . It only delivered a very static filled signal . I assumed it was a simple switch - what goes in comes out . Apparently not . I was able to buy a A / B switch that worked for less than a dollar more at Lowes . I do not recommend buying this product and I was also disappointed in the response from the seller ( return it for a refund ) .  
2	  I 'm completely satisfied with my Sangean pocket radio . Getting it at such a good price on Amazon made the purchase even more satisfying .  
1	  While its Thanksgiving morning and I have a lot to be thankful for , this Netgear switch is not one of them . Unfortuantely I have to take part of my day to return this item as its the last day I can do so . But the short story is that I got this 28 days ago and yesterday I plugged it into my clients network , right out of the box . I plug in Cisco SPA525G2 phones into ports 1,2,3,4 .. Then on port number 5 , the Cisco phone doesn't power up . So I think maybe I over subscribed the switch , but the " MAX PoE " light isn't on and each phone only draws 1.3W when not in use ! To test it out , I unplug port 5 and take the working phone in port 4 and plug it into port 5 - NOTHING ! I plug it into port 6,7,8 and still nothing . Plug it back into port 4 and it works . So its confirmed , the switch shipped with 4 bad PoE ports ! I 've always had great things to say about these Netgear switches , but for netgear to ship a switch with 50 % bad PoE ports , says a lot for their quality control ! Who 's Q / A these products before they go out ? So the customer is left to deal with it ! OK , I 'll get off my soap box . BUT apparently I " m not the first customer to have this problem . So if you order it , make sure you have plenty of time to return it and get another one to meet any kind of time-line that you may have .  
1	  I dislike netgear for several problems : 1 . It doesn't allow me to access yahoo or hotmail for weird reason . 2 . Bad customer service . 3 . Hard to configure .  
1	  Well when I first saw this item for sale , it looked like it was a nice pick . I then read the product description and then i decided to buy it . When I recieved it , i saw that the actual ear piece was like memoory foam which you press and insert into your ear so it can assume the shape and blokck out any un wanted sounds . Well it was nice at first until you wanted to PT . When you sweat , it does not stay in your ear to save the world and after prolonged use , the foam around the air piece gets old and doesn't cooperate any more and then it doesn't fit into your ear any more . On a scale of 1-10 , i give it a 3 .  
1	  This camera is a piece of junk . I have upgraded to the latest firmware ( 1.07 ) and still can't get the audio to work . You 'll be better off buying a trendnet or panasonic IP camera .  
1	  There 's no real way to tell if this thing will grab a weak signal or not . The installation directions are simple if you don't put a security lock on the device , but I 've been in situations with it when it grabs and amplifies the signal , and some when it does nothing . And I can't figure out the variables . So it 's a crap shoot .  
1	  I now have two 40Gb players and have used them alot in order to fault find my Firwire connection problem .. I have done all the A-B-C 's off fault finding including updating my software , drivers etc but all without success . Both players suffer from a firwire connection problem . Windows XP dings when the connection is made almost everytime without fail , but the software which reads the contents of the player doesn't always recognise its been connected .. very fustrating ! Apart from the fact that I can't always make a good connection between player and PC I have another similar problem . After creating some Wav files internally through its recording feature , I can't always download back to PC when connected to firwire either . I may get a lost connection error box or the transfer will stop part way through and then tell me the player is not connected .. Even though I need to overcome these faults in order to keep the unit , I do believe it 's one of the best players of it 's kind .  
2	  This piece of equipment is a piece of pleasure . Took me a total of 15 minutes to set up the router and install the card on my laptop . The 802.11g range is much more better than the 802.11b , Speed is amazing , Nice Security features . Definitely recommended A + .  
2	  The value of this camera is its size and convenience . It does not take great photos , but for the most part , outdoor pix are not too bad . I compared exact shots from my olympus 2 and 3 megapixel , and the colors from the casio were a little washed out - not true to color . Indoor shots with low light are bad , as the flash is so small it does not produce very good photos . These are the drawbacks . I got this camera to have when I don't want to carry my larger camera and to take places that I would not otherwise have taken the other . It is cool and will draw a crowd . You will need to get an additional SD card if you want to take any number of pix , but they are cheap now . Final note , the usb / charging cradle that came with it is very nice and works well - I did not install any of their software as Win XP immediatley picked up and installed the driver .  
1	  I bought this for a Canon SD10 to replace the stock battery which had a long and useful life . Right from the start the new battery didn't hold a charge anywhere near as long , and after a few charges it would only take four or five pictures before the low battery warning . I returned it for a new one and am having the same problem with it . Very disappointing . I 'm back to buy a stock Canon battery , which despite having a lower rating ( 790ah versus 1000ah ) performs much better . Beware " equivalent " batteries !  
2	  You will find my original review below . I added this 2 weeks after I purchased it and started having some seriously screwy operation with it . I had to ( out of the blue ) reset the unit to factory defaults dozens of times . My connection would keep on getting kicked and the only way to fix it was to renew my IP address . It slowed down to a crawl and my network became useless to any sane person . I got so pissed off that I got my money back on it and bought a Buffalo Nfiniti Draft-N wireless for 20 dollars more . I am ( so far ) extremely happy with that purchase . Knock on wood . I will never buy Linksys again . Too bad I can't take back my 5 stars , cause I 'd take em all back ! I purchased this because I wanted to use a VOIP broadband phone system . Didn't want to spend a lot of money or get a piece of junk so I searched for several hours to decide to get this router . I hooked it up , rebooted my cable modem , booted the router , and then rebooted the VOIP device . My phone worked immediately and my SUSE 10.2 OS continued to download files without any restart or re-logging in . Took me about 5 minutes and it works great . Although I haven't done my three XP OS 's or my Mandriva 2007 OS yet , I feel from what I have read , Windows will be a pain in the butt . I guess I will find out when I boot into them in 2-3 months . Linksys , ViaTalk , Linux . Who would of thought something would go right for a change ..  
1	  Product is very flimsy and cheaply made . Two fans work and one fan only works for a few seconds every time it 's turned on . I recommend investing in something different .  
1	  The sound was tolerable when I first started using these , but it was very muddled . AFter a few days of use they began to make this horrible crackling noise . They only lasted 2 months before the cord gave out . I would recommend the Panasonic RP-HJE200 ( now called RP-HJE240 ) . They are well worth the money because , the treble is unmatched by any headphones i 've owned , and the bass is strong , nearly overwhelming if you have the EQ set right , but it is very precise . My second pick is the JVC Marshmallows , which are still very good but they don't match the Panasonics clarity and I don't think they are as visually appealing ( yeah .. superficial , I know ) . Spend 2-3 times the amount and get a good set that will actually last . In the end the Cobys will cost you more for a lesser product .  
2	  I choose this player because of the CNET review and other sources . They were spot-on . Amazing sound quality , easy to use controls , good battery life . If you don't need huge amounts of storage , I highly recommend this player .  
1	  The GPS keeps taking me to the wrong route , despite being on the fastest time setting and even when there is barely any traffic on the freeway . Although this may be alright when you know the route but that really frustrates me . While traveling on a regular route , it directs me to take an exit which is actually the correct route but once I take that exit it starts recalculating for no apparent reason and directs me to another route then when I reset the GPS it re-directs me back to the route I was originally on taking me on and off the freeway when I can actually go straight to reach the destination . If you miss an exit , it recalculates and bring me back on the freeway and no detecting an alternative route to destination . I 'm not sure if it is just the GPS I bought was defected or it happens to all of the GPS for 360 .  
1	  This item puts out bad sound quality . In my personal auto it is so-so but in my van at work it is horrible . So forget about it .  
2	  I bought this to monitor the front yard and the circle I live on , due to vandalism concerns . I had no prior experience with network cameras prior to this one . Setup was quite easy and had to be done with a network hardline at first ( as you might have guessed ) . Within minutes I had a moving image that was viewable from a browser . To get the image , I had to allow the installation of an ActiveX control for both the motion JPEG and the MPEG-4 formats , depending on which I was trying to view from the default web page . Updating the firmware was quite simple as well . The image quality ( 640x480 ) is quite good , considering that this is a CMOS camera and that I 'm pointing it out thorough a window , and that most of my recording takes place at night ( there 's a street light in the circle ) . The software that this unit comes with is where this product falls short . Out of the box , you can either configure the camera to send you an email when it detects motion , or you can use a so-called Camera Explorer to view images and manually begin recording them . This second mode of operation stores a separate JPEG for each frame of video , so that begins taking up space at a quite rapid rate . Recording from the Camera Explorer would also spontaneously stop after 1-2 hours , even when I told it to run for 12 . I needed something better . What I found is a product on the manufacturer 's website , called Camera Station One . This is a free product that allows you to control a single camera , though a license can be purchased to allow the use and control of multiple cameras . This product does everything I wanted - I have set a schedule of when I want the recording to begin and end daily ; I 've set the format for the recording ; and I 've specified how long to retain each recording ( default is 5 days ) . There 's an option for archiving older recordings , but it 's grayed out - I assume that it becomes available upon licensing the software . Playback is simple and flexible , allowing you to search for recordings over a time frame within a single day and posting thumbnails of every 10 minutes . Playback on MJPEG recording is scaleable up to 10x normal speed . Upon pausing , the software allows you to jump back or forward by discrete time intervals , save a snapshot , send a picture to email or printer , or even convert the whole 10-minute segment of video into an AVI for playback outside of Camera Station . There are some things I 'd like to see improved though . It would have been nice to get a big notice to go check out Camera Station One , or even have that software included on the install disk . There 's no internal backup for the date / time stamp , so if you power the camera down , you have to reset the time and date ; it 's easy to do through a browser , but it 's annoying to have to do that every time . Of course , that wouldn't be as bothersome if it wasn't for the fact that the camera becomes unaccessable after a couple of days , despite sitting in the same room with the wireless router ; in those cases , I have to power cycle both the camera and the router . So I like this camera and I 'm enjoying it as a toy . I just hope it works as well when I need it for something serious .  
2	  Product came on time and is more affordable online than in stores . I love my Brother all in one printer and my Brother color printer so I will be buying ink , toner and drums online from now on !  
1	  I am very disappointed with the product manufacturing quality as well as Apple 's customer service for iPOD MINI . I purchased the MINI less than 3 months ago . Whithin three months , the central area of the LCD blacked out . When product was returned to Apple for service , Apple insisted customer cracked the LCD , and refused to service the product that carries 1 year warranty . The unit wasn't ever dropped on the floor , or compressed in unusual manner , but Apple described the issue as " abusive use " . To me , it is a toal rip-off for a product short-lived within 3 months . An expensive product with sleek look , but poor manufacturing quality . Apple 's " customer relationship " department worths visting , when you want all the BS , and excuses to shut you off . I hope there is good product out there to replace it soon .  
1	  Don't buy this or the Telephoto lens which attaches ( Olympus TCON-17F 1.7x Tele Conversion Lens for Olympus SP-310/350 Digital Cameras ) .. you will be wasting your $ on something that has very little affect overall on the enhanced telephoto abilities of a casual use camera .  
2	  I have really been enjoying the Forerunner 101 since purchasing it a few weeks ago . I love the freedom of varying my running routes without worrying about not having an exact measurement of the distance I 've run . Here are a few comments about the product : - After double-checking my routes in the car and comparing them to my Forerunner 's calculations , it seems to be pretty accurate with distance measurements . It is possible that it is sometimes off by . 10 mile or so , but that is usually close enough to satisfy me . - It can sometimes take as long as 5 minutes to initially locate the signal . This is a minor inconvenience but one I can live with . - It doesn't seem to be capable of picking up a strong signal with a lot of tree overhang . This is disappointing because I would like to use it for trail running and hiking . - The AA batteries work well as a power source . I purchased the rechargeable type of AA batteries for convenience . One should probably keep an eye on the battery life indicator on the Forerunner and go ahead and put in a fresh pair of batteries when the battery indicator gets down to one line .  
1	  I received the flash card about two weeks ago . I used it in my canon XSI , which worked as expected initially . After taking about 500 photos , I decided to copy the picture over to my desktop . I 'm not sure what happened , but when I tried to copy the photos to my computer , the files were not readable . I could only retrieved 20 pictures out of the 500 photos I took . I brought this from ChiTek , hopefully they 'll exchange for a new one . Anyhow , relability is questionable for this flash card . I never had a flash card broke on me before .  
2	  First off this compliments very very nicely with my Alpine DVA-9860 HU . I do not have an amp but have Boston Acoustics SX95 's in the rear and SX55 's in the front with stock tweeters in the front as well . The sound shines . The unit works like its supposed to . Now for the hard part . Its not easy scrolling through menus , playlists , as you have to do A LOT OF SCROLLING with the dail . If you have say 2000 songs + forget about trying to scroll by artist , song . Its impossible . What you have to do is make short playlists of your fave songs . If not , you will be frustrated with trying to get to the song you want . This is a downfall of this system . You can not control the iPod once its hooked up so that stays in the glovebox . Its a good way to listen to your iPod through your car 's audio system ( If you have an Alpine HU ) . Those FM transmitters are not for music fans . They do not sound good and have their own cons . For now , this is as good as it gets . Icelink was another product that people rave about but its almost the same thing I think .  
2	  Does all that I had hoped .. helps to declutter my vanity top and dries my hair . As for the night light .. I find that a plus .. soft glow in the whole vanity area .  
2	  I 've had this for a couple of months now and I have liked the results so far . Been doing a lot of indoor sports photography ( lacrosse and swimming ) and once I got used to the limitations of the lens ( small aperture ) I am getting very good results for a lens in this price range . Autofocus is fast and pictures are sharp . Looking forward to outdoor sports this summer !  
2	  I recently was faced with the task of either buying a new computer or rebuilding one that had bit the dust . For several reasons I chose the latter . As part of the rebuild I chose to upgrade to a dual core processor . I chose this unit for two reasons .. features and price . My original chip as a single core at 2.4G with a 512K L2 cache and rated on the cpubenchmark scale at 592 . I wanted to go to a dual core equivalent which would be a X2 4600 or 4800 , but both of these were very pricy since these are discontinued .. try around 400 bucks for a used X2 4800 . The price is because these are a socket 939 processor . Anyway , the 4400 is a 2.2G processor with dual 1M L2 caches . The price was very reasonable ( found one for 125 through Amazon marketplace ) and is now installed after receipt of a higher capacity sink / fan combo and is running great . The cpubenchmark for this chip is 1195 so I expect it to run somewhat faster , but currently I have no real demanding applications to prove such . It does appear that windows loads faster , the initial desktop screen pops into place with all icons loaded , whereas before they would load in batches . Windows defintely closes down faster . All in all , it seems to be running faster and the numbers say it is a faster chip . I am pleased with my purchase and the Amazon Marketplace vendor ( Extreme975 ) was a pleasure to work with . I would definitely use them again if the opportunity arose .  
1	  I have a Oregon Scientific 120 and a 121 model , both are lacking in headphone department . They won't stay in while swimming . I tried the Freestyle audio and their head phones get wet and stop working . The only MP3 player that works like it 's suppose to is the product by " Swimman " where they waterproof a Ipod shuffle from the inside , pared with their waterproof headphones that are like using bose ear buds under water this unit is a dream and highly recommended !  
1	  Ordered these to help with replacing the 6.5 inch speakers in my 1997 Dakota extended cab . The adapters lined up perfectly with my vehicle , but I had two brands of a standard 6.5 speaker and neither would fit in this adapter . I was only able to get them to work by using a drill and hacking something together . A 5.25 speaker looks like it would easily fit . I would not recommend these for a 6.5 speaker .  
2	  .. but has some drawbacks . One is that it 's too easy inadvertantly to open the aku cover while holding the camera for a snapshot . Photo quality is very good , can enlarge to 8 " x10 " , but not as good as the C 300 , which is no longer produced ( the C 300 is the cat 's meow ) . The successor is the C55 in Europe , the C5500 in the U.S. The 410 is smaller than the C 300 , water tight and very light , good for long distance hiking , is light because it uses an akku rather than 4 standard heavy batteries . If you 're not concerned with weight and watertightness , buy the C 55 . I find the 410 a bit too small to hold comfortably , it 's about the same size as our Olympus all weather mu-II film camera , but one has a better grip on the latter . With the Olympus quality ( I 'm told they bought Leica 's lenses ) , film is out unless you want to make slides .  
2	  I had always used HP ( with it all my HP paper ) and then after the complete disaster with my Photosmart 7660 I decided to try Epson . After looking thru several Epson printers that worked with MAC Os I found this great all in one , but then when it got home i tried printing on my infinite supply of HP Double Sided Brochure Paper but it didn't work with any of the pre-sets in the printing window . So now I have almost 50 sheets of this paper that i cannot use . Besides that is an excellent printer with excellent printing quality

1	  I am reviewing this Interfit 411 tramsmitter in the context of the price point ( around $ 35.00 ) . I was looking for an inexpensive solution to trigger two Interfit EXD 400 's without cables in a small home studio environment . After testing this product on numerous occassions , I am unsure of its value even at the low price point . Build quality : build quality is ok . Clearly not assembled or contructed with high grade materials . However , with proper handling I would expect it to last a while ( once again , considering price point ) . However , if you drop this item onto a hard floor , chances are it will shatter or at least stop working . Admittedly a bit of speculation on my part . Hot Shoe Fit : no problem mounting this item on a Nikon D300s hot shoe . Seems to be a good fit with no " wiggle . " Triggering : here is where the problems start . First off , this device does in fact trigger my EXD-400 Interfit monolights with the built in optical slave .. under ideal conditions . However , I equate its practical application as needing line of sight to all optical slaves of the monolights you wish to trigger . In other words , your positioning as a photographer to the subject is severely limited when needing to trigger the strobes . Essentially , in my two strobe setup , I need to be between and behind both lights . So , if one light is further back than the other , I must stay behind the light back the furthest . Comparatively , when using my D300s flash , I can be positioned nearly anywhere and that is with the Nikon IR flash panel ( SG-31R ) mounted . Outdoor use trials were problematic in that the transmitter only triggered the mono lights about 60 % of the time ( overcast ) . Battery use : I have not used the item long enough to provide a good opinion as to use . While I may consider another week or so trial before I decide whether to return the transmitter , I will most likely look for a wireless trigger in the comparable price range . For example , Gadget Infinity just released their new Cactus V4 wireless triggers ( 2.4ghz freq . ) . Clearly these triggers cannot compete with the venerable Pocket Wizards . However , at about $ 65.00 for a two monolight setup , it 's not far off from the INT411 . Plus the V4 's received very good reviews from semi pro 's and even some pro 's . Reported working distances in open field settings exceed 100 yards and more . Either way , IR transmission , regardless of price point , may not be the most reliable means of triggering . * UPDATE * Additional testing compels me to return this item . The range drops to 10 feet ( at best ) outside with everything perfectly lined up . Essentially , the INT 411 is only acceptable for use indoors and in a very coordinated manner in which the photographer remains stationary ( more or less ) . I decided to go with a " poverty wizard . " Specifically , after a great deal of research , I just ordered a set of Yongnuo triggers 2.4GHz ( RF-602 ) . Users are reporting range over 100 meters and through walls and trees .  
1	  The sound reproduction was actually decent , but these were hardly " Universal fit . " I have one ear slightly smaller than the other , and I thought the headband on this might help to hold the ear buds in place , but it was flimsy ( picture a pipe cleaner instead of hard plastic ) and the ear bud stubbornly refused to go into my ear .  
1	  I have to be honest that when i bought this device , i was excited having read so many great reviews . However , upon receiving it , I started using it and was very disappointed . The player is very slow connecting to your network , and then loses the connection every once in a while just for the heck of it . The user interface is somewhat confusing and is slow to respond to remote commands . Also , the little blue light on the front that indicates network transmission is a very bright blue , thats gets annoying after a few minutes . A piece of electrical tape to cover it is a must . I purchased this to take the place of my XBOX 360 's media playback functions . It was once I recieved this player that I realized just how good the XBOX 360 's media functions were . Save your money , and buy an XBOX 360 .. You wont be disappointed in the XBOX .  
1	  I bought this player for my girlfriend last Christmas . She loved it , and used it all the time . Unfortunately , over the summer the control stick stopped working . The player is one solid piece , so you can't even open it up to attempt a repair . Rio charges $ 70 for a replacement if you still have the receipt . No thanks , I 'll try another brand from now on .  
1	  I am a big fan of headphones . This pair of headphones in comparing with the Bose is too heavy and comfortable for my ears . Giving the price of the product , I guess it is ok .  
2	  I purchased this 5 disk changer when my old one went out . This one by far exceeds expectations . It will save your place on each disk . You can go back to any of them at any time . I would highly recommend this to serious movie watchers .  
2	  I bought a set for each of my children ; 2y and 5y . They are the perfect size for their little heads ; they dont ' slide off like other headsets do . They can both put them on without assistance , and they love wearing them . I love them because now I can listen to my XM in the car and not have the DVD competing behind me !  
2	  The Coby unit is an attractive , compact and easy to operate system and was just what I was looking for .  
2	  Install the driver software , plug it into the USB port . Download How hard is that ? I use it for downloading pictures . It keeps the camera free for taking pictures . What more can you say , it 's about as exciting as a floppy disk drive ! BUT , it does what it was advertised to do !  
1	  WARNING : Do not buy a new Sony Vaio of any kind with Vista if you want to record any audio off of your sound card - meaning the internet . Sony has permanently disabled the " wave " or " stereo out " abilities of they 're new computers . On all other major brands there is a simple two click solution , but Sony has deemed it in their best interests to make it impossible to reverse . This is a serious and deliberate flaw that they 've built into their computers with bigger " corporate interests " in mind , not the usefulness of their computers to the average consumer . And they 're customer service ( what a joke ) could care less ! As so many have said before me , they have the worst service - it 's just horrible . They had no idea what I was talking about and couldn't or wouldn't put me through to someone who could give me any answers . Be warned . See this forum for more information . $U$  
2	  This remote is perfect for me . The design is well thought of . It took me only a hour to program all the buttons . Pros : 1 . Inexpensive , comparing to those Harmony remotes . 2 . The macro functions that associate with those component select buttons are really wonderful . 3 . The volume control buttons send volume commands to either your receive or TV ( depending how you configure it ) no matter which component you are choosing to control . 4 . The number of buttons seem to be less than some other brand 's learning remotes . But actually they are enough . So it 's a perfect balance between functionality and complexity . 5 . Use of 2 AA batteries and prolonged battery life reduces the cost of ownership . Room for improvement : 1 . I wish it comes with customizable labels to replace some of the labels on the remote . 2 . TV / Video button could be bigger . Bottom line : This remote gives you the most bang for your buck .  
2	  It 's a great little 8-port gigabit switch ; just works . More than that - they addressed a pet peeve of mine . This switch replaces a Netgear FS605 4-port 10/100 switch that came with a big 310 gram power supply plug that ran quite warm . The giant Netgear power supply plug dissipates much more power than the switch itself . The new D-Link 's 55 gram power supply plug runs much cooler , in a much smaller package . Bravo , D-Link !  
2	  This is my second Kodak camera , my old camera had only 3x Optical Zoom , but I was looking for bigger zoom , therefore , ( .. ) The Kodak DX6490 really surprised me on many fronts , with a 4-megapixel CCD , a high-quality Schneider-Kreuznach 10x optical zoom lens with much lower than average distortion , a capable autofocus system that works down to very low light levels , and an electronic viewfinder system that likewise works very well in dim lighting . Its exposure system spans a range of control from fully automatic to fully manual , and an external flash sync connector permits use with external flash units . According to me with the four-megapixel , 10x-zoom DX6490 though , Kodak takes a large step toward bringing their excellent color technology to the " enthusiast " market . Even in light of the large lens this is a compact camera , the DX6490 has an overall body design similar to a number of other long-zoom digicams on the market , with a generous handgrip on the right-hand side , balancing the large lens on the left . It definitely won't fit into your shirt pocket , but the DX6490 is small enough for larger coat pockets , purses , backpacks , etc . , and comes with a neck strap and rechargeable batter and dock . Pro 's : - Great photo quality and excellent colors10X optical zoom lensLarge , high resolution LCDElectronic viewfinder actually useable in low lightMany manual controlsFlash sync port for external flashHybrid AF system for low light focusingVery easy to useEasyShare system makes it very easy to share and print photosNice playback and movie modes  
2	  This is a replacement of an identical item , which got broken . We were so happy with the original product , there was no consideration except a direct replacement .  
1	  I purchased the vs41 and vs55 . Vs41 more flexable but vs55 stays firm on any surface . I 've Used the Vs41 a few times and it does what its suppose to do but if you use a heavy lense the VS55 will do a job better .  
2	  The purchase was simply quick and speedy . Very satified with purchase and would buy from seller again . The wall mount is very well made and strong . All necessary equipment to apply to TV and wall were included in purchase . No need to go out and buy other equipment to attach to tv and wall . Modern mount in brand new condition . Looks are very nice . Recommended , excellent item .  
1	  I actually bought this product at a Best Buy store . I got it to my office , set it up and even programmed in my favorite radio channels . It sounded pretty good when playing the radio .. I was impressed that 8 out of my 9 favorite stations came through clearly with the antenna not even up . BUT THEN I PUT IN MY iPOD . THE HISSING SOUND IS RIDICULOUS ! If it weren't for the fact that I must now go through the pain of repackaging it and taking it right back to the store , I might even say it 's laughable how bad the hissing is . If you turn the volume up past , say 12 , the hissing is mostly drowned out by the music , but on any setting below that your high tech iPod sounds like an old record played through blown out speakers . Also , I couldn't get my iPod Mini onto the docking fitting with the included adjuster for the mini in . I had to plug in the iPod , then slide the iLive 's fitting down around it . Weird . Additionally annoying : Every time you power the unit on the volume is preset to 17 .. way too loud for my office environment ! Arrgg ! If you 've been looking for one of these things for longer than 2 minutes you know how next to impossible it is to find one WITH a CD player built in , but PLEASE BE FORWARNED ! DO NOT BUY THIS ONE ! Check out the Emerson IP600BK , also with CD . The sound quality was startling good when I tried it out in a store . Unfortunately , I had reward points for Best Buy which I wanted to use on this purchase and they don't carry the Emerson . :( However , for the quality I think I 'll buy the Emerson out of pocket here at Amazon .  
2	  I use this keyboard every day . It works great on my iPAQ 3600 and recommend it to anyone that has one of these PDAs . Much easier than poking with a stylus .  
2	  While not the top of the line , it more than does the job for a reasonably priced flat panel monitor . Crisp definition - easy plug and play set up - no problems whatsoever with Windows XP compatibility . Don't be fooled into thinking you have to pay more for the convenience of a flat panel . We 've had it since Christmas of 2001 & use it for surfing , game playing , photo editing , & word processing , and we 've been pleased on all counts . - 1 caveat : we had to download the user manual from Envision 's site .  
2	  I 've had this camera for about 3 years now and it finally broke . Let me tell you though I really got my money 's worth . Between my wife , our two young ( read " not particularly careful " ) children and I , we 've probably taken thousands of pictures and video clips using this camera . When I ordered it I was looking for an underwater digital camera to take to the beach and the pool and this was one of only two that I could find at the time . I don't even remember what brand the other camera was but who cares ? This one was perfect for my needs . Now I 'm no photography expert . I just wanted a point-and-shoot camera that took great pictures and video clips , and that 's exactly what I got . Takes really nice , clean pictures and video clips ( with sound ) and transferring them to either iPhoto on my MAC or the documents folder on my PC is a breeze . I didn't even need to install any software to do it . After years of sea and pool water shots and a couple of falls the camera has finally started to act up , ( refusing to start up sometimes ) but we got 3 years of trouble-free service out of it even with the torture we put it through and to expect it to last forever would just be ridiculous . I 'm very pleased with my purchase and if I can't get it fixed I 'm gonna just buy the newer model . The people at Olympus have themselves a loyal customer here .  
1	  The price was great and that is exactly why I bought it . But , I got just what I paid for ! It worked great for the first 2 weeks and then it was downhill from there . The volume turns down on it 's own ! I would lose all of the music on the player for no reason and finally the thing just died after about a month . The company was great and gave me a new player to replace the original piece of crap I bought . They didn't give me a hard time or didn't question me at all . I was very pleased with that . I still have the replacement and it 's been at least a year . It works good except for I don't get sound into both ear pieces of my headphones unless I push the headphone slot to the side and it works . Anyways , this product is not worth the money . spend a little more money and get a good product .  
2	  So I have to admit when I ordered these after a week of sifting through tons of reviews , I was expecting an amazing pair of earbuds with some serious bass and a great sound . I already have a nice pair of Sennheiser CX-300 and Skull Candy Smokin Buds , and both have there pros and cons , but both sound very good . So after reading all the reviews about how these are SO amazing and have the most amazing bass , I was expecting something pretty special . So am I blown away .. in one word .. NO . They are nice , they have good bass response , maybe a little better than most other earbuds , they have a pretty good sound in the rest of the frequency range , but a tad muffled . The one thing I like about these is that if you use the right silicon ear piece , they fit great in your ear and will not fall out or wiggle themselves loose as easy other styles ( ie the Skullcandy Smokin Buds ) . So overall , they are pretty good , and will be fine for the gym , but they aren't as amazing as some people are saying they are . Of course I wasn't expecting an epiphany after listening to these , but I was expecting something amazing , and these are not amazing .. there just good . Pros : - Very good bass response-Good overall sound-Fit in the ear is great-Doesn't have one of those annoying little volume sliders right at chest level to get in your way while working outCons : - Bass not as great as company and lots of reviews hype them up to be-Even though they have a good overall sound , it 's a tad muffled , better for rock , metal , rap , electronic , not jazz , classical , or more intricate music-Doesn't have the little plastic slider that can pull the cord together up under your chin  
1	  Bought these 3 months ago . I listen to them pretty loud ( Katy Perry and such ) . Only 1 speaker works now , not good quality . I smelled electric smoke a few weeks ago and they have always had static in them . Not a good speaker .  
2	  First of all , this is almost 1/2 the cost at Walmart . My biggest complaint about this DVD player is that it takes forever to boot up . When you want to put a DVD in , you have to wait for it to boot up before you can even eject the old DVD . Otherwise , it 's fairly decent .  
2	  I LOVE the camera as if it was my sister , or something loveable . I will NEVER sell this camera , not for all of the money in the world . This has a microphone that can record your breath . I would recomend this to any TV station that likes HD ( high defonition ) . I myself joined a TV station and they have the SAME camera . It shows a good picture , and is kind of light . Please get this camera before they are extinct . BEWARE PRICE !  
1	  I won this in a drawing so for something free , I can't complain too much . However after maybe 2-3 uses , it no longer plays even after charging . The play button seems to have been pushed in and no longer clicks . This may be a reason why I can't get it playing . I won't get a replacement .  
1	  I thought this would eliminate the 5 remotes littering my family room , but only managed to replace one , leaving me with still 5 remotes . The harmony doesn't work with the Sony PS3 because it lacks blue tooth . You can buy a USB IR receiver to stick out of the front of the PS3 , but you 'd still have to get up and power it on . The harmony doesn't work at all with the Nintendo Wii . It claims to work with the original xbox if you have the IR dongle plugged in , but again , you have to get up and turn the unit on . However , it wouldn't work on my xbox running XBMC ( it may have if I had the time and patience to play with it ) . It would sort of work with my dish network HD DVR . It could power it on and change the channel / volume stuff , but had no buttons to control any DVR functions . The only device the harmony played well with was my Pioneer receiver and Sharp Aquos LCD . I could have used my receiver 's remote to control these things . The remotes LCD display turns on whenever you move the remote , which is somewhat annoying at times . The display also is of low quality and doesn't look like it has the ability to make you own icons , only the generic ones , therefore if you have two game systems , they 'd both be called " Play Game " , which isn't very helpful . Very disappointed in this product considering all it 's hype .  
1	  THIS ITEM WAS DELAYED IN SHIPPING AND WHEN IT FINALLY ARRIVED THE BOX HAD CORRECT PART NUMBER ON IT , YET , ACTUAL PART ENCLOSED HAD A DIFFERENT PART # / WAS NOT THE ITEM WE ORDERED , THUS , NOT COMPATIBLE W / OUR MODEL CAMERA . SO WE CANNOT REVIEW OR RATE .  
1	  I just purchased this camera and was thrilled with the ease of use . It is definitly a winner . BUT - be prepared for the software ! A camera dock was included with the camera and I did not want to purchase the printer dock as I am very happy with the results I get with my own printer . I enjoy being able to manipulate my pictures for collage , calendars , cards , etc . The Kodak software allows you to connect directly to your computer with a provided USB cable or the dock . The download was successful and then came the problems . You cannot copy the pictures to any other program which I wanted to do as their software editing of pictures is limited to redeye , brightness and crop . If you use the crop feature , when you print it won't make any difference as the sizes are 4x6 , 8x10 , etc . The only way I could get a picture I could copy was to burn a CD or print the picture and scan it . When you print , you have to use Kodak paper or you cannot use their one button feature which is an autofix of your picture . It seems the salespitch here is to force you into buying their printer and then doing what you want with a scanner or CD to get the results you want . If you don't , you will be wasting a lot of picture quality paper . If you just want a good camera and are willing to invest in their printer , paper and ink , then you will probably like this camera . As for me , I am returning it for a refund .  
1	  When they were new , sound quality was decent , as was range , but then the batteries get used up quickly and the SQ goes down with it . you can use the included adapter , but that defeats the wireless point . remote cant turn them on , and volume adjustment is independent of each speaker ( not in stereo ) today , one of the speakers just died ! good esthetic design thoughupdate 12/14/08Amazon and Cables unlimited have been great about exchanging the defective speakers , even though it was right at the warranty end ( 1yr ) . i noticed the replacements say cables unlimited on them instead of velocity wireless , they look the same , but seem to sound a lot better , than the original . for that , i would upgrade to maybe 3.5 stars , and even 4 if these last longer than the originals ( call me in a year ) :)  
2	  After the crash of my computer 's hard drive , I was encouraged by my tech to purchase an external hard drive to back up my files . After reviewing several drives , I chose this one . It works great . Easy to install and up and running in no time . Takes up almost no space on my desk and the lightbar in front lets me know it is always available . My computer holds hundreds of photos that I would hate to lose so this drive gives me another level of security . P.S. the tech was able to salvage all but one corrupted file . Lucky me .  
1	  If you are looking for an IPod alarm system this is your machine . The reviewer comments about good sound quality are on the mark . But it has one serious design flaw at least for how I wanted to use it and I 'm returning mine . I thought it was a dual IPod / Radio alarm system , as advertised . It is not . The radio alarm is only a second alarm , apparently for a second sleeper . You cannot select between the two options . Tried the work around of setting the second alarm to go off first but you can't not set Ipod alarm so when it ( or the buzzer ) goes off it shuts down the radio . Can't understand why they couldn't have worked around this issue but beware if you want choice and flexibility in what you wake to .  
2	  I 've had my set for about two weeks . It replaced a 5 year old Toshiba rear projection HDTV.I watch Time Warner Cable , HD DVDs ( Toshiba HD A2 ) and Blue Ray HD DVDs ( SONY PS3 ) . I have been pleased with the picture quality of HD material on all three mediums . I find the standard definition Cable picture quality inferior to the quality of standard definition on our standard defiinition ( 480i ) TVs . Upconverting standard DVDs works well and produces a fine picture on the WD-57831 . My one complaint so far concerns the WD-57831 cooling fan . Its quite noisy . Otherwise I love the set and the price was right = $ 2400 including shipping .  
2	  I received this subwoofer as a Christmas gift ( 2011 ) . I recently put together a home theater in my basement with 7.1 sound , but due to budget constraints I was using an old subwoofer ( about 15 years old ) from a Home Theater in a box setup I had . I subwoofer was seriously underpowered and was barely noticeable . When I originally researched the components for my new setup I found this subwoofer and liked it because of its size and power to price ratio . I didn't expect anyone else to buy the unit for me , so when I opened the box on Christmas it was a complete surprise . Since all my research had been online only , I didn't know what it was at first because it was bigger and heavier than I had imagined . I hooked it up to my receiver ( Pioneer 1021K ) and was blown away . My first test was playing the blu-ray The Dark Knight . The windows were rattling and the couch was actually vibrating too . I turned down the power level to about 20 % ( and adjusted down the subwoofer output level on my receiver ) and found it to still be great sound and not quite so intense ( made the wife happy ) . I thought my home theater setup was good before , but this unit now makes it great . Totally recommend with no reservations .  
2	  I purshased these portable speakers a few months ago at a local retail store . I must say that I 'm quite pleased . I have used them almost everyday since purchasing them with no major problems . I listen to rock / alternative music and audiobooks on these . When on battery mode , there is often a bassy low thump-like sound when initially turned on . I 've read other complaints about this and the solution is to hold the volume up button for a few seconds and it 'll stop . The sound quality is very decent for speakers of this size and price . You 're not going to get stereo sound due to no subwoofer , but the portability factor makes up for it . These speakers , in my opinion , are for someone who is on a budget , wants decent sound , and a compact design . If you want better sound , maybe go with the JBL On Tour speakers or the On Stage speakers . For the casual listener , these are fine ! By the way , DO NOT BLAST THESE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BREAK THEM ! Keep this system at a moderate level . Happy listening !  
1	  is too small for canon a620 , about 1 cm of the body of the camera stays outside of the case . So , save your money , buy another a little bigger . Nice quality , useless .  
1	  words cannot express my hatred for the samsung helix . here 's why .. i received it in febuary . i had it on my desk at work hooked into it 's little home cradle and antenna getup ( which in itself is a pain to deal with ) it worked for 6 hours then said " no signal . " it never got a signal back so i called xm . they said it was samsung so i called them . long story short .. it 's been in for repair 3 times now and it 's may . first it came back saying they replaced the antenna and a board . still said " no signal . " so i sent it back . it came back saying that " it worked fine in New Jersey . " i live in a large city and tried in KC even . still , no signal . so i sent it back . this time it came back saying it was dead and completely inoperable and they had to replace electrical parts . i turned it on and it worked . so i called xm and had them resend the signal . helix never got the signal so i called xm . they had me look at the actual radio to get the id number . samsung had sent me a refurbished radio but neglected to tell me that . this is the important part though samsung " customer service " is HORRIBLE . i will never ever buy anything from them again . i 've spent countless hours on hold for nothing basically . once i was cut off 4 times in the half hour i was on the phone with them . they denied cutting me off saying that i must have hung up on them ! this thing is a piece of junk and is anything but portable . as long as you 're standing perfectly still with its worthless little antenna pointed directly at the sky then it works decent . if you want xm , get an internet account . xm gave me 2 months free service for my " problems . " after that i am giving up un Helix and only using xm online . Helix will make an adorable doorstop though .. i wish someone would have told me this before i got it . i cannot believe that some people have paid 300 bucks for this thing .  
2	  These small headphones have a great sound . Plenty of solid deep bass and clear highs . You would think you were wear a pair of over the ear headphones .  
2	  I own a dj 15gb which I had now for approximately three years . I love it . I read the reviews that the player will not support playforsure audio . This is totally incorrect . I download music from Walmart and all their music is in the playforsure format . I never had a problem using MusicMatch to download audio onto my dj . The dj controls are easy to navigate . My only compliant is that there is no review button . The sound is superb , I suggest you purchase KOSS Stereo In Ear Ear Plugs . I previously owned a RCA Lyra which had a FM transmitter . It was a waste of money , because I never listened to FM . What is the purpose of a FM transmitter when you have your own music to listen to ? I would never consider owning an ipod , for all my downloaded music is in the playforsure format , which ipod definitely does not support . Sony ipod is a rip off , because it does not allow you to use any other format , except itunes . An ipod is NOT the best or economically audio player . It is only a popular audio player .  
2	  The Linksys WRT54GL router is a very capable router out of the box . I cannot attest to Linksys Firmwares operation or stability . I can , however , confidently state that this router , coupled with the Tomato Firmware is by far the best SOHO router I have ever worked with . I received the Version 1.1 of this router and loaded it with Tomato immediately . Be aware that doing this most assuredly voids your warranty , but it is well worth it . I am running Tomato 1.19 but he is up to version 1.20 though as of this writing . I have experience with numerous routers from several manufacturers . Nothing compares to the Linksys WRT54GL and Tomato .  
1	  I have taken apart iPods before and successfully replaced their batteries , so I am not a newbie . With a device as small as the iPod Mini , a difference of 1/16 " of an inch can make a difference . I was trying to fit the new battery into place on my iPod . But it was slightly too wide . While applying a little too much force to seat it , I broke off the headphone jack assembly ( daughter card ) off of the motherboard . Now my whole iPod is ruined . After peeling off the protective plastic from both batteries and closely comparing with the original Apple battery , it seems the place where the wires go into the new one make the battery TOO WIDE . It will not fit into the space given on the iPod . Before writing this , I did one more test to confirm that the old battery fits as it should , and the new one does not . I am correct - the old battery fits fine . The new one will NOT fit without jamming it too hard . This is a big disappointment and a waste of money .  
1	  Neither of the items I received were Sony products although they are described as such ( even with the Sony part numbers ) . This must explain why it is ~ $ 20 cheaper than if you buy the real thing . The battery I received was not marked Sony . It was labeled with a part number for an equivalent battery from another manufacturer ( BP-BG1 , Mfg : Digital Concepts ) . The battery was loosely packed ( with no case of its own ) in the " leather " case . As for the " leather " case , it had Sony packaging ( nothing like what you 'll see in the store ) and some paperwork , but the case itself is clearly NOT GENUINE LEATHER ! The ends are not folded over when stitched making it a dead giveaway as plastic on close inspection . I actually ordered the real thing from Sony-Style with the Info-Lithium version of the battery ( all they have in stock ) and had it in hand with the version from Buy Accessories . The differences are obvious from the packaging to the product - anyone could tell this is not a Sony product . I feel bad for those other reviewers who mention the case does not seem like real leather yet believe it is a Sony product . I can not say for certain that every camera kit Buy Accessories delivered is not made by Sony but what I received was CERTAINLY NOT SONY ! I hope this review results in at least buyer awareness and at most the seller removing this item or delivering the real thing . I gave this item / seller one star because they did end up giving a full refund - Thanks , Buy Accessories . However , this was after they tried to send me a " real " Sony battery and let me keep everything else .  
1	  I didn't actually buy this device , but I suggested it to a friend who did . He was very impressed by my IRiver U10 ( now Clix ) because of the Flash Games . Come to find out the device will only play the two games that come with the device . The flash files are part of the firmware and thus are not visible or removeable , and even more important , you CAN NOT add new games or programs . This is a shame because there are a growing number wonderful flash games and applications available . This was confirmed on the Adobe site , but is mentioned nowhere on the Samsung site or manual . If you want this MP3 player , buy it . It 's really pretty and seems totally awesome other than this major oversight on Samsung 's part . Hopefully Samsung will get it right and release a new firmware version that supplies the functionality advertised . For now my buddy will return his and I won't recommend it .  
2	  I kept blowing the amp in my Infinity sub so decided to replace it instead of having it repaired again . The Polk sub has a larger amp and produces much more deeper , tighter bass than my Infinity or my Advent subs combined . I am a new Polk fan and am thrilled with the quality of product for the price paid . You just can't go wrong with this level of quality . Using this with my Polk tower speakers makes a complete soundstage for movies that I just didn't have with the old system . I am thrilled with Polk quality and the ease of purchasing from aAmazon .  
2	  This product was suggested as one of the best to purchase to replace my old one . I 've connected it and so far it works perfectly . My friend is sort of a geek and knows his stuff so I 'm glad he was there to help me select this particular USB 2.0 7-port Hub . J. Bossard / San Francisco  
2	  I cannot really deduct a star for my wanting too much or not fully realizing what I was buying , however it is much taller ( roughly 15 inches ) than I anticipated and the neck is much narrower ( 1.25 " at its narrowest ) so one needs an uncommonly long bottle brush to clean it and it will be a bit harder to get ice into it than I would like ( think ice clumped together in a bag purchased while traveling ) . I did not get the 48oz wide mouth versionThermos Nissan 48-Ounce Wide Mouth Stainless-Steel Bottlebecause the top seemed to be a pain to clean and prone to failure . I did not get theZojirushi Premium Thermal 1.85 liter Carafe , Brushed Stainless Steelbecause , knowing me , I 'd just break the glass . It does perform its job very well . It keeps a batch of coffee hot all day long with little worry about it spilling if you keep it on its side in the car and it pours very well . There are carve outs for the liquid and replacement air on two sides of the screw in top ( the arrows on top point them out ) , so when you loosen the top 2 turns , the coffee pours out without any mess at all .  
1	  LOL .. there has to be a mistake with the pricing here ! These heatsinks sell for ~ $ 25.00 new .. I knew the price of copper was on the rise but ..  
2	  The product was delivered as promised and works well with our Bogan tripod . The quick release product fit my Nikon D200 well .  
2	  Regular SD CARD , I use it for my Canon digital camera , writing speed is good . No complaints . Recommend it for point and shoot cameras . Pretty cheap it 's $ 60 in retail .  
1	  This battery is an exact replacement for my Panasonic phone . I was very disappointed to see that Amazon ( not a reseller ) sent a battery with packaging already neatly sliced open . The battery came right out . So far the battery works fine but I don't know how long it will last or its prior history . It 's not worth the effort and expense to send it back so I 'll live with it , but not pleased with the experience .  
2	  I bought this camera because it is an affordable medium format camera and I didn't have $ 5k to spend on a nicer one . Anyway , I love it . I developed my first few rolls of film and discovered that I needed to learn the settings and how to adjust the focus , but other than my mistakes , the camera is great . It takes great photos and it looks super cool . :) I love it .  
2	  This item had a good price and was very easy to install . So far I have had no problems .  
1	  I purchased the Viking 1GB CompactFlash card when I purchased the Canon 20D . I had only taken around 100 pictures when I began to get the " Data corrupt " error . My mistake was that I gave it several more chances . I formatted it several times and I continue to get the same error , not to mention I lost some pictures I had taken earlier which cannot be replicated . It 's not worth the money nor the headache . It 's better to spend an extra $ 30 on a better quality CompactFlash card than to have wonder whether you 'll lose the pictures you just took .  
2	  I got my iPod nano soon after I saw how beautiful and tiny it was at an Apple store . After 4 months of almost every day use , I found it a delightful , fun , easy-to-use device , with some flaws . 1 . It is ultra ultra small . So keep it connected to a ear bud , or risk losing it . 2 . On a 4G nano , I store 500-600 songs at 192 kbps , or you can store 1000 songs at 128 kbps . 3 . I have a white nano , and its small color screen scratches ( too ) easily . So , I never carry a nano in my jean pocket . 4 . Contacts information can be stored and viewed on a nano . But remember it is not a PDA , where information can be edited . 5 . Local time , one per city , can be viewed on a nano , but this is often annoyingly off by one hour . 6 . I lost my iTunes database , due to a computer harddisk failure . I tried many different things , all unsuccessful , to restore the iTunes database from the iPod nano . So , back up your iTunes database regularly , as a nano cannot serve as a backup device . 7 . Playing . mp3 music using Windows Media Player sounds much better than Apple 's iTunes player . So , I maintain two music databases , one for Windows and one for iPod , and turn off sync'ing to Windows player . Highly recommended . Be advised , and enjoy !  
1	  I received tv for a great price from Amazon and had no trouble with the shipping . TV picture quality was awesome , immediately loved the tv . Had tv for approximately a week and then on vacation for two weeks . Came back and watched off and on for another couple of weeks , then picture went real white . Called Amazon but it was past thirty day return policy . Called Samsung and got the run around for a week and a half about getting it repaired . The first place they told us to call to get it fixed the guy just laughed and said he didn't want to touch it . Finally , found a local repair shop and the guy there said he had never heard of a problem like the one we are experiencing . Been with out tv for going on three weeks . Not sure about quality or quality of service .  
2	  Received my Terastation a little over a week ago and had it set up and running in less than a half an hour . The server connection to my ethernet was automatic with absolutely no problem . Software installation took no more than 5 minutes and was very intuitive . Changed from RAID5 ( default ) to RAID1 in less than ten minutes . Access over a 100MB ethernet is as fast as my internal drive . Documentation on CD is complete . System is connected to 3 computers , 2 of which are wireless , all with sterling performance . I wish all my computer add-on purchases were as advertised like this machine is , and so easy to install .  
2	  I am usually nervous about buying off-brand / refurbished items , but the price on this product was too good to pass up since I could buy 3 of them for the price of one HP cartridge . When it arrived , there weren't instructions , so I inserted the cartridge into my printer and tried a few test pages and was very disappointed with the results . However , after pulling the cartridge out and inspecting it , I discovered I had failed to remove a strip of plastic that was preventing the cartridge from operating properly . With the strip of plastic removed and the cartridge back in the printer , printed test pages had the expected quality . Had the packaging included something to indicate the removal of the plastic strip was necessary , I would have given this product a 5 star .  
2	  One week after I bought the IIc it became the most useful and enjoyable gadget in my possession . I have no complain about the IIc , it has a good speaker , a robust battery , an amazing display and I have never topped the memory , even when I have plenty of stuff in it . It is easy to carry but not excessively light like the Vx that would easily jump out of your pocket .  
1	  HELLO BOUGHT THIS INVERTER SPECIFICALLY TO POWER THE 180 WATT BATTERY CHARGER THAT I USE TO POWER UP THE BATTERIES ON MY ELECTRIC MOTORCYCLE . VERY DISAPPOINTING . IT IS A 900 WATT UNIT AND WHILE IT WOULD POWER OTHER 110 VOLT APPLIANCES , IT WOULD NOT RUN THE MUCH SMALLER DRAW THAT IS REQUIRED FOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED CHARGER . ONCE THE CHARGER WAS PLUGGED INTO THIS INVERTER , THIS INVERTER WOULD START BEEPING EVERY ATTEMPT . FUTHER , I EMAILED THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THIS UNIT 2 WEEKS AGO AND I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THEM.I BUILT MY OWM SOLAR PANELS , AND THEY WORK FINE . I PUT TOGETHER SOME 12 VOLT BATTERIES POSITIVE POSITIVE TO POSITIVE ETC . MY GOAL WAS TO HAVE ONE SOLAR POWERED RIDE ON MY MOTORCYCLE THIS FALL BEFORE IT WAS TIME TO PUT IT AWAY . THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.I DID MY PART , BUT WAS LET DOWN BY THIS PRODUCT . END OF REVIEWRodney7777  
2	  I use this cable with my Nikon D40x . It comes in handy when we are travelling and want to have a quick slide show on a bigger screen . Output can be in PAL or NTSC . Its great to have in your camera bag . I believe the cable comes with the D80 and above . If you don't have one , its wise to get it .  
1	  I bought this keyboard because of the split design ( better wrist angle ) , but the keys feel loose and a bit sluggish . They also have a surprising amount of resistance so that my hands get tired after a very short time and the space bar tends to stick in the " on " ( down ) position . The keys are also kind of large so I find myself reaching for the backspace key . For $ 80 , I expected better quality and ergonomics from Logitech . I really feel like , with more work , they could have a fantastic product . If they added a touchpad to the keyboard , it would be even better .

1	  .. but in this case an inferior product . There are better ones out there with more functionality and better quality .  
2	  The Sony PS LX350H is a good entry point into the " retro " world of good sounding vinyl if you 're tired of somewhat " mechanical " and less than " open " sounding CD 's and other digital formats . This turntable is TOTALLY manual ! Cool if you don't mind " tweaking " the ' table every so often . The unit itself is pretty heavy-about 15 pounds-and very solid-what you want for full sounding analog . The pitch control works great once you get the motor adjusted-overlooked in the so called owner 's manual . The 33 and 45 motor speed adjustments are on the bottom . The supplied cartridge sounds pretty good-again once you properly align it-another point omitted in the " manual . " If you overlook the sparse info in the manual and take your time setting it up you 'll be rewarded with a surprisingly good sounding system ! If you can get this ' table on sale you won't be disappointed . Don't forget it 's not and doesn't pretend to be the equivalent of a Thorens , Music Hall , Rega or other high end unit . The bottom line is this table is a GOOD SOUNDING GOOD DEAL !  
2	  This is a pretty nice product . It does feel a little bit flimsy , but it only enhances its portability . I use it mostly to prop my computer up on my desk and it works really well for that , it grips the bottom of the machine really well . The only thing is the metal bit that turns it from a lap desk to a computer stand is kind of crappy and mine kept falling out .  
2	  Kodak EasyShare Z712 IS 7.1MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized ZoomI have been very happy with the results from this camera . It is easy to use and has many manual features that are very good .  
2	  Just the size of this USB drive is enough to give it 5 stars . I know there are smaller ones out there , but this one is only a tad larger and much more securely built . I 've owned a few lexar and SanDisk USB drives , and all of their USB plugs get loose within a month of use . I loved the oversized covering for the drive that covered the whole unit-not just the usb plug . However , I don't think it is offered any more since they have moved to rubber skins for the new models . This is probably for the best since those old plastic protectors would get worn down from use and fall off the drive in transport . As for speed , this thing is definetly USB 2.0 and fast . If you 've used a USB 1x drive , you 'll notice a huge difference . I have seen some USB drives that perform faster ( the Corsair models ) but this one is still fast enough . Highly recommended , especially if you can score the rebates . Mine came in almost exactly 6 weeks after purchase .  
2	  The Pentax K 10d is the winner in DSLR cameras aimed for amateur photographers looking for quality equipment at less than $ 1000 . Pentax has hit the sweet spot with the K10d offering features found in cameras costing more than $ 1000 . Since I have a Nikon N80 , it 's the film version of the D80 , I seriously considered the D80 . But even with my Nikon lenses I still saved over $ 200 with the Pentax plus I don't have to spend extra for the Nikon imaging program for RAW files . The D80 doesn't have a sensor cleaner or shake reduction built into the camera body . I have been using the Pentax for about a month and find that it 's a photographers camera . Controls that you use for taking pictures are dials on the camera body not menus . You can look through the viewfinder to make changes and not have to stop and scroll through a menu found on other brands . I would also recommend buying the Pentax AF360 or 540 flash . The competition among camera companies is fierce and the consumer is in the drivers seat . You really can't go wrong with any DSLR . I looked at other brands besides Nikon . Cannon and Sony make great cameras but you really have to put the camera in your hand , take pictures and see which camera is comfortable for you . It should be an extension of your eye and you should be able to work the controls intutively .  
2	  Switched from Windows to Linux and dumped my Pocket PC PDA for this . Does everything I need it to and the battery life is great  
1	  I ordered this pair of headphones with microphone so I could talk to my teammates while playing multiplayer games online while using the Roger Wilco software . The set works alright for this purpose . The microphone picks up my voice fairly well . However , attaching the mic to the headset was somewhat difficult , and I thought I would break it in the process ( very tight fit & cheap plastic . ) As for the sound quality , it is adaquate for online gaming , however , they they don't put out very much bass at all . A cheap $ .. pair of headphones can be purchased at any electronics store which will produce a bit better sound quality ( but no microphone . )  
1	  Extremely disappointed with the player sound quality , headphones , customer support and worst of all , it doesn't play MP3 CDs burned on Windows XP . You 'll know if you have the MP3 problem when Mojo skips every 25 seconds of a track . Hence , 25 seconds into a song , you 'll hear an audible click . Every 25 seconds later , you 'll hear the same click . It gets very annoying and I don't use the player anymore . I have other better quality and cheaper CD players around the house . I bought Mojo because it was supposed to play MP3 CDs . With regards to the MP3 issue , if you check their web site , they admit as much . It suggest that you use a 3rd party software to burn the CDs and not use XP 's Windows Media Player to burn it . I used Easy CD Creator 's software ( which is one of the most popular burning apps ) to create my MP3 CDs and it still doesn't work . I also had an older MP3 CD burned on Windows NT which also does not play on Mojo . Hence , all I have now is a poor sound quality and overpriced CD player . TDK customer support and website did not offer any other help on the MP3 issue . I e-mailed TDK twice about the problems but each time , I got a typical set answer which I already knew . It is as if customer support doesn't read the e-mails . I suppose a PC reads your e-mails and scans it for certain phrases like " XP " , admits they know about the problem and blames it on Microsoft . Until Microsoft fixes it , it 's your problem . I bought this Mojo on the Internet and was supposed to receive rebate which never arrived . It highlights one of the problems of buying online ; other than reviews online ( which I read and most must have been written by TDK employees ) , you 'll be left with taking a chance on the product if you don't try it at a store first . Note : However , Amazon . com is great for CDs and books ! : ) In conclusion , with Windows XP soon to be the predominant OS in most homes , it is absolutely unforgiveable that TDK Mojo does not play MP3s burned on Win XP . Save yourself the hassle of burning CDs and get a hard-drive based MP3 jukebox player like the iPod or the Nomad . I 'll also never buy anything from TDK again as their customer support is useless when there 's a problem with their product .  
2	  If you 're looking for an inexpensive recorder with basic control this will fit your needs .  
1	  the ipod i bought literally doesnt work . if you press skip it continues to shuffle non stop . Very dissatsified with this " refurbished " product . Will not buy another refurbushid product  
2	  We did a lot of research and saw what sales were running after Thanksgiving before deciding on this one . For the price , the little bit of extra money to get a Sony was worth it . It was super easy to set up and the HD channels are incredibly vibrant and sharp . The only complaints I have is the picture for regular cable channels is very fuzzy , and the sound quality is not nearly as good as my LCD Samsung TV . It 's very hard to hear the dialogue even though I customized the sound to help this is as much as possible . I am going to hook it upto a Sony Bravia compatible home theatre system and see if that helps . Highly recommend otherwise , and am still glad I bought it .  
1	  I 've owned a DVD S2500 since July . Sometime within the last two months the audio and video on commercial DVDs have gone out of sync . This is most noticeble at the start of a disk , but seems to improve later . I don't think that this happened when the player was brand new . I use the HDMI output to a Denon receiver . Looks like I will have to return the player for factory service . I 'd be interested to know if anyone else has experienced this problem .  
1	  The cable did not work with my Garmin NuVi 255w . Not happy with it . I will go directly to Garmin to get a new cable .  
1	  The HDMI cable was of poor quality as both ends of the cable were w / the connectors loose and not soldered properly . This caused much aggravation because it took me quite a while to figure out that the brand new cable was inferior and causing the problem . Now , I 've missed the holiday season watching movies without HD on the new Network Media Player our family got for streaming movies . I will try to contact the supplier to see if they will stand behind their product .  
1	  While the size , shape , and function of this remote is nice I have to say that it is best to stay away from it . HK has horrible support and has taken the programming software off their website and now charges for it ( $ 10 ) . Seeing how Logitech makes frequent and free updates to their software , I feel this is outrageous and warrants a poor rating . Long term you do not get the same programming and software updates as do the Harmonies . You are always behind in firmware and software and now you have to pay to upgrade . Customer Service at HK is a nightmare I had to redial a long distance number ( no 800 # ) for 30 minutes to get past constant busy signals . Once there I had to wait 40 minutes to talk to someone that just passed me to a different dept . which then passed me right back and so on and so forth until a bad transfer disconnected me . Do yourself a favor , get a different remote because if you ever have a problem HK does not stand behind their products without a fight and a charge .  
2	  I wasn't sure what to expect - but I love my device . My husand has an iPod and I 've tried it a bit , so I 've used both similarly and with no prior experience in either . BTW brown is the new black ! Okay , just had to add that . :-) Wasn't sure I would like it but it 's very unique and fun . What 's different : The Zune has an up / down / side interface vs . the circle . I personally prefer it because with the circle , I always ended up 5 songs past where I wanted to be . But others like the speed of the circle , so this is a personal thing . What 's cool : Great screen - at least 15 + people have commented on how nice it is . You can set backgrounds with any pictures , it 's really easy and looks great . You have album art and you can send photos to another Zune very easily . You can share music with other Zune owners - I don't mind the 3-day / 3-listen limit . It gives you a reasonable chance of enjoying the music and the option to go buy it ( support your artists ! ) :-) The relocate feature lets you connect as a Guest to other machines easily . I found the battery life to be good tho haven't compared it to other devices . Sounds really sweet with high quality rips from my CDs . All in all I 'm glad I made the purchase and while there are a few things to figure out , I really like the device . I think its pretty easy to use , makes sharing photos and music really simple , and offers a significant feature set for a music player of its price . PS : I don't hit the same issues with my software , but I empathize with other folks and hope these issues get fixed soon . The up side here is that these types of bugs can be resolved with software updates .  
2	  I bought this scanner in December 2000 , so almost 10 years ago ! It is flat and USB powered , so means you can take it with your laptop on the go . It is fast enough and quality is good enough too . Once you know on OS / X you have to install VueScan , this is just great ! 10 years old and still running great : maybe my best value for money in my computer life ! ( I 'm pretty sure I have no other ICT product left from 2000 )  
2	  I 've been working with this mouse for a few weeks now . It 's very quick and responses to the slightest touch . I got this mouse for two reasons .. it 's black and red color and the side buttons . My last mouse had a side button and I wanted my next one to have it also . Because it 's so quick I had to get used to the fact that the slightest touch gives you motion on the screen . The buttons are placed well , but the side buttons are closer together . If I 'm not careful I 'll hit the front button instead of the rear button . Otherwise it 's a great mouse for both gamers and the novice like me .  
2	  Each and every time I mount this lens on my 1DS mark II camera , I 'm falling in love with Photography again . This Lens is super fast auto focus and deliver sharp and crispy images quality even at wide open F / 2.8 the IS functioning is all about for my handheld shooting on location without tripod , it works effectively and reliable . I can compare and rate this lens almost perfect like my Canon 85mm F / 1.2L but 70-200 IS USM is faster autofocus . With the zoom lens like this shooting on Manual mode is my favorite cause I can make the most beautiful pictures out of this lens . It wasn't true as some previous review said there is a problem with many lenses with serial number of UT08XX or earlier . Honestly ! Mine is UT04XX but it perfect and I will keep it till my last breath .  
1	  The unit I purchased would lock up the screen . Garmin did not provide any solution . Thanks to Amazon , they were very professional and offered a replacement of the product . They were very prompt in shipping the replacement even before they received the defective unit back . Thanks to Amazon . com  
1	  What possessed me to spend $ 30 on a rubbery piece of velcro ? ! I have no idea ! I bought this thing because I was so paranoid about taking my new iPod mini to the gym , and I thought I should play it safe and get the arm band . HUGE waste of money ! I should have just bought one of those wrist bands you can get at Target for $ 1.50 and clipped my iPod to it using the belt clip that it came with . That would have been just as effective as the " official " iPod mini armband , and I would be $ 28.50 richer than I am right now .  
2	  Assembled a desk top computer 6 years ago , using an Antec case which included the original power supply . Computer failed recently and based on the problem I was observing , I felt the power supply was faulty . The Antec Basiq 350 Watt was the ideal replacement . Fit perfectly in the case , and by carefully swapping the connections one by one I was able to repair the unit myself . Problem solved and not a difficult project . Antec product support was helpful with the only question I had .  
1	  I purchased a new PC in 12/11 with Windows 7 Pro 64 bit and realized to late that I did not order enough USB ports for all of my peripherals . I installed this card and it seemed to be okay . However , when I powered down I got a blue screen . I had to pull the plug to turn off the machine . I removed the card and restarted the PC then powered down normally and on again . My PC is healthy - just did not like this card . I have no way to tell if the card was in some way defective - but since it did see two USB devices , I believe there was no problem in that respect . Windows 7 64 bit just did like the card . I am still searching for one that will work with the installed operating system .  
1	  I , as a novice buyer , made the purchase for the first time this trading platform . Been looking for a cost-efficient ( up to U.S. $ 50 ) and a small video camera . Now , after three months of negotiations on the return of bad money with this seller , I will only buy the camcorder Brand name and only in the store . But not here ! This camcorder has come in the mail within 25 days . Good packaging , complete disk and user manual in English . Camcorder light only without batteries , they are very gain weight this device . Seen drawbacks : 1 ) video camera refused to work , if you insert a memory card of 2 GB . 2 ) The joystick to switch and select additional functions did not work . 3 ) Video quality - 640x480 pixels awful and poor without additional lighting . 4 ) Image Quality : 640x480 - horrible as the cheap Chinese phones . 5 ) In this unit there is no additional slots for its power through a network of 220 ( only works on AA batteries 4 pcs . ) . Informed of the deficiencies and the seller has decided to bring this camcorder as a device that does not meet the stated characteristics as nadlezhaschschego product quality . The seller was not against a return , but asked to send this camcorder for my account and checking the disadvantage this seller PROMISED offset all my expenses ( cost of its faulty camera + shipping ) . In the money that amount : Order Total : $ 39.74 + $ 17 ( shipping ) = $ 56.17 . Now I 'm trying to return the money spent , but the seller finds a lot of reasons to not return the money . He says that money back to me - but does not specify an amount , on my specific questions about the payment number , the date , the bank through which the return was - the seller to such questions is not responsible and proposes to require the owner of the money marketplace AMAZON ! This is a fraud ! It is unworthy of work of the seller " James Clutterducks " ! Every word I can confirm correspondence with the scammers ! Do not buy anything from him !  
1	  I bought this external twice . The first time ; it crashed . I thought maybe I did something wrong by leaving it on often , so I gave the product the benefit of the doubt and bought another one . It crashed also . It makes the same sound as the first time it crashed .. I just here clicking and can't access anything . The good news is the external gives hints about when it is going to crash . A few files on the drive will not open and will give an error asking if I want to reformat my disk .  
2	  I got this memory card a few weeks ago to store pictures from my new HP M517 and I must admit : it was a great purchase . It stores more than 350 pictures when the camera is on 5 Megapixel Best mode . I have lots and lots of space now . This memory card is also fast when I transfer my pictures to my PC . It is a very good item . Congratulations SanDisk on this great product .  
1	  Ok , so if you are the average consumer , such as myself , you probably have an mp3 player of some sort . If you own an Apple iPod , then you and I along with 58 million other unsuspecting consumers have been had . BIG TIME . I too fell into the trance of the white earbuds , but no longer will I remain an Apple lemur . I bought a 4th generation iPod and was so excited that I too was going to be sporting the ultimate in mp3 players ! Boy , was I STUPID ! I commute to Boston on the commuter rail , which is about a forty-minute ride into town , switch to the subway for 10 minutes , and then walk to my building in about 3 minutes . I am not a runner so when I say walk it 's a stroll . Nothing aggressive . After about 2 and months with my new toy , the problems began . Freeze ups began to occur in the middle of playing songs . This happened everyday for a few months . I sought help from Apple at their website and performed all steps they suggest to get the iPod back on the straight and narrow . I reset it ( lost all my music every time I did this ) , then a few months later I kept receiving a folder icon with exclamation point . I went back to the Apple website , in which I was a regular visitor , and followed their instructions for the new error ( Put iPod into disk mode and reinstall the driver hardware ) . This happened on and off for the next few months along with the freezing thing . Then the biggie of all biggies started to happen after just one year of ownership . I got , what I thought was cute at the time , a picture of an iPod on my screen with a sad face telling me to contact Apple Support . I proceeded to contact an iPod specialist using the phone number provided by Apple . The first thing I heard that disgusted me was my 90-day warranty was up and now had to either buy an Apple Care plan for $ 99.00 and have support from them for two years or pay a $ 50 per incident fee . Immediately I asked why as it was to my understanding that iPod was covered for 1 year from the date of purchase . I was told that yes this was correct but phone support was 90 days only . If my iPod needed service , I would have to create an account on their website and issue a request for service . I was floored by the lack of help right from the get go . You get three months to have a problem with your brand new almost $ 300 dollar purchase , and then you are told go away to no - man 's land and submit a request , because unless you pay $ 50 or $ 99.00 , human contact is not an option . After steaming for a few moments , I realized I still had a broken iPod to fix . I proceeded to no-man 's land and filled out my service request . I sent Apple my player and waited a couple of weeks for a response . Needless to say , I could have waited forever because the answer they gave was and still is unacceptable . My $ 299.00 technological marvel , my portable music librarian , my expensively priced modern convenience 's hard drive had failed . I was out of warranty by a week or two . I inquired about the cost for repair . $ 268.40 to bring it back from the dead . " ARE YOU KIDDING ME ! " I screamed into the poor person 's unsuspecting ear on the phone . The tech said he gets that a lot and I proceeded to tell him I understood why people scream . He told me the best thing to do would be to buy another unit since the cost was comparable , in fact a bit cheaper at $ 249.00 and I would have a new updated unit . So , being a stupid sucker for punishment , I went out and spent $ 250 dollars on another 4th generation iPod . I intended to buy one as a gift for my boyfriend anyway for his birthday so this justified the purchase for me . I chalked up my lousy experience to a one-time glitch . Couldn't happen again type of thing . Well , guess what ? Please read on .. He started to commute to work and after leaving the iPod in the box for months , he decided now was the time to use his new gadget . He only used it when he walked the 1 mile to and from the subway stop to work . Total 2 miles a day , walking . Needless to say , 6 months of light use and I had another stupid , little , annoying iPod picture with its brainless sad face staring back at me . It was like looking at a kid who just broke an expensive vase and could do nothing but be sorry about it . This time , I thought I was going to get a bit of a break . After all , Apple opened up an Apple Store in a mall close to work . No need to send out the unit . I could get my painful diagnosis in person . So I make an appointment online , as you can't do that over the phone ( you know they hate that human contact thing ) and I show up to the " Genius Bar " to meet the iPod Genius . This guy had the T-shirt that said he was in fact an " iPod Genius " . I hand over the little devil and he then proceeds to tell me what I already knew . HARD DRIVE FAILURE . I never really delved into why this cataclysmic event happened the first time with the tech guy from Apple regarding my unit , so , I figured after spending $ 600 on 2 products in a bid to help build Apple 's employee retirement fund , I wanted some legitimate answers . I then proceed to ask the so called " iPod Genius " why this keeps happening , explaining that this is the second iPod I had purchased in a 2.5 year span and they BOTH did the same exact thing . He then went on to explain that it is a hard drive player and if it is jostled around too much , it eventually fails . He then pointed out a tiny little scratch it had received on the bottom back and said " this player took a fall . Once that happens , it 's only a matter of time before failure occurs . " I then explained that it may have fallen out of my hands once but it was at waist level and fell onto a kitchen floor . Hardly an abusive drop . I was not slamming the thing around like King Kong and neither was my boyfriend . The " Genius " then said that just stepping off the curb the wrong way when a song is playing or changing to another song will eventually cause hard drive failure . I then said to the " Genius " " It states on Apple 's website that you can use iPod for exercise , it 's a great workout companion . My boyfriend and I only WALKED with it and it got jostled enough to DIE ? " So what you are telling me is you CANNOT run , walk , possibly talk , step off curbs ( guess you have to float or fly ) , NEVER drop it , or move it around whatsoever because any or all of these events can jostle it and cause it to fail ? So , stand perfectly still or pay $ 268.40 to repair it or $ 249.00 to buy a new one ? " Of course , the " Genius " sat there dumbfounded and had no response . IS APPLE SERIOUS ! What the H # & L ; kind of product are they selling to consumers ? They market a portable product that needs rubber padding and a steel casing just to be able to use it . The " Genius " however , did offer me 10 % off a purchase of another iPod with trade in of the old one . Did he really think I was going to fall into the white earphone trance for the third time ? Apple should be ashamed of their business practices . But then again , why would they even care ? People think mp3 the first thing they think of is iPod . EDUCATE YOURSELF ! Do the research and turn away from the light ! If the product that they sell is that sensitive , then it should be marketed accordingly with a statement such as : " product needs to be securely fastened to the wall for use . " I am totally disgusted and of course Apple is of no help , as it would affect their bottom line . People please take my advice . Upgrade you phone to an mp3 player when your " upgrade time comes you can usually do this for WAY less than an iPod . Sandisk Sansa e280 is what i purchased and will NEVER GO BACK ! It is an 8GB flash player with an expandible memory slot which means you can ADD MEMORY SPACE ! It has more features than the Nano and cheaper if you do price comparison on the web . Check other companies such as Creative and iRiver for their players and only use Apple for what they should be used for . Making Pies !  
1	  I bought this about two years ago , and was quite satisfied with the print quality . Using photo ink and glossy paper , it produced some beautiful pictures . Unfortunately , the amount of ink it consumes makes it very uneconomical . After spending about $ 75 on two cartridges , and having them run dry after only a few sheets , I gave up . Although I still have the printer , it 's ink dried up months ago and I don't plan on buying any more . It 's more cost effective to burn my pictures to a CD and take them to Walgreens for developing .  
2	  Great flash , with a good throw . The flash did not re charge as quickly as I 'd hoped , but otherwise fantastic .  
1	  My problem is that the " touch " sensitive volume controls on the little speakers gets stuck , either too loud or no sound at all . Oh yeah , you can't do anything to FIX the problem . So , Get a good deal , and then not be able to use them . Ever ask yourself WHY the price deal ? Now you know why !  
2	  It 's 5 years now since I bought this Pioneer Amplifier and up to now it still works like new .. I installed 7 Bose speakers on this amp . and a 200watt Infinity active Subwoofer works really well . All my guest and relatives love to sing and watch movies at my house because of this Sound system . What can I say WOW Pioneer . Woohoo .  
1	  Very disappointing . The construction ( rubber gaskets cheap ) and the plastic chasis were of low quality . The unit is not very practical , requiring 6 " C " batteries that drain quickly . The A / C power cord ( not included ) can't really be used in the shower . Although the buttons function well , ultimately the poor audio quality couldn't justify the cost .  
1	  When this product arrived it was aparent that it was opened and most likely sent back defective before being repackaged and sent to me . Iset it up only to find that the speakers did not power up . then I had to repackage it and send it back .  
1	  I purchased this from a different online dealer that is has a very good reputation , but it was having light meter problems right out of the box and all of my negatives were either over / under exposed . To verify this , I took the camera with the 28-70 lens to a local camera repair shop and they verified my problems with the light meter and told me that the lens was underexposing as well . I tried to talk on the phone with the company that bought out vivitar but they wouldn't budge and kept me on hold for 40 min . Extremely rude customer service . When they came back they just kept telling me that they could do nothing even though I have a one year warrenty ! I finally got help through their email and sent everything back . Got a new camera and they fixed the lens ( maybe , I still think it is a little off ) free of charge . Avoid the hassle dont buy this camera kit . If you have the money get a nikon or canon , its a much safer bet even if used .  
1	  This item is incompatible with my ipod nano . Its waste of money .. I will be returning this item and looking forward for the refund ..  
2	  I was verry peased with the camera ! This is the second camera I had bought from this site and would not hessitate to buy again !  
2	  These aren't the sturdiest sleeves available , but they are just fine for what I need . Price is good too . I expected somewhat better quality associated with the Maxell name but I can't complain , they do the job . Last brand I bought before this was Memorex . Similar quality and price . I am hesitant to buy no name brand sleeves with bad reviews so I will stick with these or Memorex .  
2	  I used this in China and works very well . Used it on my cell phone charger , tablet and also computer .  
2	  Easy to use and easy to install . Worked immediately with no problems . Very nicely put together .  
2	  From the minute you lift the box you know you 're dealing with a heavy weight .. most of it in the sub-woofer . Setup is straight forward . The audio wire is even color coded to prevent phasing from reversing polarity . The sound is full and dynamic giving life to surround sound movies and games with quality expected from significantly more expensive speaker systems . The only drawback when using this system with a computer is the shear size of the sub-woofer and speakers . It 's tough to squeeze it all into a typically small workspace . In my opinion Logitech has created a 5-star thouroughbred for the serious gamer or movie aficienado .  
2	  I borrowed this item from a friend and used it for a cross country trip . I also got an FM modulator to plug it into my car cigarette lighter so I could hear it through my car stereo . It sounded pretty good and was great when I couldn't pick up any good radio stations .  
1	  I have had this player a little over two months and I have some very dissappointing and disconcerting news for my fellow consumers . First , I bought this on impluse and now I 'm reaping a bitter harvest because my Rio Nitrus is basically an mp3 zombie , allow me to expain . I bought it remanufactured off of Overstock for about $ 75.00 ( msrp >$ 150 ) and had misgivings from the start ; impulse purchases tend to be ones you regret and this was out of character for me , I even considered sending it back without opening the shipping packaging but when it arrived curiosity got the better of me .. damn ! Well surprise , when I opened it I found it in pristine condition and it did not appear to have ever been owned before , and I really scrutinized the whole package , it really looked perfect . ( If I may back-track for a moment . After my orignal order I went immediately to Amazon to check-out consumer reviews and I was rattled , lots of negative comments and pretty unanimous . So when I got it I really , as I 've said , wanted to send it back but .. . Anyway , I gave it a shot and boy am I sorry . ) After a very short time the player would start-up and then shut itself off ( while trying to listen to music ) at random intervals and then sometimes on again .. and then off again and on .. etc . I 'm sure you get the idea ! Then just the other day I went to delete some old songs and download some new ones and my OS kept crashing and continues to do so to this very day . Yes I tried the firmware updates and all other applicable software fixes , they were totally useless and I even reset the player .. worthless . So , in review , I cannot delete old or import new files , my player turns off / on at random intervals with increasing regularity with each passing day so the handwriting is on the wall , my player is on its way out , eg . zombie mp3 ! Finally , what I believe to be a trace of irony . Seems like once you have one of these infernal gagets it 's hard get on withoutone so i 'm shopping again and now that I 've got religion i 'm doing the requisite research . Turns out all these gagets ( drive or flash ) log the same or similar complaints regardless of price if they have been owned for any modest period of time and owned by any number of consumers . Bottom line .. the man is sticking it to you , good luck . As for me I will play mine till it dies and then I will toss it into the GOM just as far as I can ! PS . I thought I read or heard somewhere this company is ethier folding or getting out of the digital music player biz . Have a nice day !  
1	  I upgraded from the 990 to the 995 . I use this camera commercially . The reason for the upgrade was that the 990 had burned out pixels which had to be painted over with Paint Shop Pro on each photo used . Impossible to contact Nikon , so I put up with it . The 995 also has burned out pixels and has problems in loading to a PC . The great Nikon camera company goes down the toilet in my book . I 'll go back to using my 35mm Photomic , or buy a Sony Digital .  
2	  Over several decades , have purchased printers from Brother company . Each has been trouble-free , and all remain in operatonal condition . Other brands have good products , but none better than Brother . Only slight negative for this latest purchase is that instructions seem rather limited relevant to initial installation . However , installation and operational features worked perfectly from initial installation .  
2	  I have used many high quality binoculars ( Germans included ) and this is my favorite , especially to take on trips or mountain hiking , where space and weight are crucial . These binocs are light , small enough and bright enough . Plus they are wide-angle , and close focusing . And perfect for use with eye glasses if you wear them . Wrap your hands around these binocs , brace you hands against your forehead , and they offer an incredibly stable view , which makes up for their low magnification . Great for most bird-watching . I just wish i had these years ago .  
1	  I have had this product for a couple of months now and loved it , until it stopped working randomly . I have tried it in a number of computers and I get nothing . Just from reading reviews in various places , the drive seems to stop working for a lot of people after 2 - 5 months . Its very annoying since Lexar is advertising its " durability " . It seems to be hit or miss . Some say they have used it a ton and never had a problem and many seem to have it suddenly break down as it did to me . It was cheap though and for the price it was a nice little toy , but it clearly isn't really much more then a toy . If you get one , be sure to backup your files to a computer often as you risk losing all your saved data someday . All in all , I would not recommend it . Price is good , but remember , you get what you pay for .  
1	  I got this Tiffen 52mm filter free because I had bought a Nikon 35mm lens . At first I thought this should be an awesome filter because it is made by a good company I heard about before , but there is reflection and flare in your picture when you take them . So , I decided to buy a different filter . I ended buying the sigma dg multi-coated filter . Just looking at the filter you can tell the difference in quality . When putting your finger in front of the sigma lens you can't even see the lens at all , but do the same thing in front of the Tiffen filter and the lens is very noticeable . I would recommend getting the Sigma filter . It only cost like $ 10 more for something of WAY higher quality in build , performance and size . PS . The metal edge of the lens even came a little scratched up , which wasn't the case with the Sigma  
2	  I was one of the first people to get the Rio Volt . I ordered it shipped 2 Day FedEx to me direct from Sonic Blue . When the Phillips eXpanium first appeared , I convinced three of my friends to purchase the drive . I am glad I waited . This drive has everything . It comes with a remote , AC adapter , batteries , headphones . The size is quite light and it 's shaped in a circle like a cd . It can play not only MP3 's but WMA 's which sound just as good but take up alot less space . That means you can probably fit 200-250 songs on the player . Try that on your portable mp3 memory card players . 80 min cd 's hold 700 megabytes . The top of the line memory players hold 64 internally with an option of an additional 64 . This still brings you to about 1/5th the capacity of the RioVolt . No resume option ? No problem , update to the latest firmware ( yes , you heard me , you can update the firmware to support new features ) and you will have not only resume to the correct song , but the exact location in the song as well as shuffle and repeat modes ! GET IT NOW !  
1	  Do not buy this printer for any point of sale activity . It prints very slowly even on the draft setting . The machine also eats toner ink quite fast . Outside of that I guess it is alright .  
2	  This product is a true life saver . I was traveling to work when I forgot to send the regional reports to my office so I got my phone out and my pocket pc and of course my Socket CF modem connection and within minutes they were sent and my job was saved thatnks to Socket CF .  
2	  I bought this quick release adapter to attach to my Slik SBH-320 ballhead . Compared to my experience with the quick release mechanism of my Manfrotto 141RC tripod head , I found the QRA-635 very unobstrusive . The very slim QR plate when attached to the camera never gets in the way when I stuff my camera in my bag , so the plate remains on my camera 24/7 . I like using it so much that I bought extra plates for my other cameras . The likewise slim design and light weight of the adapter itself makes it seem to be an integral part of my ballhead , that I usually forget it 's just an adapter . Mounting and unmounting the camera to the adapter is fast and simple . Once mounted , the camera ( a DSLR ) is held securely . This is one very admirable simple gadget .  
1	  This Que drive was a big waste of money . It frequently locks up my PC while making more noise than a blender chopping ice . After several tries , I finally managed to contact someone at QPS , and was told that some drives are just noisier than others . I will never make the mistake of purchasing another item from QPS . I am sorry that I can't rate this item lower than one star !  
2	  This is the second one of these Samsung MP3 players that we purchased . I bought the first one and when my husband heard how well it sounded , he wanted one for listening to music in his shop . We were looking for something with great sound , light weight , easy to operate , and would not cost a fortune as we only wanted something for listening to music while walking or working in the shop . This little MP3 player fills the bill . Was much more than expected .  
1	  I received this for a Christmas gift and hoped it would help me with my Chicago area commute . I did a bit a research trying to figure out the skinny on how this unit gather traffic information and report it . As far as I could tell from the few reviews I read MSN was no better or worse than TMC . Some had good things to say others not so good . There seems to be a lack of information to find out who or where the FM signal for TMC or MSN is being broadcast from . So it 's not like you can look at cell towers and figure out if you 're going to have coverage . Garmin 's site gives this generic map covering , of course , every place in the Chicago metro area and Milwaukee metro coverage overlaps it to the north . This unit comes with the gt20 TMC receiver built into the recharger / power cord . I am coming from the 60031 zip code area and commuting south to elk grove . The first thing that I do is plug this thing in to get a look at traffic on 94 south . OOps , I had this for two weeks and have never seen it work out of my driveway . It usually doesn't get a ( green ) turn on signal until it becomes 294 some 13 miles away from where I start . When leaving work 60007 I have only once got a signal to give me the traffic conditions to give me an option of the route I could take . I have updated the software , again this is two weeks old and the software is out of date . Wow , that 's sad . I have experienced on route 22 heading towards Barrington the garmins outdated map . It doesn't have the interchange / bypass with 12 being there and panics and tries to reroute you on roads that aren't there . Sadly you can't even change the traffic you subscribe to . It is specific for each unit , msn is the 580 , and I have no clue if any pilot series picks up xm 's traffic I couldn't see it from their site . I am returning this and holding out for the dash express as my next best option for traffic . As it will get its traffic from two different sources , one , other dash units gps information and two , traffic . com .  
1	  I spent more money on this CANON battery because I thought it had a better quality than other brands which are compatible with my canon camera . But this battery can ONLY work for taking at most 10 pictures or 5 min video . SO there must be quality problem in the product . Moreover the appearance of this so called Canon Battery is very different with that of my original one including the words on the back side ( of course the side with CANON is similar ) . I will return it and never touch the product from this supplier .  
1	  It works well as a standard gigabit ethernet switch , but if you are looking for jumbo frame support you really should look elsewhere . It works well as some other reviewers on other sites have said up to around 6k packets , after which packet loss starts to increase . Additionally you can find analysis of this switch online showing blocking after about 4.5k packets , with a performance cliff around 7k packets . This is exactly what I saw , and would cause my fairly expensive Intel e1000 NIC to reset its own port back to 100 mbps . According to what I 've found online there are actually two models , so it could be this problem is only with the original model ( which I purchased in 2007 ) . Anyway , I replaced this switch with a managed gigabit dlink switch and now have no problems . Anyway , it works well if all you want is regular gigabit , but stay away if you need reliable jumbo packets .  
1	  This is a great printer in most ways . Easy to set up , fast and reliable good quality printing and very good value for money . However : The reason I only gave it 2 stars is that the out put is poorly thought out . It is supposed to be able to print 100 pages . if only this were true . It is more like 10 pages . I find that I have to stand and watch and every 10 pages or so I have to pull the printed pages to leave room for the rest of the job . If I don't then the pages coming out push against the ones already printed and the pages go every which way and out of order . The longer the print run the hotter the printer gets the more the pages curl and the fewer pages before I have to remove them to make room . This is a real pain as I frequently have documents to print which can run from 40 to 120 plus pages . I have to stand there watching and whisking piles of papers off the printer as they get too big . I have better things to do with my time . Even though the printer is ideal in almost every way I can not recommend it for this reason . People who only have small print runs may ignore my feed back .  
1	  This is the fifth printer I 've purchased , and the worst by far . While the print quality is good , the Canon software needs serious work . Supposedly , and according to Canon , the application should control the paper size and orientation ( a no-brainer in my book ) , but I 've had problems printing even from something like WordPerfect . Instead , you have to set up the printer properties with what type and size and media orientation you 're trying to print . Every time you change media , you get to do that all over again . And , heaven forbid , you don't also adjust the paper thickness guide for the thickness of your media , you 'll have to clear an error message for that .. Then there 's the delightful dialog box which pops up in the middle of your screen telling you you 're printing . DUH . You 'll need to minimize or close it in order to keep working . And if you run out of paper , you 'll get it again , even though the printer will also flash an error message .. After less than 48 hours , I 'm tired of throwing away paper goods , tired of having to do so much work for so little .. If you want to do virtually any editing , even sizing , you 'll need to look to other software . I could have been much happier with something much less expensive , too-I don't see the price justification . I 've made a terrible , terrible mistake ..  
1	  This product is poorly designed ! It 's little more than a hard drive with batteries . Something as simple as organizing mp3 tracks by artist is not available . Or album . That makes organization a nightmare . Archos should not have released this product without better functionality . ( Archos 's FAQs recommends to organize with folders . Give me a break . What if you want to play by artist one day and album the next and then style the next . That just it 's possible . ) Archos should update and release improved firmware quickly .  
2	  I like it so much that I 'm ordering two more for gifts .. nice buy nice price ..  
1	  I ordered this part and plugged into my computer and my printer . It does not work , I sent it back and amazon was great at taking real good care of getting another part out to me . I have the new one real QUICK ! I plugged in the second new part and it doesnt work either . The complaint is that only one side works , So there is no advantage to this part , I can only run one thing at a time . I need to have my computer and my printer both plugged in at the same time . Dont Buy This Part . I really like Amazon , I dont like this part . IT DOESNT WORK . BUY ANOTHER BRAND . Steve .  
1	  Worked on small flash cards , but not my 4 GB Flash card . I returned it .  
1	  learned my lesson .. never buy a .. product .. got the apex ad 800 last december , it broke down for no apparent reason two weeks ago under normal use .. first started noticing red led lines across the screen , but the player was still working manually .. next thing i know , it went completely out , like somebody literally pulled the plug .. emailed apex about the problem , wants me to ship it for repairs ..  
2	  I have been looking at various microscopes for online for over a year . i came close to buying a celestron digital scope but was turned off by the reviews mentioning poor quality plastic components . I was ( and still am ) skeptical about the LCD display as well . I looked at a few other scopes as well - Amazon had an offer for a microscope with 2000X of magnifying power . The trouble with going over 1000X , however , is that you need oils with special optical qualities to make use of the microscope . I wanted something simple and yet not a toy . I have had this for about a month and really enjoy it . I am slowly buying various sets of slides and find the scope more than powerful enough for to satisfy my interests at this point . This scope is very well built ( or so it seems to me ) with all metal parts . I would say it 's a better scope than some of the lower end scopes I used on college when I took a series of biology classes . I have used celestron telescopes as well - I once owned a fabulous 4inch refractor that I stupidly sold while in college-and have always been impressed with the quality of their products for the money .  
2	  NO more laying awake in bed listening to the ball game ! Now my husband can enjoy his late night sports and I can get some sleep ! He says the sound is very clear , and you can adjust for static if necessary . I should have bought these headphones 10 years ago ! Great investment !  
2	  Item received quickly and in perfect condition . Kit includes two tools needed to open iPod case . Once opened , the battery was simply unplugged and the new one installed . The case went back together in less than a minute . Let 's be clear : opening the iPod is tedious work . It took me about 15 minutes to carefully use the tools to release the 12 catches that hold the case together . The tools were perfect and once I learned the " pry and slide " routine the case came apart without any damage at all . I 'm very satisfied .  
2	  When I first plugged this item in I couldn't find a frequency that it would work properly on . However , on the second try when I had a few more minutes to fiddle with it and try more frequencies , I found one that came in perfectly clearly . I love this thing ! I used to use one that only had 4 possible frequency settings and ran on batteries through the earphone jack of the iPod . This way is much better ( full band of frequencies available , including even tenths ie 88.2 , runs on vehicle 's power through the charging jack of the iPod ) .  
1	  It leaves a shadow and bright hot spot light . I need a larger flash with indirect flash to avoid hot spot .  
2	  This was my first PDA purchase and after much soul searching I settled for the Windows Mobile PC platform . I am certain that I made the right choice despite the comments by those who believe that Windows Mobile has a long way to go aginst Palm OS . The choice fell between Toshiba e355 and iPaq 1935 both selling for $ 199.00 . I opted for Toshiba e355 since iPaq was offering a measly 90 day warranty ! Granted iPaq 1935 is perhaps more compact and smaller than Toshiba e355 but the performance of Toshiba rocks and I have no regrets . Both my PDA and Windows Mobile 2003 have worked flawlessly and has been very stable till now ! I do not know why everyone is complaining of absence of CF card slot when price differential between CF card and SD card has narrowed considerably . I got a SanDisk 256 Mb SD card for 59.00 after rebates only slightly more expensive compared to comparable CF Cards ! What can I say about Toshiba e355 ? Performance is impeccable . Very stable and so far reliable . I have added a few software , FlexWallet and ACDSee Mobile and both work flawlessly ! I have transferred my address book from Outlook and few other data including several photo images from my desktop using Active Sync and everything is working well . The only complaint I have is about the non removable battery . However I am fairly certain that in about three years time , I will be upgrading this PDA and I am not overly concerned about the battery replacement issue ! I have no hesitation in recommending Toshiba e355 to those who are looking for a base level PDA but do not intend to carry it in their shirt pockets ( iPaq 1935 is more appropriate ! ) Have fun using Toshiba e355 !  
1	  I ordered the AFW-4300 from Amazon , when installed the PCI Card it was not recognized by the computer . After several days trying to find out the problem I ordered another FireWire card by a different manufacturer . It worked fine . I then started trying to return what I consider a defective product . Amazon and Adaptec refused to accepted it , and advised that I get a RTM from the seller . The only problem is the condition in which they want the product returned . It must be in the original container complete with all of the appropriate stickers . When I tried to remove the PCI Card from the plastic container I had to cut it to pieces , therefore I cannot meet their standards for a return . I therefore will write it off to experience and be more careful where I buy in the future .  
2	  You have probably read all the product specifications by the manufacturer and other publications regarding the performance and features of the Studio DV . Based on my experience , I can assure you that Studio DV performs as well if not better that all the claims in the product reviews . Installation was a snap with no problems . However , you may need to stop all other programs running in the background ( Norton anitivirus , monitor power-saver , etc . ) to provide maximum system resources to Studio DV . Before doing this , some of the icons on the screen appeared jumbled . This is explained in the troubleshooting portion of the manual . The video capture in " preview " quality works great - it simply shows what you need to know while you are editing . After capture of your scenes , you can select any scene and scroll through it by moving the scroll bar . Ditto for the transition effects and titles . You can add your own narration by using your computer 's microphone as the preview window plays the scenes . You can then come back and adjust the fade and volume levels of the narration track and the other two audio tracks . This is very powerful ( but simple ) editing features that I was very amazed to discover in Studio DVSound editing capabilities are amazing for a product at this price level ! You can see the " wave-form " representation of the audio so its much easier to sync a particular part of the audio to the video ( such as an audio " bang " sound effect to the video " explosion " ) . The titling software that is included is A + . Why would you need anything else ? I have used $ 1000 titling software and although I had some additional " whiz / bang " effects , who needs that all the time . The point is to make a great title , put it where you want it quickly and easily and be able to customize it to some reasonable level . Studio DV lets you do all of that . In summary , if you need to edit you Digital 8 or DV videos quickly , simply and with minimal learning curve and hassles go with Studio DV . I can see even pros using this on thier home movies ! You have everything you need to make great looking movies . Good Luck  
1	  I bought mine 2 months ago , and for no reason at all , while i was taking some vids through my camera , it stopped functioning . I was unable to read the device and now its waiting to end up in the bin . The travelite works fine so far .  
2	  Speakers perform as expected . We use them to listen to local radio over the Internet ( we have lousy antenna reception at our house ) and Pandora radio . No complaints .  
1	  i 've had it for around three months ( never dropped it ) and a few days ago all of a sudden it stopped working and it had nothing wrong , and then after a week when i was about to throw it away it started working again . dont even bother buying this junk .  
2	  I 'm stunned by this tinny digital camera ! So little and so many functions .. I recomend it .  
2	  Some parts of the UI can be a little tricky at first , but any trouble is vastly outweighed by the greatness of the player . Stop reading these reviews and buy it already .  
1	  After purchasing this camera , I was rather disappointed at the quality of the images after I had uploaded them on to my PC . As a result , i took it back to the shop immediately , and exchanged it for the Canon Expo 4MP equivalent in price , which I can not be happier with . It is superb .  
1	  Tried 2 unites with my Alcatel 1000 DSL modem w / SBC . Modem access is fine , and Netgears FVS318 router works fine . But 2 separtae WGT 624s I purchased cannot connect to the internet through the modem . Netgear 's support is slow and non responsive . They haven't fixed the router or refunded my money and they take 2-3 weeks between emails before responding at all , and when they do respond , it is with no soluction . I 've spend over 10 hours on this with nothing but headaches .  
1	  like everybody else says , worked great at first , after about a year started to not turn on at all or turn off for no reason during movies . dvd player is junk . won't buy sony again . can't believe they 've gone down hill so far and fast .  
1	  The product appears to be everything one would want in a printer - the problem is the drivers . Not only do the drivers take 700 + MB of disk space which is outrageous , but they crash often . In addition , the programs that come with the printer are unstable . Good hardware , poor drivers make this a pass .  
1	  I purchased the CX7000F printer as I already own the RX500 printer and was very satisfied with it . After receiving the printer and downloading the drivers from Epson that supposedly would work with my Vista Home Premium operating system , I attempted to load the drivers . The printer driver installed without a hitch and works fine . The scanner driver , however , would not install and I have spent over 2 hours with Epson on the phone to no avail . They advised me it wasn't their problem and that I should reload the operating system . The scanner and fax both work fine as a standalone , but I can't access them through the computer . To make matters worse , I have only had the unit for about 2 weeks and have only printed a few black and white documents from MS Word and from the internet and my ink levels are down to 36 % for all four cartridges . At this point it is my intention to consider it a lesson learned and to return the unit within the 30 day window .  
2	  These buds stay in place really well during a long jog . The sound quality isn't a good as the Sennheiser Noise Canceling ear buds , but if you 're only planning to use these for high impact workouts , they 're the right tool for the job . My only complaint is that the cord is very prone to tangling .  
1	  I love the way you can easily access / change DVDs with the flip-top style of player . And we hooked up my daughter 's V-Smile with no problem . HOWEVER , within 30 days of purchase , the little tab that holds the cover shut had broken . I contacted customer service and sent it back for repair . Within 2 weeks , the OTHER player began to malfunction . A few emails were sent back and forth , and finally I discovered that if I used masking tape to hold the cover shut , the machine would play . I called to check on the other unit as I was told it would take 4-6 weeks for repair , and it had been at least 6 weeks at that point . The agent had no record of my unit being returned . When I gave him the tracking number I sent the package with , he said that it had made it to one location , but that location had not forwarded it to their repair location , and that he would ship me a new unit , which would arrive in about a week . It 's been almost 3 weeks and I still don't have anything back from the company . When I try to call , the number stays busy . They are no longer answering my emails . I never sent in the second unit for repair , and I 'm glad I didn't . When it worked , the machine was nice , but it didn't work long enough for the price . I still have my Coby unit , and though it 's a pain to change DVDs , at least it still works more than a year later ! I will NEVER buy ANYTHING from Venturer EVER again !  
2	  I have a 30 gb ipod , and have had several mp3 players before . This 2 gb device was purchased for my jogs . It performs wonderfully . There is a short learning curve to organizing songs into folders , but I love the sound and the tiny featherweight package is easy to carry about . The radio is not as good as the one on my old iaudio , but still it picks up the local stations well enough . If the radio were a bit stronger , it would get 5 stars . Highly recommended for joggers .  
1	  Batteries do not retain their charge for any length of time , even if they are not being used . I charged the batteries for use in my golf GPS . Put them in the GPS a 3 days before I played . The device was not turned on . I had low batteries indicator as soon as I turned the device on , put in the spare batteries which were supposedly fully charged and had the same problem . I get 4 rounds of gold out of regular batteries and have yet to get a single round out of the rechargeable batteries .  
2	  I needed something to protect my new home theater components . This fit the bill . I was looking for something that would do the job in the price range I had and this worked out well . Some of these units are very overpriced . This one was a fair price and had all the features I wanted such as the surge protection but also the power filtering since I will have a air purifier and mini fridge and other things in the immediate area that have the potential of causing electrical noise . That combined with the 8 inputs made this the right choice . It also looks much more substantial than most units prices this low . Like a component instead of a power strip . I am a bit skeptical about many of these products but in this case I think I got what I paid for . It displays the voltage which is nice and works as described . If it works well and looks good and is priced right and has enough outlets to cover the use I think that is a sign of a product being appropriate for use . We do have power outages several times each winter due to wind blowing trees in to power lines and I have a HD projector and other home theater components that I want to protect and have confidence this will do so . Also I believe I will have the quality power sans interference I am looking for from this . Unlike many products offered by this manufacturer I think this one is priced reasonably . It is much more substantial than a simple power strip and with expensive components I think it is worth spending the money on something of better quality . I would not run a coax though this or an ethernet cable . These devices are known for doing more harm than good to signal quality , I would avoid those features . But thinking if it as a well made power strip with a display and you will be getting those features which do make a difference , if not exactly in the way the manufacturer claims .  
1	  Bought the web cam for my kids to video with their Nana . Unfortunately , this product will NOT work unless the user has full Admin rights on the PC . Since my kids only have User permissions in XP Home Edition , the camera is useless . This " feature " was confirmed by Logitech 's technical support . I wish I had known this before I bought it .  
1	  I have owned , and returned 2 of these cameras , and I prefer Olympus . The features , from 10X OPTICAL zoom , to noise reduction for open shutter exposures , are terrific . Two bad the images recorded are unuseable .  
2	  Dear Sharp Zaurus SL-5500 : I just wanted to take a minute to let you know how important you are to me . I probably don't tell you this enough , but you make a big difference to me in my life . It is strange to think that it was only a few short months ago that I first started thinking about buying you . You seemed so aloof at first , so distant . I didn't know what to expect . I mean , I was pretty sure that I wanted to be with you . But I wasn't sure we would click as well as we do now . I really enjoy being with you . Inputing data is so easy with you . And you came with so many great applications . True , at first , your battery didn't seem to last as long . But now that I have charged you a few times , it seems as though your battery is lasting longer and longer . You were fairly easy to sync with my Windows 2000 O.S. And I was easily able to transfer address book information from my old Palm IIxe to you just by beaming . How bright your colors are ! How fantastic the stereo sound performs ! How fast your processor runs ! How expandable you are ! I have easily been able to find stuff to install on you , everything from games to mortgage calculators to task managers , etc . Many useful informational websites about you exist , and they all help me grow closer to you . Anyway , I just hope that we can continue our great relationship together for a long time to come . All my love , Your owner  
2	  This is my third canon camera , and my favorite . I decided on this older model because of the wide angle lens . It really helps to fit everything in for a group shot or large subject ( house ) shot . You will notice some barrel distortion ( curving of image around edges ) if your subject has long , straight lines ( bridge or rooftop ) and fills the frame . That 's just how a wide angle works . You won't notice it at all if you are taking shots of friends / family . Pros : Small , Light , fast response time & great picsCons : When pointed close or directly at sun or extremely bright object , the screen will show green and black patches . The picture will be fine though .  
1	  I thought the quality of the product ( materials , snaps ) was fine . The problem is more of a design flaw . The lid sits just on top of the CDs once you put them in , so it 's not really secure . It would 've been a perfect box if it was taller than the height of a CD .  
1	  This item was a " deal " with the purchase of a ROKU . Poor quality cable not worth the money . Not shielded , lots of interference on equipment .  
2	  Just picked up 6 packs of these QuickLock connectors for my home theater system . The connectors are very sturdily built and are actually a bit heavier than I expected . Audio quality has improved slightly due to the good compression on the speaker wires and the tight fit to the back of my speakers and receiver vs . hooking the components up directly with speaker wire . The connectors could be a bit cheaper , but it 's not really a big deal . You can find them cheaper on the internet , but I refuse to do business with some of those places ( RitzCamera , ANTOnline , etc . ) . Just read the reviews and you 'll know what I 'm talking about .  
2	  The player is awesome ! Light , compact and user friendly . I do not like the big bud style headphones and have since purchased in ear buds and it sounds great !  
1	  I got this in the mail today with hopes of watching a movie on my tv but I don't get any picture on my screen ! I really feel as though I have been played a fool by this company and suggest that you just buy cables made directly by your mp3 player manifacturer .  
2	  The cables work and the images from my DVD player , cable box and apple TV all look great to me . I 've had one of these same exact cables for about a couple years now and all 's good . I just placed two new separate orders for these within the last week a few days apart . Got each within just a few days of ordering from SFPlanet . The first time the cables shipped the same day , and the second they shipped the following day .  
1	  buy two units and one this burnt one , I am in venezuela and I cannot return it . i would pay too much in shipment , I lost my money . compre dos unidades y una vino quemada desafortunadamente soy de venezuela y no puedo devolverlo pagaria demasiado en envio perdi mi dinero .  
1	  This alarm system was bought to protect my garage . The install was super simple , and the unit worked well in the house . The reason for my low rating was because they advertise a 450 ft range for the sensors , but at about 60 ft it would not work . It all fairness , I was told by a local alarm installer that none of the wireless units will transmit through aluminum siding . If you have any siding besides metal I assume it would work .  
1	  I ordered and PAID for a 2 GB mini SD card for my niece to use on her mp3 player . Unfortunately , I received a 1 GB card instead . I 've sent several emails to the company ( including one via Amazon ) with no response . Don't order from this company or you might be very sorry .  
1	  I bought these headphones for use with my macbook . I wanted something wireless and mobile to use in the office . The nice thing about these headphones is that they can connect directly to the bloothtooth on your macbook ( a previous bluetooth headset I bought only connected to its transmitter ) , and the play / pause , next / prev buttons work with itunes without any additional software . Unfortunately , the sound quality is fuzzy at best , and clearly meant for something less audibly demanding , like voice chat . My laptop speakers sound better than these !  
1	  I have received two of these B W UV filters and one of their polarized filters from amazon and all three are filthy with dust and smudges . Is this normal ? Or am I getting returned items ? If it is normal one should question B W quality control if they are shipping products this dirty out . Am I being unrealistic to expect them to be clean ? Any input would be appreciated . Also , the boxes were sealed with tape on only one side , not both . Again is this normal ? Seems useless to seal one side and not the other ..  
1	  Completely agree with Tieum : do not buy this battery . I bought a JVC Everio camera , which comes with this battery , right before my trip and was very disappointed : the battery lasted for less than 1 hour . If you are mostly taping outdoors , like I did , you are basically screwed .  
1	  Doesn't work and it cost more to send back then its worth , So I am stuck with it .  
1	  I purchased this camera from a local dive shop prior to going on a trip recently . ( I didn't buy it from Amazon because I needed it * immediately * . ) The casing seemed solid , and looked like it would seal well , but I never ended up trying it under water , didn't take it on my trip , and returned it as soon as I got back . The problem was noise in the image . Under reasonable shooting conditions - indoor with a reasonable amount of lighting , plus flash , at the " ISO 100 " setting , the noise was intolerable . It was worse than I 've seen at ISO 800 or higher using name-brand ( canon , etc . ) dry-land low-end consumer digital cameras . To demonstrate this , I 've uploaded a sample image ( cat at water dish ) . In my experience with underwater shooting with disposable cameras and an occasional underwater " consumer-grade " rental , there are enough things underwater which show up as visual noise on pictures - little bubbles , silt , water salinity variations , etc . I suppose there 's an argument that says that the camera being noisy will , therefore , not have much of an impact . My feeling is that adding a lot of noise will just make the image that much worse . My feeling is that the ISO 100 results were unacceptable , and shooting underwater would often use higher ISO settings ( which , for digital cameras basically mean more noise ) , so this camera was a no-go for me .  
1	  Oh they look good and are comfortable . Only one problem : they don't work . The left earphone did not work right out of the box . This is clearly the result of poor wiring or a short in the unit and poor quality control .  
1	  had to return as it didnt work for SD card , first bad exp with amazon .  
2	  I 've had this set for about two months now to replace an old Mitsubishi rear-projection TV that finally gave way after about 15 years of use . This would be my first experience with an HDTV or any of the latest generation television sets , so keep that in mind when reading my review . The good : - Crisp + bright HD picture - Setting up the remote was incredibly easy . It can control upto 5 devices . It is labeled as TV , CABLE / DBS / DTV , VCR , DVD , AUDIO . - There are component connections in the front of the TV , making it convenient to plug in game systems , camcorders , etc . The bad : - For those that are quick with the fingers , you 'll be disappointed - when pressing buttons too quickly on the remote , theres a delay in response . ( e.g. you click three times quickly , it processes the first request , pauses for a second , then proceeds to the next command . ) - On occasion , when switching to an HD channel , you 'll come across a blank screen . To remedy , simply flip to another channel and back , and the HD channel should appear . - Volume Control : If you press volume up or down once , it 'll only bring up the menu . You must press 2 + times for the volume level to actually change . Also , HD channels are generally louder than SD channels . - SD channels don't look that great ( from what I hear , this is the case with all HDTV sets ) . - The layout of the remote control is rather poor . The location of the ENTER button is fairly far away from the # ' s . There also lacks the chapter navigation buttons ( skip chapter forward / backward ) . The ugly : - " Prefer Digital " - I don't have a digital cable package , but was pleasantly surprised when my local stations had digital signals . However , these digital channels are programmed as " subchannels . " If for instance you have a channel 2 ( analog ) , the digital channel would be on 2-1 . Thats great and all , but makes channel surfing a bit more difficult . There is an option to prefer digital channels when there are both digital and analog signals on the same channel . Great right ? The analog channels disappeared , as did one digital channel . Removing the " prefer digital " option , you get all the analog channels back , but all the digital channels disappear ( Rescanning didn't work ) . One workaround is to reset the TV settings , and re-scan all the channels . I have yet to contact Mitsubishi about this issue , but after doing a google search , I 've found that there are many others experiencing the same problem . * Edit : I found the HD channel ! For some reason , the channel * moved * . The HD channel was originally 11-1 , and as a result of the " prefer digital , " it has moved to 5-1 . Now I have TWO 5-1 channels . My first channel 5-1 is CBS ( as it should be ) , but my second 5-1 channel is now NBC HD . In order to turn to that channel , I must go from CBS and scan up , or 6 and scan down , cannot just input 5-1 . A bit of a hassle , but at least I have my HD channel now ! Some of these complaints seem silly don't they ? You 'd expect a TV costing so much money wouldn't have these kinks in ' em . I purchased this TV with the stand . I have it on carpet , and it is HEAVY ( as you would expect for a 62 " TV ) . I 'd recommend purchasing those " furniture movers " to place under the legs of the stand to move it easier .  
1	  Got rid of the cannon printer because it was not an all in one , and actually I did have a problem with Cannons ink cartridges and they said it was my machine .. I said ok and got rid of the problem and boughjt an Epson , great machine love it  
2	  using an HDMI cable , this dvd player does it 's job and does it well ( sound and picture ) .. seems like a solid player to me . and for all those whining about load times .. 20 seconds is a bit of an exaggeration .. maybe 10 or 11 seconds . god forbid someone would have to wait a few seconds for a dvd to load in this age of instant gratification .. never could figure out the logic on the load time thing .. whatever . This is a quality product . Take your time ( patience again ) and set it up for HDMI ( or whatever input you use ) .. tv / picture type .. and sound .. etc .. takes a couple minutes and you 're good to go . If you 're not sure .. read your " owners manual " .  
1	  Let me start by saying I was really happy when I heard iPod was going to get some competition . But the Zune fell flat . After owning an iPod mini ( which I was happy with ) for about three years , I decided in July to get a new mp3 player . Hearing rumors about a full-screen iPod with touch-screen capabilities , I decided to wait . Then I heard about the Zune . A bigger screen than the iPod , WiFi enabled , AND I figured , as it is competing with one of the most successful electronics , it has to be very good . Wrong . The Zune is a prototype . I thin Microsoft rushed to finish it before the holiday season , and it shows . The WiFi isn't good at all , and there aren't enough other Zune-users to use it at all ( I have yet to find a good use for it , and I go to a college in the city ) . Since the Zune service ( one pro to this product ) doesn't have videos or tv shows , the screen size doesn't matter . The screen is clearer , but I am comparing this to an iPod mini .. so .. The color choices ( while limited ) offer some pretty unique things , but I agree with one reviewer that it looks like iPod 's ugly step-brother . It isn't cool looking , and it is semi-clunky . Another disappointing feature is the limited number of options . There are three Zunes , in comparison to I think over 10 iPods . There is no cheaper , smaller nano equivalent , and for those on a big budget , there isn't any shiffle or SanDisk size player . Microsoft needs to fix this . Now , a few pros . The Zune music Store has a subscription service . This is much more convenient that . 99 cents per song . Despite this tough , there doesn't seem to be much music available , and as mentioned , no videos . Like iTunes , you can only play these songs on a Zune , and you can only put songs on your player from the store . The back engraving is the final pro ( pathetic , yeah , but cool ) . " Greetings from Seattle ! " .. a smack in Apple 's face . Despite the engraving , this product isn't good enough to knock the iPod off it 's high horse . My suggestion is not to buy an mp3 player this season . If you were going to get one as a gift , give a rain check . Apple is rumored to be releasing an iPod phone in January , and the Zune lineup will likely be expanding too . Wait . The Zune will probably get better , and Apple appears to be making more technological jumps . Pros-Zune Store subscription-back engraving - FM TunerCons-bad sound quality-bigger screen is useless , as there few to no videos to watch-little to no WiFi capabilities-clunky and ugly-lack of modelsall I can suggest is to wait .. wait until 2007 !  
2	  These binoculars are certainly worth the little money spent on them ! They are excellent ! My husband has used them for hunting and my daughters and myself have used them for birdwatching . They work perfectly ! Couldn't ask for better !  
2	  Digital point-and-shoot cameras have come a long way recently . I 'm not a photography expert by any means , but this camera works suprisingly well for me . Especially nice IMO is the manual mode . I recently too a huge number of pictures in the forest , where flash is pretty useless but light levels are too low for most point and shoots .. and the image stabilization plus the abilty to set the ISO and color balance by hand made a huge difference . However , the " image stabilization " isn't really * that * good . It makes all the difference for some low-light no-flash shots which would have otherwise been impossible , but isn't enough for many more shots I wish I could have gotten . This is the first point-and-shoot I 've had where I really wanted a tripod ! Not because the camera is bad , but because it is actually good enough to get the shots / quality where a tripod would make a difference ( and most point-and-shoots , at least older ones , would be hopeless ) . BTW : There is a 2 sec delay mode which is obviously intended to make up for the lack of remote .  
2	  I bought this TV a little over a week ago and it was been great so far . The standard cable looks surprisingly well , as well as regular DVD 's which look amazing . I mainly purchased this for use with my Playstation 3 and it truly is a thing of beauty on this TV ! 1080p just blows me away , especially since I am pretty new to the whole HDTV scene . This is one of the best deals you will find out there for a 1080p television at this size and Sharp is one of the best LCD manufacturer 's out there ! Don't be afraid to pick this baby up . One issue I have been having is with the sound . The normal sound on the TV is pretty good , but I have not found a way to switch between Mono & Stereo sound . The TV seems to be default set at Mono , and while watching some cable shows , I see in the corner where it says what channel you are on , that it is switching between stereo and mono which is very annoying and there doesn't seem to be a way to change it . I tried all the settings and nothing worked so I dunno what the deal is . Anyway , if anyone knows a solution to this please let me know !  
2	  For the price , this Targus bag exceeds expectations . It comfortably fits my Sony VAIO and all the peripherals as well . You can't beat this deal , I highly recommend this bag . There 's no need to spend so much when you get quality products much less .  
2	  Ok , that said this cartridge is not in a box but in a plastic bag . This , however , doesn't mean the ink isn't great . It is ! I 've been using it and it seems to be of the same type as the boxed ink . A really good buy !  
2	  Needed a good quality HDMI / DVI cable for my plasma TV , but didn't want to pay for the Monster Cable hype . This cable works great and the quality is fantastic .  
2	  This is my 4th apple computer , and the first apple desktop . All I can say is it is well worth the money . I bought it for my kids and also wanted to keep it in the living room , something that does not take too much space , and looks nice . I have to admit , I am using it to a fair degree too , and I like the software programs that come with it . Overall , I think it is money well spent .  
1	  This product could have been very good . The problem is that it seems it was never tested before release and the firmware was never finished . The " power on / off " button doesn't even work . You can't complain to Netgear as the support site email trouble reporting doesn't work either . Half of the remote control functions are non-functional . The only way I can turn it off after use is to unplug the power cord , then when I plug it back in , it powers itself up , then the power button works to turn it off . Seem to be literally hundreds of bugs in the original firmware and there is no sign of an update release . The strange thing is that the tough stuff works ( WiFi , PC library interface , etc ) and the simple stuff fails . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS NETGEAR FIXES THE FIRMWARE .  
1	  This fax machine is very unreliable . I used it mostly for sending faxes . Sometimes the faxes would go through without a problem . But more often then not , it would give me a " poor line condition " error message when trying to send multiple pages . So if I needed to fax mroe than one page , I would have to fax them literally one page at a time . This is frustrating and time consuming b / c then you have to dial for each page . I would not recommend this fax machine .  
2	  The dryer hangs up well and is really handy to use . I use it every three days and do not have to look for it or plug it in ; it is already there . The dryer works well .  
1	  Ad is misleading . Item is 4-5 years old , not " like new " , one antenna is missing a cover and there was no power unit as described . Seller offers to buy it back shipping at my expense which I see as unfair  
2	  Used an APC surge protector like this for my computer station . It worked wonderfully for 7 yrs and until our house was flooded . This is a replacement .  
2	  Easy to mount ( running the wires through the wall and under the house to the stereo inside was the hard part ) , and now I have music outside without having to turn it up super-loud inside . They sound great !  
1	  This dvd player was purchased as an extra for a bedroom . It kept opening and shutting by itself and would not read any disc inserted in it . It also makes a loud noise when it opens and shuts . Needless to say it went back the next day .  
2	  I bought mine factory refurbed : came with auto bundle . About the battery 's short life : there 's an after market battery upgrade that I found listed here in amazon . com link : $U$ ad says 1500 mAh @ 3.7V so that 's triple the OEM bayyery ! The battery cost about $ 25 and comes with two screwdrivers and instructions on taking the iQue3600 apart . WARNING : taking the Garmin will void your garmin warranty .. SO BE WARNED ! All in all , I am having a great time with the GPS on my travels . around the USA .  
1	  Before you read this you should know that after my review is posted , someone from Panasonic will post at least two reviews to refute what I say . That being said . . . I bought this camera almost exactly two years ago and was very pleased with the quality of the pictures and the ease of use . Then , one day it just died on me . I went on the Panasonic website and filled out a repair order , gave them my credit card info for the diagnostic charge and mailed it to their repair center . Ten days later I called to get a status on the repair and was told they had not even looked at it yet because I had not paid the diagnostic charge . I gave the representative the info on the confirming email I have received and she said she 'd take care of it and I would be contacted within the week with a status report . A week later when I called again , I was told , again , that I had not paid the diagnostic charge therefore no one had looked at the camera . There was no record of my conversation from the week before and , unfortunately , I had not gotten the name of the representative to which I had spoken . I then gave them my credit card number , again , and was told I 'd be contacted within the week with a status . After another week , I called back to be told that the repair center was backed up and they had not had an opportunity to look at the camera . I asked to speak to a supervisor and was assured by Joe Martinez that he would have an answer for me by the end of the day and would call me back in person . He not only didn't call me back but when I called him two days later he still didn't have an answer . Finally , after over a month of back and forth , I was told that the entire lens needs to be replaced at a cost of $ 382.08 . Now , I realize that the camera is only warranted for one year but it seems that the lens on a $ 600 camera should not need to be entirely replaced after only two years . Therefore , I tell you not to buy this camera . Not only is it unreliable but dealing with Panasonic is an exercise in frustration .  
1	  This may seem like a good value , but in reality it is simply works like one of those cameras you can get at a drug store but just to take digital photos ( and poor photos at that ) . The zoom is 1x or 2x and nothing in between and the LCD isn't a good representation of what you 're actually taking . I had to actually download photos onto my computer before I could see if the photo was any good . My suggestion is to go with something a little more higher priced . When the accessories easily add up to more than the actual unit , you have ask yourself if its really a value or cheap for a reason .  
1	  I bought the Archos 2.0 . New . It did not work ; wouldn't turn on . Sent it in for repair ( Archos has no 1-800 number , which means a long wait on your dime ) . Returned the recorder , at my expense . Weeks and weeks passed-much longer than the 10 days Archos represented as the average turn-around time . When the recorder was returned , it was 10 , not a 20 . Archos returned a cheaper model . Called them up-same routine : 35-minute wait . Answer was , " We do not have any more 20 models . We can not send you a replacement . " If this type of service and product quality appeals to you , then by all means buy from Archos . On the other hand , if you want a recorder that works and has 3X longer battery life , buy a Sony .  
2	  I 'm adding this review because I was very nervous about buying this product because somebody had previously commented that they received absolutely no customer service from Cisco . I bought the product , and like other people , I couldn't figure it out . It was just over my head . You really do need to be a network engineer or very network savvy to configure this firewall . However , I called up Cisco Customer Service and they were incredible ! Seriously , I had to configure the firewall for a PBX server . I gave the Cisco customer service guy all of the requirements that the PBX company required , in terms of all of the port forwarding and configuration etc . , and the Cisco engineer literally logged into the firewall and configure the entire thing for me ! I was blown away . I thought I was going to have to hire somebody to do it , and he just did it for me . I 'm totally happy . Everything is working perfectly now . Pretty amazing in my opinion . I just called the regular tech support phone number on their website . If you need this powerful of a firewall and don't know what you 're doing , in my experience , Cisco will take care of you .  
1	  I primarily purchased the product for recording lectures and it did not work well . The Mp3 recorder records the lecture , afterwards , recording is really bad . Sometimes it doesn't record at all or it erases the file or there is an error . In addition , the volume / sound quality is bad . Not loud enough . In the end , you need the software to transfer files , takes forever to figure out what to do . My brothers bought Mp3 player called Matchspeed ( red color ) , good price and it worked great . Best player we ever had , 3 times louder then scan disk and the best thing , no software needed to transfer files . Just drag he items into the folder , thats all to it . And it records great . I hope this advice will help saving everybody 's time .  
2	  I was pleasantly surprised by the time it took to receive the product and pleased with its price and efficacy .  
1	  I ordered the items on the 11th Nov and had an indiaction online that delivery would be made by the 1st DecWhen I tried to make a review on the 1st Dec the online info indicated that I should expect delivery only between the 1st - 16th DecThis was the first I had heard of this . I wrote an email to the seller and to date have NOT had a replyNot a very happy customer  
2	  I got this to hook myApple iPod classic 80 GB Silver ( 6th Generation ) up to my bookshelf stereo system to listen to in my room & dorm room when I go to college next month . It works perfectly . Also , it 's nice that the cord is retractable , so there is less clutter . The only problem with it is that , with the iPod Classic , the video out is through the base , so you basically need Apple 's dock to hook it up , which was not advertised on this cable 's page .  
2	  Needed a large quantity of CDs for a college course ; these did the job nicely .  
1	  See Title . Wish i did get the right memory but im using it now . Not a big deal it works . but its simple a wrong delivery  
2	  This flash works great . It recharges fast . The price is too high .  
1	  This one-button mouse for the Mac has only an ADR port and no adaptor to connect the mouse to a USB port on a newer Mac . I 've tried four times to contact the seller to return it and am still waiting for a response . If anyone has any way of getting an RAN from the seller , that would be greatly appreciated as I already purchased another mouse , since the mouse I previously had died , and this Macally was supposed to be a replacement for the one that broke . I thought that this mouse would have come with the proper adaptor to connect it to my newer computer , but it was nowhere to be found in either the packaging or the box . The Apple Store thought it was a PS / 2 type . When I went to Staples to buy this type of adaptor and try it out , it would not fit this mouse . It is therefore unusable and is in need of being returned to the seller for a complete refund .  
2	  The Palm m100 is a great handheald . I would recommend it to anyone looking to buy something that can really help them keep organized . You can use it as an assignment book for school , and it is also great for games . There are thousands of games , free and purchasable , on the internet which you can download and install into the palm . Of course , it would be better if it had a little more memory , because with only 2mb , you cannot have all the programs you want installed at one time .  
2	  I 've had this handheld for a year now . To be honest , it was given to me as a Christmas gift , and I wasn't exactly thrilled about getting it . I was like , " What do I need a datebook for ? " I am eating my words . I love this thing ! Not only can you use it to jot down your appointments , but you can set alarms and look WAY into the future . There 's a world clock , memo pad , a to do list , a decent calculator , and much more . However , what I like best is how you can download tons of games and share games with other handheld owners . I have bought Word and Excel to go on my handheld , and I 've purchased the fold up keyboard , too . With this , my handheld is better than a laptop ! I can work on papers at school without lugging around something huge ( which is ideal for any college student ) . Plus , it 's super easy to hotsync ( storing stuff from your handheld to your pc and vice versa ) ; all it takes is a touch of a button . While I love this handheld , it does have a few flaws : 1 . Sometimes it freaks out , and you have to reset it , losing your info . However , when you hotsync , you get all the programs and files back ( that you have saved on your PC ) on it really quick , so you never have to reinstall software or anything . Plus , you can buy an attachment for about $ bucks or so that acts like a disk , so you can save your info . This is handy , so I suggest getting this if you are going to be doing a bunch of work on it . 2 . It 's not in color , and from what I 've seen so far , you can't get pictures or anything on it . ( If I 'm mistaken , then I 'm sorry ) . 3 . If you like cuteness , then you may not like this one . There are many cooler looking handhelds out there ; this one is kind of dull . However , for the price and its capibilites , it 's worth the buy , no matter how it looks . - This is a great choice for a first handheld !  
2	  Cartridges were exactly what I wanted and was received in a timely fashion . Would order again . I always stock up on this item .  
1	  I loved this keyboard when I first got it . As other reviewers have noted , it occasionally missed a keystroke , or would even duplicate keystrokes , but I assumed this was par for the course with a wireless device . After about 6 months , performance had gradually degraded to having to hold the keyboard in just the right position to get it to recognize even a single keystroke . Another few weeks , and the device didn't work at all . I bought a replacement ( the RMA process for Adesso seemed like a hassle , and I didn't have the original box which was a requirement ) and the new replacement keyboard is worse than the first ! Right out of the box , the touchpad doesn't work at all , but it does appear to be sending a left-click periodically , often when I 'm nowhere near the keyboard . I 'm going to have to take this one back immediately . If the third time 's not a charm , I may try out the Logitech diNovo Mini instead . - Update : 2009.9.6I have owned three of these keyboards ( am typing on one now , in fact ) . I don't have experience with other wireless keyboards , so I can't compare it to others , but I can tell you what 's wrong with this model , with plenty of qualified experience . MY SEETUP : I use this keyboard as the intnerface to my home-theater PC , which is attached to my television 6 feet in front of me . I sit on the couch with the keyboard in my lap . The receiver is connected to the front of the PC and there is a direct line of sight to it from the keyboard . Sometimes I sit 1 foot away and stitll have these problems . As you can see from mthis review 's text , the problems with this keyboard are evident . CONS FIRST : - misplaced / delayed keystrokes . Typing " letters " you 'll get " leterts " or , as I have gotten twice while attempting to type this bullet-point , " letterrs . " Which leads me to .. - repeated keystrokes . It is merely annoying when you type " This keyboard blows " and get " Thiss keyboaard blws . " But it 's * PAINFUL * when you use a keyboard shortcut and this keyboard repeats it ad infinitum . Example : use ctrl + backspace to delete a previous word - this keyboarrd will often continue to delete words as long as you hold the ctrl key , deleting entire paragraphs . Exampmle 2 : use ctrl + F4 to close tabs in the browser . Doing so on this keyboard will often close every single tab you have open . - unresponsiveness . Sit with the keyboard facing the computer and you 're ok ( with only occasional typos ) . Lean back with the keyboard tilted upward , and you get this : theuickroewfox jumpedver the lazyThat 's my attempt at " The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog . " Yes , I typed everyy letter . PROS : Makes a great gag gift . I 've had three of these keyboards because at some point eachc one has exhibited the same problems , and each time I have lived with it until I couldn't take the torture anymore . Save y ourself the heartache , learn from my lesson and do not buy this product .  
1	  Pretty much a waste of money . Has to have special wireless dongle - not standard 802.11X . Realistic range 10-12 feet , not the 30 ft claimed . Won't work with the majority of USB devices I have tried . SAVE YOUR MONEY !  
1	  Don't waste your money on this . It does not work . You 'll have much more success just copying files via an external hard drive .  
1	  Don't do it . I have one and it doesn't do half the things they claim . And HP just discontinued the printer and shipped the support over seas .  
1	  Sony and Visor have different warrenties . When my Visor broke , they overnighted a replacement . When my Clie broke after I was put on hold for 1/2 hour , they told me that they would not send me a replacement . Instead , they sent me a box which I used to send back the defective product for repair . A week later ( all time without the product ) the Clie was returned . And shortly thereafter , the product failed again . I recommend taking the warrenty into consideration in choosing between Sony and Visor  
1	  I purchased this HDMI cord for my Sony Bravia 32inch 1080i Tv , and i was totally disappointed . 1 . It made my TV show horribly ( even in HD ) 2 . It kept jumping everything i would try and watch something and 3 . I could usually watch my TV on 2 different outputs , with the HDMI cord in i could only view it on 1 channel . It was basically a big waste of time . I dont know how there are all these " Good Reviews " on here , because i missed how " GREAT " this HDMI cord works . Keep your money PLEAASE !  
1	  Let me start by saying I have owned many radar detectors in my 36 years of driving . This has got to be the worst one I have owned . It has no filtering of false alarms . It goes off constantly , and I 'm not talking one or two beeps , I 'm talking full alarm , with nothing in the area ! My last detector was also a Bel and I loved it . It eventually broke and I had to get out an old spare that I kept , it drove me crazy with all its ' false alarms . I couldn't wait to get another Bel , but this one is worse than that old cheap one . Sorry I threw it out the day the Bel came . This was a total waste of money .  
2	  I love this device . It gives me all the functionality I need & more . I only have one major complaint : It comes with a cover that does not give you access to any of the function keys , so every time you want to do something you have to take it out of the cover . They do sell a cover with access to all the ports & function keys , but they want another $ 29 for that . Why not give you that instead of this cover ?  
2	  Well , its a well made CAT6 cables and works perfect . Arrived in great conditions .. Oh and the heads are easy to plug and unplug and their cover protects it from breakage .  
1	  My Batteris are dead , I put them in my camera and they didnot work . I want to return them . I bought them in May , 2005 I just open them August 14 , 2005 . I rate them a " 0 " Betty J McDonald701 Oats St # 309Texarkana AR 71854shebj @ aol . com  
2	  This stuff safely cleans , without leaving streaks , on the aforementioned electronics I 've used it on . Even when my toddler smudged my laptop 's screen with maple syrup hands , the large marking came out without issue ( although I wouldn't recommend testing this ! ) . The product comes in a 9 oz container ( for me it should last years given the amount needed for each job ) and a re-usable cloth . I would not hesitate to buy again .  
1	  Do not put your laptop on this product without a good gripper pad under it to hold it in place ! I LOVED it for the 20 minutes I got to use it . BUT with my 15 " laptop it was top heavy and unstable . The bottom was too smooth on my smooth tabletop . It was bigger than I thought and the edge was just over the edge of my laptop table . A little jiggle and the whole thing slid , then fell over ! SCREAM ! My laptop is DEAD and being shipped off for a new hard drive . SCREAM !  
1	  Media code is MCC 01RG20 , which is Mitsubish Chemicals Corporation . They have an excellent reputation , which is why I was so surprised that this media is as bad as it is . I 'm using a Plextor PX-708A with the 1.08 firmware revision . The first 4X burn produced a coaster with tons of bad sectors , and visible dye damage . The second at 4X also had visible dye damage , but my recorder was able to read each sector . My Sony DVD player ( older and picky ) couldn't read it . A 2X burn produced something my DVD player could handle ( at least the title screen comes up , and the titles start playing - haven't checked playability across the entire disc ) . There 's still visible dye damage , so I 'm skeptical . Having bought this media so I could burn at 4X to produce something my DVD player will like ( have to burn at 2.4X with my + R media to achieve that ) , I 'm quite disappointed with the results .  
1	  This printer produces beautiful pictures , ( when it works ) , I liked the idea of not using ink cartridges , you know in advance how many pictures you will be able to print . After a little while ; and I mean a very little , like 3 months ; it started having problems puling the paper , it will either just jam or say that the ink needed to be replaced . Until it finally stop completely working . Don't buy this printer , you will waste your money .  
2	  easy to use . silences about 90 % of the static . you can set it up for any station , then set your radio to that station and it sounds good . It 's not an audiophile 's good , but it 's fine for a car , which has more noise through regular operation than the background static in the songs .  
2	  No complaints here .. the product as awesome , cleaned my records and got here in a real timely fashion . I will use again .  
1	  I have owned this printer for quite some time and had no problems printing or copying until - I needed to scan some documents . The documentation on setting it up is useless . The printer itself and my computer simply do not recognize that scanning is available . After reading many bulletin board entries , uninstalling ( beware add / remove does NOT uninstall the programs , including Image Zone , which is like a house guest that refuses to leave ) and reinstalling both from the original disk , another installation disk I ordered from HP ( thinking that my original disk had a problem ) and the HP website , I contacted HP 's chat help line . Oh what a nightmare . He told me to install windows installer patches , . NET updates , cleanup utility , etc . Reinstall . Still no scan for documents , only images through the wizard . Having invested many hours into this by now , I simply could not give up and initiated a second tech chat session . After 45 minutes we nailed it to a corrupt file . Uninstalled , reinstalled , NO SCAN function . I am frustrated that this is so difficult to fix , that the HP installation programs don't work . There are no uninstall programs . I will be putting a Brother All-in-one into my shopping cart next .  
1	  After only two months of use , one of the headphone wires pulled loose and now only works from one earphone .  
1	  It played fine for a week and then it stopped playing sound out of the left speaker . It only plays on one side . Quite annoying when listening to the Beatles or other bands who use each speaker for different sounds instead of one homogeneous sound out of both speakers .  
1	  Well the Zen was purchased as a gift for my father for father 's day . My brother liked the features so much that he purchased one shortly thereafter . However we have been unable to get one that even turns on . I 've downloaded all the product support from Creative Labs , as well as the new firmware . The frustrating part about it is this is the second unit that is DOA . My brother purchased his at a local store and works flawlessly , were my father 's came from an online source . The stupid thing will not even turn on . And it takes " 4 " weeks to get a new one ? ! I 'm not really happy at the moment . My brother 's functions awesome , no trouble at all , and he loves it . My father 's however is well .. well you get the point . Sorry B & H. ; I spoke with the tech folks in " India " and they suggested a trick to get the batteries to fire up . The problem they said was the unit had sat too long and run out of juice . So they recommended that I plug and unplug the unit 15 times waiting about 3 seconds before replugging the unit . Amazing it worked and things are running just fine . So the problem is B & H ; Photo Video .. must be why their price is so low .. over inventory on the shelf too long .  
1	  I love the design of this stand , and the material its made from . But I 've had some major problems with slippage when putting my macbook pro on it . It won't stay on the stand at all = (  
2	  This piece is really light and very powerful . This be best for bright conditions .  
1	  Sure I 'm an " L " snob I suppose , but I wanted to try the Tamron to see if I could just carry one lens on an upcoming trip . The lack of sharpness and ability to focus in a rather large depth of field were among the short list of things I didn't like right away . I shot pictures at a wedding for a friend .. and was VERY disapointed . This morning , I tried one more experiment , catching a blue jay out in our oak tree . Could hardly tell the blue jay from the tree at 70 mm . It was just a black blob . I pulled out the L and did the same shot with crystal clarity . The lens is easy to use , light weight , and as others have said .. if you don't require the sharpness .. it is a perfect lens for the price .  
2	  Am a newcomer to the world of SLR photgraphy , and after researching a SLR for a few weeks , I had almost decided to buy a canon / nikon . Honestly , did not even consider pentax in my research , and just to see how the rebel and d50 looked and felt , I visited a ' camera store ' and asked the sales person for these models . I also asked her for her recommendations , and she sneaked in this lovely little camera . The pentax surprized me as a package . It was a delight to hold , felt perfect in my small hands and then after a couple of weeks of more research , where nobody complained about the picture quality or the quality of the product , I knew this was it . I will not go into the specifications as they can be found on a zillion websites and for sure this camera ' lacks ' certain features but which one doesnt unless you have $ or more . In the past two months , this camera has been to numerous hiking trips and I have always got great pictures back . It has ' survived ' a few raindrops as well occasionally when the clouds caught me unprepared with my backpack , but I would not recommend taking any chance with that . As a beginner , an SLR does have some initial learning curve involved and be prepared to ruin some shots if you forget to change the white balance , or other settings . I have just started using raw , and realized the advantages . Almost everything is good about the camera . But it does seem to underexpose a little on the auto modes . Also there are not many lenses made specifically for this camera by pentax unlike canon / nikon . I am not considering third party or older pentax lenses here . This might be a drawback . But I feel that unless you want to go professional , the choices are adequate . To sum this review , I feel this camera is a great entry level SLR which is easy to use , nicely built , delivers quality results an on a budget . I also got a couple of adobe photoshop manuals , which I feel is a wonderful tool along with my camera . Thank you !  
1	  I went cheap and got the remanufactured version instead of the new one . It worked great-good sound , very comfortable to wear for long periods ( though in part due to the loose fit , which means if you tilt you head down they fall right off-but I didn't downgrade it for that because it 's part and parcel of them being so comfortable . Also the AA rechargeable batteries are easy and cheap to replace when needed . You could even use standard AAs in a pinch ( just don't use the charging cradle if you do that . At least I think so-the voltage is slightly different . The one star rating is because one channel failed shortly after the 90 day period expired . If they 'd failed at the same time with a new pair I could have had them fixed . I went on using them ( mainly I listen to talking heads ) , and a year later the channel suddenly popped back on for a while , then failed again after a few days , and hasn't come back since . Consumer Reports generally recommends not buying remanufactured products , believing , I think , that they aren't really remanufactured . That was certainly my experience with this product .  
2	  Great item . Speakers are loud . Only complaint is can't get AM very well .  
2	  I got the Sonic Impact for my college daughter for Christmas after extensive internet research . I chose it because it was pretty highly rated for sound and durability . Well , I can atest to the durability because the postman put it in the middle of the driveway in one of those grey rain bags and I didn't see it over the slope of the driveway , so I ran over it . My husband had to jack the car up to get it out ! The outer box was crushed , the inner box was half crushed , and I knew there was no hope . I called the post office to start the damage claim procedure . Then I opened the boxes and found an intact Sonic Impact . It certainly lives up to it 's name . My daughter uses it all the time and loves it .  
2	  I was looking for an affordable lens to take on vacation with me and this one performed great . The large aperture is great for shooting in low light at all focal lengths ( not quite like my 50mm / 1.8 , but I enjoy being able to zoom ) . Part of me wishes I had bit the bullet and gotten the new one with IS , but I got some really nice shots with this lens . I 'm going to get rid of my kit lens because this one is SO much better . Totally worthwhile purchase !  
2	  My first every Ebay score , the Canon EF-S 17-85mm lens ( featuring image stabilization ) was a much coveted item around here . It had come highly recommended and seemed to be a great complement to my beloved 50mm prime and a perfect replacement for the 18-55mm kit lens that shipped with the XTi . Initial , first-night impressions ? Heavenly . Compared to the other lenses that I 've put on the business end of the XTi , the 17-85mm is one heavy dude . I 'd wager that it 's at least as heavy as the camera and certainly feels as heavy as the 50mm and the 18-55mm put together . The lens is serious . It means business . It traveled back in time from the future to be here with us today . It 's a touch of the photographic high-tech , made accessible to the amateur . With my right hand on the shutter and my left on the lens ' barrel , it didn't feel any less heavy but " heavy " , in my mind , became " solid " . The auto-focus is nice and quiet and is reasonably fast to lock onto the subject . The focusing ring is also nice and big - it cries out to be grasped and twisted . It was a joy to realize that even with the auto-focus turned on , the lens would not complain if I fine-tuned a given shot with some manual adjustments . ( The AF doesn't totally commandeer the focus , that is to say . ) The zoom is also smooth , the barrel moving quickly and easily without over-shooting the desired focal length . Image stabilization is also a big plus . I have a feeling that once I get the hang of it , it will save quite a few low-light , indoor , and hand-held shots over the lifetime of this lens . This isn't to be nave and believe it to be a cure-all . Certainly a few of my early test shots with the IS feature on prove that you can still wind up with a whole mess of blur . But others worked out pretty well . After having used it for about two weeks or so now , most of these initial impressions have stayed true . The IS feature is a good one but isn't something upon which to rely to save every shot . You still need to have good light and the right angle , etc . ; but with the right ISO setting , it can save the scene . The heavy feeling of the lens is something I 've gotten used to pretty quickly ; after a couple of sessions , you just expect the camera to weight that much - no worries . I 've also found that the longer focal lengths are great for portraiture - I find myself using focal lengths in the 70-85mm range pretty often now and I wonder how I ever lived without them before . That said , I 'm beginning to wonder a little about the lens ' chromatic aberration . I 've had a few shots that don't seem to " resolve " the same way during post-processing ( in Aperture ) as similar shots under similar conditions with the same camera body and a different lens ( e.g. , the 50mm prime ) . This is not to say that I have my mind made up and am squaring the blame on the lens - certainly not ! But I am trying to parse my way through some of these , experimenting with some different conditions , etc . to see where it lands . I 've just fallen into a certain rhythm with my post-processing and I would hate to have to learn a new dance just for the one , new lens . All things considered however , I 've been very pleased with most of my results from the 17-85mm thus far .. so yeah , worth it . But with respect to " worth it " : Canon lists a retail price of $ 600 for the EF-S 17-85mm IS lens . Most places online seem to offer it in the $ 475-$550 range . As far as lenses go , this is hardly a costly one . Considering that this is one of the two lenses " given away " as the kit lens for Canon 's 40D body , you wonder a little bit if the mass-production maybe watered it down just a little bit .. ? Just the same , this is a great " walk-around " lens : it is sturdy , has some great built-in features , and has a versatile range of focal lengths . If you got this lens " free " with your camera body then you are in luck . If you 're looking to pick up one separately .. Well , it 's a great lens to have . And I 'm happy with mine . But see if you can't score one on Ebay or through your local re-seller of high-quality , previously enjoyed lenses . Happy shooting , y'all .  
2	  I 've been looking for a few weeks now . My sister has the Panasonic 60U 42 inch , which they paid $ 2100 for in the summer . That tv is awesome and I think the picture is great . Since the price dropped to $ 1199 , my father bought the 60U , and I bought the HDS69 for $ 1425 at Boscovs minutes later . The salesman actually tried to talk me out of the Hitachi and into the Panasonic , saying consumer reports rates it higher and what not . I chose the Hitachi over Panasonic for a few reasons : the design is far superior , the resolution is higher , it has the 1080P virtual processor , the swivel base is great , 3 HDMI inputs , and just by looking at the picture alone . I have a home theater , but don't always feel the need to turn use it . Luckily , the speakers in the tv are EXCELLENT.I just hooked it up using the included HDMI cable from Comcast . The picture on analog signals are decent , the digital are great , and the HD are phenomenal . I 'm in no hurry to spend $ 100 + on a monster cable . So far Boscovs is the cheapest I 've seen from a Major department store , not from a no name Internet company . I wish it had a memory card reader like panasonic . Other than that , it is the best purchase I have made in a long time .  
1	  Many people who enjoy this player seemed like they had never operated one before . Of course the ESP would work if you " smack it or even drop it " . Do you have any idea how ESP works , obviously not . It is stored in an electronic memory for 40 seconds ( or whatever ) until the song gets to that part . By dropping a player , you physically can't delete this information . ESP - & gt ; & gt ; Electronic Skip Protection . I say get the $ 70 ones .  
2	  This is the way to go if you ride bicycles , motorcycles , rent cars . The mounts are by far the best in the industry because they are so small and easy to travel with . The GPS is wonderful and this is my third version of the eTrex . The colors are easily seen in day light and the unit is so simple to operate . My suggestion .. Buy It !  
1	  We purchased our brother printer less than two months ago . From the get-go , we had issues , but mostly when we tried to use cardstock . The printer / copier consistently jams , and yesterday the paper feeder broke completely . Customer service has been non-responsive . The price was cheap , but not that cheap . Other printer / copier / scanners in the same price range do not self-destruct within six weeksI do no recommend this nor this company .  
1	  As far as sound goes , this system is really nice . But before you buy it on the net go to a real store and play around with it . It takes an enormous amount of time to eject a cd from this box , switching cd 's is really slow , and you have to stop the music if you want to insert another cd . These problems might sound minor , but they are not unless you dont mind taking a nap while you try to insert a cd . Also , there is about 15 seconds delay between every song when the system is in the ' random ' mode with more than 1 cd . I just bought this system and Im so annoyed by this ' lightning speed ' cd changing mechanism , Im going to ship it back tomorrow .  
2	  I have one at work and now one at home . Does exactly what you would expect with no issues . Let me save you some grief though .. If you are trying to boot from the floppy and need to set your BIOS to have the floppy drive first in the boot order , make sure you have the USB floppy drive plugged in before powering the computer and entering the BIOS setup . If you don't the computer will not see that a floppy is available and will not give you the choice of booting from it . Hope this helps .  
1	  I was very disappointed in this product , and returned it . Thekeyboard you had to poke at , was very cumbersome . Also , the organizerwas poorly laid out . It was almost unusable . I had to remove the software to sync-up my pager . The Palm II was only $ 30 more , and does tons more .  
1	  This product has received some good reviews , but I have to say I don't recommend it if you 're not a very savvy geek who enjoys assimilating lots of byzantine technical detail . The manual is laughably filled with IEE 802.11B jargon that you 're supposed to be paying THEM to simplify for you . Alas , they think you 've signed up for a Master 's level course in electrical engineering . When you click the Help button in their software , it brings up boxes that say ' Paste the help text here . ' Don't you just love paying for unfinished software ? Get another brand , I 'd say . There is a paucity of support information on the Linksys site , and what is there is only really readable by engineers . When you call their tech support , they are brusque and say they 'll have someone call you back . Ha !

When you click the Help button in their software , it brings up boxes that say ' Paste the help text here . ' Don't you just love paying for unfinished software ? Get another brand , I 'd say . There is a paucity of support information on the Linksys site , and what is there is only really readable by engineers . When you call their tech support , they are brusque and say they 'll have someone call you back . Ha !  
1	  Pointless product . No point backing up data onto CDs and DVDs when the labels will fade at around 6 months . Garbage .  
1	  These relays are NOT 5 pin relays . The connector is 5 wire but the relay attached to it is only 4 pin . Now I know why others are having issues connecting these up . It 's probably a waste to return these items . This vendor is getting away with false advertising and probably not getting many return due to the low cost . They have complaints on other sites as well .  
1	  Had this camera for just under a year , and encountered similar problems to other users . Now , I 'm no photogropher so while others comlained about its poor photo quality , with valid reason , that didn't bother me as badly since it was my first digital camera . However , the1 ) loss of a 100 + photos , 2 ) corruption of mem . cards , 3 ) sudden loss of power with difficult reboots4 ) horrible and gahstly battery life , and5 ) the now total loss of power with no reboots , Makes this a just an awful buy and total waste of money . Even for a first time simple user like me . This camera should be max $ 50 . Bottom line , PLEASE-DO NOT BUY !  
1	  WHY CAN'T I GIVE NEGATIVE STARS ? DON'T BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER SONY CAMERA ! Sony makes crap cameras and their support will accuse you of breaking it . Purchase from a respectable camera maker like Canon , Nikon , or Fuji . I bought this for snorkeling and it corrupted my memory card on the first trip . OK , $ 10,000 trip with no pictures , because the camera corrupted the memory . Called Sony and they blamed the memory . Got two new memory cards for the next trip . OK , new trip , $ 5k trip with no pictures because the entire stupid camera craps out . Called Sony , no apologies , no emergency loaner , just a send it in with the receipt so we can verify it 's still under warranty . Sent the camera in to the depot , on my own dime . They call and accused me of opening the camera door . What idiots ! Why the hell would I do that ? So I can ruin my pictures ? TWICE ? ! I contacted all the way up to national customer support . All idiots along the way . They didn't do a user test underwater . They just dunk it and say it 's still WATER-RESISTANT , so it must be user error . F # $ % OFF SONY ! Whatever you do , buy something else and save your money , this is a horrible product , that takes horrible pictures and is slow as mud , with a horrible touchscreen that doesn't work .  
1	  Bought this to go with my Zire 31 . The case fits well - although the cover itself is just a flap - no closure . For carrying around in an outside pocket on my purse its ok . If it were just another piece of floatsam in my suitcase of a purse , I can't imagine it would do much good . Its a little difficult to get the stylus out of the back when the Zire is in the case , but not impossible . The stylus is cool - a blackpen , an orange pen , a pencil and stylus all in one . It took me a few minutes to figure out exactly how to switch from one to another - but I managed . The screen protectors are ok - nothing spectacular . Don't follow the lines printed on the screen cover when you trim them to fit your PDA - the lines for my Zire 31 are a bit small . All in all , this is ok - but I think next time I will try to find a better case . I would advise any PDA noobs to buy the PDA , take it with you to a store that sells cases and pick one out from there .  
2	  I bought this with the length adapter to use with my Korg metronome when playing drums . I needed something wider than a typical mp3 holder and this fits beautifully . Go ahead and order the lengthening strap if your concerned about the fit . I didn't even need mine so I 'll be using it as a cable tie ( one of many uses for it ) . I 've used it for two full practices and so far no constriction OR slipping issues . Awesome !  
2	  I bought this machine to serve in a small law office and to avoid clutter with separate products . The print function works well and prints quickly . The scan software works seamlessly and the feeder makes quick work of multipage scans . The only complaint would be that the machine is a little slow for the first page to print ( about a 20 second delay ) . Having used many other similar products this one is a good value , easy to setup , easy to use , and is free from the jams and annoyances of most competitors . Recommend it for any home / small office .  
2	  I prefer the standard twist hood mounts , but as the nifty 50 doesn't have one the mechanism this uses is ok . As was already stated it is a bit shallow . The retention buttons annoy me a bit because I tend to squish the hood as I 'm trying to take it off which makes it harder to take off , but they did good for what they had . I do wonder why canon couldn't make an adapter with standard twist instead of this though . 4 stars due to shallowness and the odd mount .  
2	  I 've had this TV for three weeks now and I 'm very happy with it . I went with the small end of the HDTV line because I have a moderately sized apartment and didn't want the set to dominate my living room . The 32 " screen is a nice , modest size and the picture quality is great . Going for 1080p rather than 720p might be overkill at this size , but it 's nice to know I have the sharpest image money can buy and it 'll make a stunning second monitor for my computer . I 'm glad that they put a matte finish on the glass so that there 's much less glare than on my old standard TV . The border is shiny piano black but I haven't been troubled by reflections or fingerprints . I also haven't noticed any problems with uneven backlighting or bad pixels . When watching non-widescreen programs the set will let you choose from black sidebars , stretch , or zoom . I wish it were smart enough to automatically zoom in on letterboxed low-definition shows but it 's easy enough to switch manually . I was surpised at the diversity of input ports : multiple stereo audio jacks , component , composite , S-video , cable , and HDMI . The set will let you rename the inputs on-screen and disable inputs that you don't use . I 'm very pleased with the speakers . The sound quality is quite good and , unlike many sets , the volume covers the entire range from very quiet to blasting with fine control . My old set went from " not quite loud enough " to " annoying loud " with a single press of the volume button . I know that many people hook up external sound systems these days but for my purpose I 'm glad to have good built-in speakers . The remote control is perplexingly big . The buttons are small and widely spaced . There 's also a flip-open compartment with four small buttons inside . Why they didn't just put those buttons on the surface is beyond me .  
1	  In a week and a half , both sides of these are blown . Not a quality product . Should be able to handle my mp3 player 's volume better than my $ 4 headphones , and even my $ 4 headphones arent blown yet !  
2	  What better way to organize the digital photographs you have burned to CD ? I run thumbnails on 5x8 index cards and put them in the front of the sleeve in which each CD is stored . Just listing the filenames takes less space . Now I can find particular subjects or photos without having to slip each CD into the drive or writing all over the CD itself . I also like it for it 's original intent .. to store DVDs compactly . What 's in each album ? I use a commercial labeler ( i.e. P-Touch ) which sticks just fine and helps me organize the various albums .  
1	  I installed the stereo with this harness and thought all was ok until I turned off the car an the stereo kept playing . I had a friend look at it and we tried the harness with another stereo . It did the same thing . I went to bestbuy an bought a different harness and the stereo works fine .  
2	  The pictures I took were as good as the ones I took with the more expensive canon lens . I 'll l recommennd this lens to all my friends amateur photograhers looking to supplement the 18-55 lens that comes standard in Nikon and Canon Cameras .  
1	  I concur with other posters , this HDMI cable quit working after a few months . Had audio , but the video was completely scrambled . Double checked connections , and if cable was " wiggled " just right , the picture would come back . Replaced with another HDMI cable and things work just fine now . In this case , you DO get what you pay for .  
1	  What in the world ? This is titled " Copier toner " but the photo and the description are about a case for notebook computers .. hopefully , someone who can fix the listing will see this note ..  
2	  I 've already used this speaker wire to connect my 7.1 system together , and the sound is great .  
2	  After four months I am convinced this is the finest digital SLR for this price . You can pay more , but why ? I got the D200 with the Nikkor 18-200mm lens . This is Nikon 's best wide angle to telephoto zoom lens and it is the camera 's weakest link . I 'm surprised that Nikon has priced this camera body for just $ 1500 . You will not be disappointed if you purchase this camera .  
2	  After I purchased my macbook pro , I tried going to Best Buy for a case after looking at Target and Staples without any luck . Most of the ones that these stores carry have zippers that snag and scratch the laptop putting it in or taking it out of the case . After picking up a case that was too big ( a 15.4 rather than a 15 because that is all they had ) , I started looking online . A friend suggested Marware because the fit is nice and tight and you feel more secure knowing that this was specially designed for macbooks . I 've had the case for about a month now and no scratches so far .  
2	  I really lazy add comment for any product but I want with this because this backbage so good , I I want to put comment for anybody needs reference before buy this backbage . I have XPS 17 inch , I do research a lot on many sites to find a good quality of backbage , but they are so expensive and not enough space for what I need , then I decide go with this because it has a lot of room . I put my laptop , include AC adapter , mouse , tablet Wacom 9X12 inch , then I put 5 books ( 5 inch thick ) and on top I can put my sanwiches and coke . the rest is my charcoal pencil ( 2 inch deep ) . You can put more but these are too heavy for me . Amazingly that it 's can hanndle these . I really recomment for students who need put a lot of stuff .  
2	  This bag may be only a little bigger than a magazine , but Domke is masters at conserving space . I am able to fit my Pen FT w / lens attached , plus 4 lenses and all the accessories easily . This bag even stands up on its own , probably because of the waxwear finish . First photo bag I 've been completely satisfied with . As others have stated on the other versions , you do need to use 2 hands to open it . The image for it above is terrible , it really looks much better in person , it 's really brown & sand colored .  
1	  Purchased the product in order to run a game system and my cable system through one optical audio input on my receiver . Tried all inputs on the device , tested multiple optical audio cords , never was able to get the signal to pass through the device into my receiver . Only worked directly into the receiver . Would have been good if it worked , but sadly it did not . Returned for a refund , looking for another solution .  
1	  Oh my in the dark the only way to see the clock it hit the light / snooze button and if you live anywhere near an air port well then look out .. When the alarm goes off all the lights come on plus the IPod comes on and if you are turned that way once you recover from being blinded you are able to hit the snooze .. I took mine back to the store . I was not happy about the remote costing another $ 15 either .  
1	  This unit at first pleased me with adequate audio quality and the ability to bypass those unreliable tape cassette adapters which only work in some cassette players . However , after about 30-40 minutes of playback , this unit fails and displays a flashing " J " in the display . If I let it sit for a while , it works again for another 30-40 minutes and then fails again . This failure is both repeatable and seen with a couple of different audio sources . I contacted Monster support via their website 's email form , but there was no response . I guess most people use it less than 30-40 minutes and therefore do not see this issue .  
1	  i recieved this product about a few weeks ago , hooked to my ipod and got barely an audible from it , checked everthing to make sure i was hooking my ipod up properly same response . i will not recoomend this product to anyone else .  
2	  My Polycomms kept burning out so I tried this one - mainly for the speakerphone . Works great so far ( 4 months ) with good sound and controls .  
2	  The keyboard is really convenient . It folds up nicely and can fit in a large pocket . It seems to be able to work with any PDA device with an infrared port on top . But it doesn't quite work as effectively as a normal keyboard , I think because of the infrared connection . I notice that sometimes I 'll hit a button , and nothing appears on the screen . I 'll hit it several times , then finally it appears , and typing becomes easy . It seems to temporarily loses connection , then regain it . Certainly beats typing on the Treo 650 , though !  
2	  This player was a replacement for my 1992 Sony that was quite similar to this one . The 1992 worked well for years and had slowly passed away . The new one works perfectly as I expected . The controls are on a bevel slanted towards the top though and not as easy to see and use as my old Sony . But still a very very good product .  
1	  Never got it to work . I spent 1 hour on my own trying and an additional 45 minutes with tech support . Nothing . Sent it back for refund .  
2	  First off , I 'm a fan of 3-D items in general so when I can get a useful item covered in lenticular vinyl , I 'm in ! The color changing aspects are bright and lively ( I have the red / blue ) and the zipper is plastic with a solid metal zipper pull . I 've filled the sleeves to near capacity and the case doesn't seem overly stuffed . The insert is the standard clear / white fabric backed cd / dvd sleeve , cheapish but fine . Outer case is quite strong and thre zipper well sewn to the casing . I find these great and a friend loved the idea of a dvd library looking so flash . Love ' em !  
1	  Guess what they dont mention ? This product contains the hated RIAA secure digital music initiative ie it wont play all of the . mp3 that you downloaded . Read this quote from news . com " However , not everyone considers such security a step forward . Secure Digital includes software that complies with Secure Digital Music Initiative standards protecting against unauthorized replication of copyrighted content . As a result , digital-audio files downloaded from music services , .. cannot be played on devices that use Secure Digital cards " In short you will only be able to use this with the RIAA approved songs and only as long as you pay the monthly fee . NO THANKS !  
1	  Had the product only 1 month . Worked great until started getting " Wrong Disc " error . Now the thing won't play any DVD 's . Never dropped or exposed to extremes . Stopped working for apparently no reason . This seems like too common a problem based on my quick scan of other reviews on Amazon . Now I 've got to try to get some service from Coby .. doesn't look like others have had good results with their customer service . Be Warned .  
2	  This is a nice little switch . The cost is good . I use this to print to one printer from two compuers . The only con about this switch is that the software is not Vista compatible . I have to manually hit the button on the switch to print back and forth from one computer or the other . I 'm not even sure if you get the software to work that the switch would always be on for both computers to print anytime .  
1	  I purchased these specifically because I wanted a long cord and the description said 8 foot plug . Well I get it and it is only 4 feet long as per package and therefore unusable for my intended purpose . No wonder it has gone down in price if even the description can't be correct ..  
1	  Add me to the list of people who have encountered the dreaded " H07 " error . The unit is slightly over a year old and was lightly used . ( about 2-4 times a month ) Last week , I powered up the unit , put a DVD in , and up comes the error message on the display . THANKFULLY , I was wise and purchased the 3 year extended warranty . Why ? Because my last DVD player , also a Panasonic ( DVD A120 ) , suffered from the infamous laser pickup failure . This is the second machine I 've owned that 's went bad on me , and although my unit was repaired , I will no longer consider another Panasonic product . Over the years , I 've been a faithful customer of Panasonic / Technics , but since around 2000 or so , they have had some serious quality control issues with their products that prevents me from recommending them as a first choice . Although their TV line is still acceptable , I 'd be hesitant to recommend any other Panasonic product . This is inexcusable why these things are suffering from major failures when they are still rather new . Whatever happened to the days when something would last 10-15 years and seldomly ( if ever ) needed repairs ? Are all companies designing products with a short lifespan now ? This is nonsense . I have an old AM / FM console stereo with turntable and 8-track that is STILL working fine after nearly 30 + years of weekly use . What 's going on ? It seems to me that in the electronics field , anything over 3 years old is considered antique , so why not buy a new one since the cost of repairs will likely exceed what the product is worth ? Come on Panasonic , get your act together ! We 're not talking about mass-market junk here , we 're talking brand name products from ( once ) reputable companies . In the past five years alone , I have replaced the following , ( all within 3 years old ) : Zenith TV after two years ( bad picture tube ) Panasonic DVD ( laser pickup failure ) RCA CD changer ( general failure ) Sony Discman ( motor failure ) Technics Receiver ( general failure ) Teac Single-CD player ( laser failure ) Zenith VCR ( piece of junk that never worked right ) JVC double cassette deck ( unrepairable problem ) Pioneer Amplifier ( circuit board failure ) I 'm getting sick of having to go out and buy new A / V equipment almost every other year . No sooner would I get something paid off , then something else would go on me . Maybe I 've just had bad luck , but reading all these other reviews , as well as reviews from other makes / models , really makes me wonder just what is going on . Are they ALL producing junk now ? First it was the dreaded laser failure on Panasonic DVD players , now it seems they are having issues with the tiny DC motor that spins the stupid disc . Oh sure , I called their 1-800 number , but after spending almost 45 minutes on hold and getting bounced around the switchboard between customer service and their technician , I hung up . It was painfully obvious to me that nobody had a clue what I was even talking about . Took it into an authorized service center , and the guy smiled and yelled out to the back room : " another Panasonic player on the fritz " , which leads me to believe that the place must have been FULL of these things . It took nearly a month to get it back , and although Panasonic agreed to honour the warranty , they said that next time they wouldn't pay for it , and to just go out and buy another player . ( which is exactly what they want you to do ) Apparently , the life expectancy of these things is only 2-3 YEARS ? Come on ! As for me , I learned my lesson the hard way . From now on , I 'm not going to purchase anymore " quality , brand-name " products , since they don't seem to hold up any longer than the mass-market Wal-Mart junk does . Buyer beware .  
2	  plug and play with vista . cheap . works . what more can you want .  
2	  I bought this as a 9 " digital picture frame and was disappointed and surprised that it measures only 8 " diagonally . I 'm surprised Amazon doesn't note that in the description . Once I got this thing going , I realized that it was a higher quality product than the other frame I have by Pandigital . Although there is no remote , the controls are very easy to operate and intuitive . Probably the best feature is the ability to make albums on your memory card . I 'm using a 2GB card and have made several albums for dogs , kids , vacation home , family etc . Depending on my mood , I can choose a slide show or still to suit . The internal memory stores about 75 pictures but I find I don't even use that . One of the best features , in my opinion , is the built in rechargeable battery . You can move the frame to different spots or pass it around in a group . As far as I can tell the battery lasts about 1 1/2 hours to 2 hrs when doing slide shows . It gives a five minute warning before the battery is exhausted and recharges in a few hours . This frame will not accept SDHC cards and will not play video . I knew that going in but some might be disappointed . The frame 's appearance is impressive . The brushed aluminum has a very rich modern look to it . As far as I can tell , Philips doesn't say what their resolution is but the picture is bright and sharp . My next frame will also be a Philips since I like the built in battery , the build quality , and the album features . This frame may be a tad pricey but I think the battery adds extra value .  
1	  I purchased the Transend 8GB SDHC Card in the beginning of August . I put it in my digital camera and it seemed to be OK . I didn't need to use the camera until the end of September and when I turn on the camera , I get a card error . Reformatting does not help and since it is past the Amazon 30 day return period , it turns into a throw away . Moral , if you have money to throw away then buy this memory chip from Amazon .  
1	  This keyboard folds out well and I liked the feel of the keys . However , the IR connector needs to be in direct connection with the IR port in the PDA . For the iPaq , this port is at the bottom of the handheld . The 210 degree arm does not rotate to this area . In order to have the proper connectivity , you have to turn the handheld on its side . This then requires another software program download ( not freeware that I can find ) to rotate your screen to the landscape view , unless you can read sideways without getting a headache . Before buying this product , check your handheld to see if your IR port is between 4-8 o'clock - if so , this may be a difficult keyboard to use .  
2	  I already had a printer and got this mainly because I was tired of using a magic marker to scrawl titles on my CD compilations . I am very impressed with how easy it is to print the CDs and what a good job the printer does . The CD printing software is easy to use . It comes with some insipid designs , but you can use your own images as background ( and lighten them if you want ) on the CD . You can also place your own images on the CD , not as background . The lettering ( provide it 's a single line ) has an " auto-arch " option that keeps it concentric with the CD as you move it away from the center . The only drawback I 've found is that it doesn't have a neat way of entering the track titles . Excellent capability at a good price .  
1	  I was impressed with the charger for about 1 month-than it stopped charging the NiMh batteries it came with . I took it back to Best Buy only to find that ALL of the Rapid Chargers on thier shelf did not work either . A sales person and I tested them all , hoping I would be able to exchange my broken one with one that worked . It was more disappointing after calling Kodak - they were unable to replace it or get my money back . I thought purchasing a Kodak was a smart decision , however , they did not stand behind their product which was very disappointing .  
2	  I bought this binocular for music concerts . The foucus is clear and the eye fatigue for long time use is minimal . A good binocular for me .  
2	  start up programing went well but when i tried customize setting , i found instructions confusing . this was very frustrating , but when i contacted tech help they were very helpful and helped me correct my errors with the remote hooked up to the computer . tech support was outstanding and the remote works great .  
2	  This printer was a .. bargain for me after .. rebate ( which I still HOPE to receive ) . It is loud , but I don't live in a museum or a library so I don't really care . It takes a while to heat up after sitting idle when you need to print - how often do you need to print any way ? The speed of this puppy is mind boggling , and I 'm spoiled by network printers ( albeit now Xerox network printers instead of HP at work ) . No USB cable comes w / it , but check out your local Costco / Price Club . They sell a sweet USB cable 3-pack .. P>My only complaint is that you can only get one perfectly aligned print-out at a time . It is not a very significant skew - you don't lose data off the page - but it is noticeable . Most of my output consists of maps and directions , which are for my own use and have a short shelf life anyway . However , if you plan to turn this output over to a customer , think twice . I WILL say that I can get a single perfectly aligned print-out when I press the paper in the tray down until the paper tensioner locks . I had a certificate to print out and it came out perfectly . I would also like to mention that the envelope feeder ate my 1st envelope for lunch . The second went through OK but the radius of the drum is so small that ( along w / the heat from the fuser ) you end up with a somewhat " distressed " looking envelope . Again , I don't think you 'd want to pass this to a customer ( at least not a paying one ) , but for personal use - and that 's what this printer is for , eh ? - the printer works fine  
2	  You will find these headphone extremely pleasing . And I will not say that they are as good as the amount of money you pay for them . They are better than $ 20-$25 that you will pay for them . In my opinion , these are very good headphones . They produce decent amount of bass and over all sound quality and volume is perfect . I have come to love these headphones in the last month that I have used them . The cushion for ears is deep and soft ( be aware , not as soft as Sony 's that cost more ) and suitable for longer hours of wearing . I am not sure how other headphones are but these will get you around 5 hours before your ears start to pain . I have very happy with these headphones .  
1	  The card has a transfer rate of 54Mbps with a Linksys WRT610 router . Not impressed . The card gets very hot and loses the wireless connection . I went back to my internal card on my Dell Inspiron 1501 . Waste of money .  
1	  After reading all the glowing reviews about the great sound , I ordered this as opposed to the JBL , figuring the only thing that 's missing is remote control . The sound quality is nothing to write home about . It turns out that there are no miracles , and you get what you pay for . If you 're looking for an inexpensive dock that sounds better than a clock radio , but not by much , then get this . But don't think you 'll be able to use this to provide music at a party , unless it 's in a nursing home .  
1	  I detest this printer . I 've bought quite a few printers in my day : Lexmark , Canon , and have been quite happy with most HP 's , but this was the pits . The first one I brought home worked fine the first time but when I tried to turn it on the next day , it wouldn't cut on . It just died on me . I unplugged it , plugged it back it .. then it worked for a little while before dying again . This time for good . I returned it , got another one .. same problem . Except this time it keeps going . All I have to do is unplug it before each and every time I turn it on . Nice , huh ? Now I 'm browsing online again and I 've learned my lesson for sure . No more el cheapo models . I 'm at least going to shell out for a midline price with some heft to it that will last me a year or two .  
2	  Considering that my camera came with a lens that has almost the same focal length ( my kit lens is the EFS 18-55 3.5-5.6 IS ) , I was wondering if this lens was really worth the shocking price . It took all of one afternoon to convince me just how much better this lens is . I still think that the lens is on the pricey side , but performance wise this is an L lens . Images are stunningly sharp , and colors are fantastic . Wide open it produces beautiful bokeh , and because it is a fast lens you can use it indoors as well as out-doors . Since the 17-55 mm range ( since it only can be used on a 1.6 FOV body , it 's actually a 27-88 mm lens ) covers my favorite focal length ( 35-50mm ) it is my favorite walk-about lens . Wide-angle shots ( especially inside buildings ) are handled equally well as portraits by this lens . Compared to my kit lens - well , there really is no comparison . The fixed 2.8 aperture through the whole focal range alone puts the kit lens to shame . Mounted on a 450D this lens produces a nicely balanced composition that is easy to handle . AF is quick and silent , and the image stabilisator helps to steady those shots that otherwise would require a larger aperture . As with the kit lens , it can't do miracles , though , as too many marginal pictures unfortunately prove ( I should have upped the ISO on those ) . The much larger ( compared to the kit lens ) body is easier to operate , and frankly , also looks better . The 77mm filter thread may be an annoyance to you if you don't have any other lens with that size , as you have to purchase new filters and can't share them with other lenses ( most of my other lenses , not being L type , have 58mm threads ) . Although the barrel extends with zoom , it does not turn during zooming , nor during focusing . This helps a lot when you are shooting outdoors with a circular pol filter and have to get the right focal length fast . Although the lens has a nice weight ( 650g ) , I am a bit disappointed that the barrel is made from plastic instead of metal - I would expect that a lens with this price tag would have a quality feel to match . The plastic does feel a bit cheap . I 'm also disappointed that this lens did not come with a lens hood . Again , at that price I would expect these things to be included . When deciding to purchase this lens it is important to also consider the fact that this lens is an ' EF-S ' type and will only work on 1.6FOV cameras , not on full frame bodies . It will therefore stay with your 1.6 should you get a full body later . Personally , I think it is an excellent lens , and I happily recommend it to anyone who shoots in the same focal range .  
1	  It 's a good thing this card was so inexpensive because it worked for all of 12 hours before failing . We lost all the pictures taken during that time because of this shotty memory card . I 'm very disappointed .  
2	  The Ultimate Ear Triple-Fi headphones are simply the best . I am an audio junkie . I always used Bose speakers and headphones . I kept a good pair of Sony in-ear headphones for walking around , etc . A year ago , I purchased Shure SE210 , they were so good , I returned them and upgraded to the SE310 and they were awesome . ( For Christmas I was given the Bose in-ear headphones and did not like the fit or the sound . ) I was so happy with the Sure $ 200 + headphones , I could not image that anything could sound as good . Then , I tried the Ultimate Ear Triple-fi . I was terrified of the price . It was like listening to tracks for the first time . There are nuances , sounds , instruments , echos , I never heard before . And I consider myself a very discriminating and detailed listener . It was worth the money .  
2	  I ordered these binoculars through Amazon . com on 7/21/11 and they were at my door at 7/23/11 . Great service , Amazon ! I have tried them out and they are excellent and just what I needed . Clear , compact , excellent quality . I highly recommend .  
1	  I got the unit to use on my Canon T2i DSLR , it fit nicely and the construction is fine as was the range but the sound is vary poor . The noise floor is high ( it has a noticeable hiss ) and the sound transmitted is two quiet as well as seeming muffled . I tried some high end headset and lapel mics with the transmitter and the sound was still bad . Now I just need to save $ 600 for a sennheiser .  
2	  I recently passed a kidney stone and my doctor informed me that I had to drink more water . I fill this every morning from the refrigerator and take it to work with me . It keeps the water cool all day long , and it helps me measure my intake . I know I have to finish the water in the bottle before I got to bed that night . The handle makes it easy to carry and it is very good quality .  
2	  Works out really well , the construction is pretty neat how it folds out . i dont even know how it turns on and off , it think when ever its open its on , and whenever its closed it turns off . Works as decribed , although im having some trouble with the Drive on My TXthe function keys wont navigate to applications in full screen for some reason . Still , works well as a keyboard .  
2	  With out a doubt , Faster , Lighter , Tougher , and a whole heck of a lot more powerfull . Superbly crisp screen , I was very impressed with the Visor Neo , and it 's proven Palm OS it 's faster than ever . You can even do a one button hot sink over your network . I Give this product an A + , 100 % , two thumbs up , and extra ccredit too !  
2	  The Tamrac Adventure 7 Photo pack worked really great for what what I bought it for . I used to have my 20D with a 17-85 in a padded pellican box strapped to the back of the luggage rack on my snowmobile , but it was still taking a beating with all the shaking . I usually wear a back pack anyway , so this replaced the one I was wearing and it held my camera nicely . I like the fact that I can get to my camera very quickly even if the pack is on someone elses back . There is room for a couple of photo cards , batteries , filters ect .. in lower front pouch . I don't have a 70-200 yet , but some people say it will barely fit in the pack . The upper compartment is large enough to fit two light jackets or wind breakers or one medium jacket . For the price it was a good buy . I don't like a lot on my back when I 'm doing active things . This was just the right size .  
1	  It is broken when I got it . It cannot received some TV channels . but price is cheap . Design is good for small TV .  
2	  I just received my Canon Powershot S50 and this printer . The pictures are awesome . They are clear like photos and they print very quickly . I was able to set it up myself , which means it was very easy !  
2	  I don't want to spend too much time on my review because it probably won't be read . I have recently bought these headphones for 31 dollars here on amazon and I 'd say they are a steal . They can be comfortable but you 'll first have to tinker with them for a while to get them just right . I strongly recommend you DON'T put the upper pad directly on your temple ( you will feel extreme discomfort ) , instead put them slightly behind or above your temple ( you are welcome for saving you a lot time . ) The sound quality is very good . I bought these after my Bose around-ear headphones broke after only a year . I 've concluded these koss have almost the same quality , but they still do not have the amazing clarity as the 130 $ Bose . They have a wide range of sound and responsive and superb bass . I listen to a especially wide range of music ( From Black Metal to Intelligent Dance Music ( IDM ) ) and these definitely preform . BUY THEM !  
2	  This was a very nice case for the money . I read other reviews and one said a 15.4 " laptop fit like a glove so I thought I 'd give it a try . Unfortunately , it did not work out in my favor and I had to send the bag back . I have an HP zv6000 ( 15.4 " widescreen ) and there was no way of making it fit .  
2	  Chips were easy to install . Arrived quickly . Good for boosting speed in my 6 year old Dell Dimension . Price and convenience also a plus .  
2	  This is my second d link and works great . Tried a different brand through Amazon and took it back within a week and went back to D link just upgraded to this router love it best in towm  
2	  At twice the price it would be hard to imagine being able to match this piece of equipment . It is simple to operate , and scans photos , slides , and negatives with great detail and precision . It comes with excellent software , including Photoshop Elements ( v . 4 ) , and Photo Sudio 5.5 . This was a great upgrade at a bargain price .  
2	  Just purchased this at Frys for $ 25 , my second set after 4 years , used for workouts , has held up well .  
1	  I purchased this drive from Amazon . It lasted a little over a year , then died . Since I had been using Western Digital drives exclusively since I started building computers in the late 1990s , I assumed that this was a fluke , and I purchased and installed another one , same model as the one that died . The second one lasted a year and a month before it also died . That 's it for me - one failure could be a fluke , but two virtually identical failures is a design and / or quality problem . I am now through with Western Digital . Something has apparently changed , and not for the better . If you do buy this drive , you better be very sure that your data is backed up somewhere else ..  
2	  Decent product . Some things are a tad misleading . For example ; the power button can only be used as a power button when using the " Activities " macros and not when addressing a specific component ( Like , if I select TV to use that profile for my TV , the power button is not programmable or usable . It can only power cycle the TV once I do something like " Watch TV " in the Activities macro , and then it will power off all components used in that macro - my receiver , monitor , and DVR ) . Aside from that , not a bad little unit . It even works with my Mac Mini . RF ONLY !  
2	  it arrived with in 3 days and the price was unbeatible , great printer !  
1	  I recently received my Coby player and found some things that were not very well thought out in the overall design . Here are the Pro 's and cons that I found . Cons : 1 . DVD load mechanism . This is a significant flaw as it does not allow you to easily load a DVD when vehicle mounted . The mechanism requires that you remove it from the holder , open it up , put in the DVD , close it then re-insert it into the holder . Very poor design that is a royal pain to change DVDs if the car is moving . 2 . Manual AV / DVD switch . On the left side of the unit is the sliding switch which turns on the player to one of two modes , DVD or AV . The manufacturer should have gone with an electronic switch vice a manual switch as it is not easy to ensure you have the DVD mode since it is in the center of the selection slide and there is no audible or ' feelable ' indication that you have it in the correct position . This becomes more inconvenient when you are sliding the player in or out of the holder . Pros . 1 . Good picture quality . The picture is clear and easy to see . 2 . Sound control easy to use . Spinning wheel sound control is easy to adjust . 3 . Compact slim design . Overall design is especially well suited for vehicle mounting and allows the player to sit flat against the back of the headrest . This keeps it from being kicked or jostled if you have a toddler in a car seat . The fold out one I had was prone to being kicked by my 3 year old . Overall the player is a good buy for the money but I couldn't rate it higher as the two design flaws are significant in detracting from its ease of use .  
2	  This animal is older than the hills . It actually came with Windows Vista . I only bout the critter for something to use while having another system updated . The selling point was being able to see the 15 inch screen which was a good size for the time . This wireless " g " is still in the main stream today and wireless N devices also accept it . I have recently updated the ram form two . 5GB to two 2GB sticks . The system recounted the update immediately . The system came with a restore partition but I never trust them and have external disks in case of a virus or anything physical . I also updated to Windows 7 and anticipate trying Windows 8 . Just a note that unless you are ept and can adjust to the exterenal wrld without help from the manufaturer this may not be the best way to go . Personally I find the challenge fun .  
1	  The sound these speakers put out is pretty decent for the price , though nothing special . The real problem , however , is feedback . Not only are there loud pops and clicks , but they constantly pick up radio frequencies . As long as the speakers are on and the volume is low , you will hear various radio broadcasts in myriad languages ( sometimes more than one at a time ) , and if you turn the volume up to avoid this , you get the pops and clicks . The voices made me curious at first , then it was kind of amusing . Now it 's flat out annoying . This seems to be a frequent problem with Logitech speakers in general , not just this model . The Mp3 player dock is certainly nice , but does not outweigh the annoyance of the incessant feedback . Even for such a low price , these speakers are not worth it .  
2	  Simple to use and simple to organize pics . 3 megapixels is plenty i have no need for anything larger than 8 1/2 by 10 . I love the media  
2	  i have this amp hooked up to four pyramid hyper pro subwoofers , 2 12s and 2 10s , and boy does this thing slam , i only had the volume on 12 and the rear view mirror was shaking like crazy ! i would reccomend this product to anyone ! KEEP IT UP PYRAMID !  
1	  Very frustrated . After only the 3rd use , the speaker system completely shut down . I 've tried everything and even had some techy friends try and figure it out . Of course the original boxes and packaging are long gone in the trash . The speakers and receiver are soon to follow . Complete waste of money .  
1	  I got this play and charge kit but in the end I regret it . While the battery was good and would hold a charge , thwe wire would make a buzzing noise everytime i plugged it in . Never will buy from this seller again  
2	  The Cannon rebel digital Slr is the best ! I searched all over the net and found nothing that compared to the price of this camera . I have a Rebel film SLR and a Cannon digital Video mini DV Z65 . So yes I am loyal to Cannon because they make great products .  
2	  In terms of price for the feature-set included with this remote , I don't think you can find a better deal . I 've had the Logitech 880 running my home theater for over a year now and couldn't be happier , but I needed another remote for my bedroom .. the 550 was perfect for it , as I had only a few devices I wanted to control ( including my fan ! ) . For those who are tired of managing multiple remotes ( TV , DVR , Cable Box , DVD Player , etc . ) this line of remotes truly does the job . These are easily configured via an included application , taking only minutes to program your devices exactly how you want ( just know beforehand the model number of your devices , and what devices are on which TV / receiver inputs and you won't even have to leave the computer ) . Basically , if my wife can work my complicated theater set-up with these remotes , anyone can ( my mother really liked them too when she was house sitting ) .  
2	  This device is GREAT ! I'ts probly the best iPod out there now since the mini was replaced by the crappy nano . There 's fun games ( for an iPod ) , there 's a world clock , it looks B E A U T I F U L , and it 's inexpensive . Now it does scrach very easly but it holds a lot of songs . Sure it is a little heavy but it is very un-breakable . But that person that said that " apple cares " is an oxy moron , then why the Hell would they make this iPod so Unbelieveable ? ! Good job Apple . Good job .  
1	  Looks good but doesnt keep a charge more than a couple of hours . might be good for a childs first in case they loose it or mistreat it but If a serious music listener , may want to spend the $ TO GET IT NEW .  
1	  The winding case is completely useless .. It looks fancy , but after the first few times , winding becomes irritating . The sponge caps keep coming out . They do not fit the ear phones properly . And I already loast mine , just after owning it for 5 weeks . The same thing happened with my two other friends who bought the same earphones . Now I am using them without sponge caps .. irritating !  
2	  just what i wanted i do music production and i needed a trackball mouse that would definately speed u my workflow and this was it , had for over a year now and its still going , i would definately buy this item again .  
2	  My G9 with the RRS L-Plate fits nicely into the PSC-5000 and the camera seems pretty well protected . As others have mentioned there is not enough room in the case for a backup battery but it does include a small leather attachable pocket for a spare battery and memory card . If your camera has a neck strap then the case and camera can be carried around your neck or over your shoulder ( Or if you prefer a belt can be used . ) All that being said , a better alternative is the Canon Soft Case SC-DC55A . However it is a more expensive " custom " carrying case .  
1	  Returned it because the video image quality was poor on one of my PCs . I could not get the same image quality using the KVM , compared with straight cable , even after updating all drivers . IOGear customer support could not resolve the problem either and recommended returning it for another unit . The problem may be with my video card or hardware , but my old PS-2 Linksys KVM did not have any problems with the same hardware . I switched back to my old PS-2 Linksys KVM , with excellent image quality , until I find a USB KVM that works with my hardware .  
1	  I 'm a Photojournalist in Mexico , in my work borrow me a Mk IIN but the battery who came with the camera it was too old and lose the charge too fast . I think in buy one but here in Mexico are too expensive like 200 dlls or more and it 's impossible find a gereric . I order this item whit my family in usa , then they send me this to my house in mexico . i put to charge in my original canon charger and when i disconect one of the tiny tubes who came in the contact space broke 's and fall , the charger not charge de battery anymore , i try to fix it whit a cuprum litle tube for make contact and doesn't worki loose my mind and broke the battery ..  
1	  This notebook cooler did not do much to cool down my laptop . I am very disappointed with this purchase . The fan was pretty quiet during the first month of having it , but soon it collected a lot of dust and began making loud whirring noises . I would NOT recommend this product !  
1	  HD-515 is an entry-level headphone to 500 series . It however fails its promise . the sound quality ( especially the base is nasal ) is not good over all . Being a 500 it has a design that makes it comfortable but the question you ask is that why is it so big in the first place ? Even though I had reviews on it I 'm of the opinion that for the less price you could get more or less the same quality . However hd-515 's sisters are very different on the matters of quality . I do recommend buying one of its sisters hd-555 or hd-595 , instead . If those are too expensive I would suggest buying hd-280 pro for just a little more . Note that when you 're reading reviews on headphones it is subjective for a great part . I will have to explain what my taste is before giving a review to hd-515 . I like my headphones to be comfortable using it for hours in a row . 500 series have a good way of offering a design that assures a high level of comfort . I also wanted noise cancellation in the beginning when I bought my hd-280 pro . It doesn't really have noise cancellation but it is a sealed headphone . It means that blocks noise in virtue of sealing the area around your ears . I have found out ( I might be wrong but in my experience ) that noise cancellation works best for people around you and not you . It is not the case that just by putting one the headphones the noises inside would block all the noises outside - but that in high volumes you are surely to hear just your own sound ( not your heart beat or your breathing but the sound generated by the headphone . Sealed headphones generally do the same thing ( just put cups or your hands around your ears and you wouldn't hear sounds outside as well ! ) . However that all comes at a cost . Sealed headphones are generally speaking lower in quality . Noise blocking works best for non-listeners unless the volume level is high . So if people around you have no problem with buzz sound of your music ( " privacy " they call it ) then go for open headphones . I wouldn't want to buy something that blocks the sound for the convenience of others ! So I would buy open headphones and get advantage of better sound quality . Yet open does not mean that you can hear everything outside your cans and doesn't mean others could sit around you and listen ! My first headphones were sennheiser hd-280 pro a sealed headphones that are not very uncomfortable . I traded in because they weren't comfortable ( and for mysterious reasons my ears were hurting ) . I didn't get a chance to burn the headphones and sold it as soon as I could - headphones are like cars . You need to use it for a while to get a good sound and break it in so to speak . So don't be too disappointed in the beginning . I sold those headphones to my neighbor and he couldn't be happier . As I have said it is very subjective why some people like their headphones . I know that he is a gamer and his last headphone was broken . Other than that he has no preference on the comfortableness of the headphones . He had worn those for hours without any discomfort . Currently I have put an order for HD 595 . I will write a very short review once I receive it .  
2	  The only reason I couldn't give this product 5 stars is because it doesn't charge my iPod ( 3rd generation ) .. but the sound quality is awesome , it 's SO easy to use and when I wrote to the company to ask about the fact that it wasn't charging my iPod .. I got a very fast and personal reply . They helped me determine which iPod I have , explained to me in detail why it didn't work and offered to send me a model that will work for my iPod after I ship mine back . They have outstanding customer service ! And when I get the new poduct I will be sure to write a review for that one as well ! If you have anything other than a 3rd generation iPod - this is a great thing to own .. and while I didn't get to try it out .. it says you can use it with any audio device with a standard output jack .. AND you can charge your cell phone if it 's USB chargable ! BONUS ! :) I highly recommend this !  
1	  I bought this item to add a phone jack for my Dish Network DVR . The house I just moved into does not have a jack anywhere near the DVR , and I don't have the ability to install one . Setup was very quick , and I thought things were going to be good , but after about 30 seconds on a voice call , I found that this unit causes a lot of noise on the other phones in the house that are not connected to it . Very disappointed with it .  
2	  This is my 3rd Domke Bag . Although I did not need this new F2 , I simple wanted it for the limitted color choice of grey . This bag is awesome ! Color is a combo of old skool n new skool . I can carry my 7d with 10-22 attached , 17-55f2.8 , 70-200L is ii F2.8 , 580ex ii , and lots of little gadgets . Very easy to get in-n-out of for quick working . I would not consider any other bag .  
1	  The best thing about the PSA250 is the excellent build quality - durable metallic casing and rubberized buttons - much better than the cheap plastic most other MP3 players are made of . It also has a built in rechargeable battery ( lithium , I think ) , which is nice . FM radio , bass boost and strobe light are all great features as well . Unfortunately , the software interface is so horrible as to be nearly unusable . Seems like Nike / Philips spent all their R & D; money on external construction then slapped together some truly slipshod software as an afterthought . While XP does recognize it as a removable flash drive ( meaning you * can * drag and drop MP3 's directly onto the unit via Windows Explorer ) , the PSA250 does not natively read the MP3 format . Ironically , the PSA250 is an MP3 player that does not play MP3 's . You have to load your MP3 's using the Nike / Philips Digtal Media Manager ( DMM ) program that , uninvited , loads itself into the background every time you boot up , hogging system resources and aggravating people like me who hate software bloat slowing down their computer . DMM starts by creating a database of all the MP3 's on your computer ( takes a long time if you have gigs of music like I do ) , then translates your MP3 's into a proprietary format that the PSA250 can recognize . Also , the software only reads embedded IDv3 information , not filenames , which means it will probably report many of your MP3 's as " No Title Found " if you ripped them from CD 's you own . This all turns out to be a very long and frustrating process , especially when all you want to do is add a couple songs to your playlist before going on a morning run . The DMM interface is also ugly , with none of the style of the PSA250 itself . I 'm no engineer , but I do custom system building and am no stranger to working with various electronic devices , from Pocket PC to configuring complex wireless networks . Even for me , using the DMM software has been such an upsetting experience that I simply leave the PSA250 sitting on a shelf gathering dust while I go running in silence . The crazy thing is that if Nike / Philips had just made the PSA250 to read and play MP3 's natively , there wouldn't be any need for a separate software interface and you 'd have one heck of a product . This seems to be a problem with many other Nike / Philips products . The PSA250 looks and feels great , but spend your money on something you will actually use .  
1	  I bought a pack of 110 of these CDs .. about a third of them were defective . The problems I 've had include : the CD writer couldn't write to themaudio cds wouldn't play in a stereo that can play cdr'sdata cd 's couldn't be read on cdrom drivesI 've used 2 different buners and still have the same results . buring software : nero 5.5 + burners : pletor plexwriter 12/10/32 & the crdw / dvd combo drive in sony vaio laptops .  
1	  The overwhelming 5 star reviews is what helped me decide to choose this trimmer . But it 's so not worth the price . It does work on trimming hair that is more than a quarter of an inch , but if you are looking for a closer trim - this item is not for you . Positives - its sleek , and very quiet .  
1	  Do NOT buy this drive . Western Digital My Book is unreliable . I 've had two of these drives , and they both died after a few months of very light use . In both cases , the drive suddenly started making the infamous clicking sound of death , and all the data was lost .  
2	  a little daunting at first , but easy to use , very accurate and so far long battery life . would definitely recommend it .  
1	  I bought 2 pairs of these headphones as the reviews sounded great overall . I have not had a problem with my 8-year-old daughter 's headphones , but my 5-year-old daughter 's headphones broke within about a month of using them . One side still works but the other side does not . You can wiggle the cord just right sometimes & get the nonworking side to work at times but this is rare . I agree with reviewers who state that the cords are too thin . They do not hold up to a small child . I will purchase different headphones next time .  
1	  Pros : - the packaging-was clean out of the box-perfectly fit my 50mm 1.8 af-sCons : - produces ghosting when pointed at lights , this is unacceptable and the reason I give this product 1 star  
1	  I 'm done with LaCie drives . The power bricks are the Achilles heel of Lacie peripherals . I 've had 2 hard drives and 2 optical drives at home . The power bricks have all failed within 3 years . At work we have a backup server with 6 Lacie 1TB drives . We have gone through a dozen or two power bricks . Every time one goes bad the drive unmounts or has errors and the server hangs . That is totally unacceptable in a mission critical system . Sometimes the drives get data corruption when the power supplies fail . I would advise everybody to avoid Lacie products like the plague , unless you can find a more reliable power source . Their products look cool but power bricks are low rent . A proper drive has a built in supply and an IEC power cord . Not a cheap power brick . I 'm spending the extra money for Glyph drives in places I can't afford frequent failures .  
2	  This case is great ! It protects the whole iPod without scratching it . The wheel protector is awsome . It 's touch sensitive and works perfect . It comes with everything you need to protect your iPod ; screen protector , optional belt clip , optional neck lanyard , and optional armband . The only problem is that the screen protector keeps shifting around and the cutout is not approximate . I just use plastic film to protect the screen . Other than that , the case is a great one , and it 's worth the money .  
1	  Sorry to pan these ' cause they sound great and look good but they aren't waterproof and that is unacceptable . I bought a pair three years ago and two more pairs a year later . After the first summer , that 's only 5 months outside , one was full of water . After the second summer another was flooded . Both were replaced by Polk but only after a real struggle . This in spite of registering my purchases with them as required . This fall , when I brought them in , two more were full of water . I 'm really discouraged as I thought they sounded great . That isn't worth anything if the product is defective and customer service stinks . The serial # s of these units range from 90000 to 130000 so I didn't just get a bad run . Might be ok for Phoenix but useless anywhere it rains . H  
2	  My husband has ringing in his ears , it helps to have the TV on most of the time , plus he can't hear too well so its loud . It just drives me crazy . I didn't want to complain , its not his fault . One night I was so annoyed , I went into computor typing , my husband listens to TV too loud . TV ears came up . After lots of research , I ordered . Folks , I gotta tell you MY husband loves them and so do I. I can mute the TV and he can hear it as loud as he wants . He also can hear every word thats said . For that reason I may order some for me .  
1	  I bought this headset to use primarily for home schooling children for interactive educational software . The quality seems very good and they are packed with features . When they work , the sound is excellent , and the microphone works well too ( when it works . ) Unfortunately , it is 9 months now since a preliminary , very buggy driver was released for Windows Vista , and still no update . Windows tries to run the software for this as " legacy " software , but does not do well . I think I would give this a five star for how well it is made , but it only works about 20 % of the time in Windows Vista , so I give it a two . Tritton obviously does not care about selling this to Vista users , or many of us wouldn't be having these problems . What a disappointment . Maybe in a year or two they 'll have a working Vista driver , but by then we 'll probably have another version of Windows . Shame on you Tritton for not keeping your drivers updated on such a narrow range of products you sell .  
1	  This is a great machine when it is working , however , we have had a problem with reliability . Our first machine worked around a month , then stopped cold . It did display an error code which the support person we dealt with was unfamiliar with . They exchanged the unit and about 8 days later we received a new unit . The new unit never successfully fed a sheet of paper ( jammed every time ) , and after the usual trouble shooting with technical support , this unit was also returned . 5 days later and now we have received a third unit which after 2 days appears to be working . The support was OK , with prompt swaps of non-working machines . After the second failed machine I put in for a refund as I was concerned about future reliability of a machine receiving critical faxes , but this was denied . Hope others have more luck with this unit .  
2	  Just as spec 'd , this battery is a direct replacement for the Uniden battery , the connector is a perfect fit , and it 's a fraction of the price from any other source . You can't beat this deal !  
1	  I had this amp for 2 years and replaced it very recently with the Onkyo 9555 . The Onkyo is 500 $ , but what a world of difference . If you really want great sound spend the extra money and get the Onkyo amp ! I would not recommend this amp . The only thing going for it is that it 's cheap .  
2	  At first , I wasn't happy with the sound quality because it is totally different from the other products .. after a week .. I cannot get enough . The best product that I 've purchased ever . It feels like I have a Home theather system on my ears .. Strongly recommend it .. just be sure to use them for a week ;-)  
2	  Great speaker . The sound is as good as any hard-wired unit . I purchased two speakers , but found one was sufficient since we live relatively close to our neighbors and everyone is outside in the evening hours . I sold the other one to one of my neighbors when they heard the sound quality . Easy to set up .  
2	  I have been relatively happy with the Fuji FinePix F20 . It takes pretty darn good pictures , especially in low light . I don't have anything to add about the camera 's features that haven't been posted already , but I can give you a heads up on how they honor their warranties . About 6 months ago , my lens got stuck and the lens cover came off . No big deal . The camera still worked . Then , about a month ago it went completely dead . No big deal , I 'm still under warranty . I went by the book , called for an RMA , and sent it in to their Edison , NJ repair center . About two weeks later I got a bill for over 75 % the cost of replacing the camera . The estimate description reeks of a company trying to sidestep their warranty obligations . So , I call them . I soon reach the typical I Deal With Angry People On The Phone All Day Every Day rep , and end up in one of those conversations where you are presumed guilty before you 're even heard . Eventually , I am put on hold , and in the meantime apparently " the manager " has decided to give me leniency and cut the repair bill down to about 50 % the cost of replacing the camera [ mind you I never spoke to " the manager " and quite frankly if I were to find out it was one of those Seinfeld conversations where you 're put on hold for a few minutes while someone has a fake conversation with " the manager " I wouldn't be the least bit surprised ] . Some things to bear in mind , 1 . I am a lifelong photography hobbyist , and did not abuse this camera in any way2 . I packed it six ways from Sunday so that there could be no disputes with the USPS3 . I was the only one using the camera , so I know that it didn't happen into the wrong hands when the defect occurred . 4 . IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY ! I like Fuji 's cameras , despite the stupid xD cards and I have enjoyed owning this camera . I don't know if any of the other manufacturers are any better about honoring their warranties , but HELL wouldn't it be refreshing if a company simply honored their warranty without argument or question ? There are companies out there who do that . Fuji is categorically NOT one of them . I am not exaggerating when I state that I will not buy another Fuji camera EVER , simply on account of this experience . In fact , I am in the market for a digital camera as a gift this holiday season , and I will go with Canon or Sony or anybody else . They might be just as bad , but now it 's personal .  
1	  I found out that the product you buy here ( great by the way ) is without the clip board and comes with old batteries . It was impossible to get service from this dealer . In the company 's site there are also extra refills , pens and batteries and the service was great .  
2	  first off . i love these headphones . and i also love amazon especially since i am an amazon prime and amazon visa user . but for a product like this , i would recommend buying it at a bestbuy and buying the extended warranty there . so you can just walk in and get replacements . i run quite often and these headphones can only take so much . best running headphones IMO . the nike ( made by philips ) version of these types of headphones is quite similiar . but from personal experience ( and other people 's experiences ) , i 've had the actual headphones ( attached to my iphone ) shock me while i 'm running . so i would recommend these over the nike ones . 4 stars only because they are so fragile  
1	  I bought these because I was in need of a pair of good quality headphones , with good longevity , to wear while I study for finals . I paid 93.08 cents after taxes for these . The sound quality is what i expected , but the construction of these feel incredibly cheap . I will be returning them in a few days , and ordering a pair of krk kns-6400 or 8400 .  
2	  This is a great little TV that seems to do everything well . The picture is pretty darned good as LCDs go-it is very brilliant and crisp , although in common with all LCD screens that I 've seen it sometimes is less-than-perfect for dark scenes . The built-in speakers are mostly OK , although you in my opinion the set benefits significantly if you use bigger outboard speakers . This is a great choice for limited space applications . I installed mine in my boat , and I love it ! The kids love it ! We use ours mainly to watch DVDs , and it is great for this . Panasonic quality is a joy to behold , and this TV hits the mark . Recommended .  
1	  The red and black wire that are advertised as 8gage are not really 8 gage . Do not use this with a 1000 watt amp unless you want your car to catch fire .  
2	  I recieved my HDMI Cable promptly , and upon close examination of the product , find that it bears the " 1.3 " designation . A check of the CURRENT specs shows that the " 1.3 Cable " is capable of handling everything EXCEPT " Updated list of CEC Commands " . The 1.3 version will support Blu-Ray , Dolby Sound , and almost every concievable combination of HDTV and A-V components . HDMI Cable Versions 1.3 ( a ) , 1.3 ( b ) , or 1.3 ( c ) are required for the " CEC Commands " mode . ( Consult your HDTV 's Owner 's Manual for the " CEC Commands " info ) . The bargain-priced 1.3 version cable is PERFECT for my needs ( Samsung 52LNA650 LCD HDTV to Blu Ray ) . I will be buying a HDMI version 1.3b cable for the connection to my HDTV Cable Box to get the " CEC Commands " feature that 's built into the Samsung - from Amazon . com , of course !  
1	  While this CD / radio / clock has some very attractive features , the sound is absolutely awful . It sounds as if the speakers are under water , or , if you 've ever had one of those old 9-volt transistor radios , like the bass is turned all the way up and the treble turned off . CDs and FM radio sound muddy and distorted and AM news / talk is mostly unintelligible . Since there 's no way to tweak any settings to make it listen-able , i 've returned the Philips and replaced it with a Sony Dream Machine . The Sony takes up more space and looks like a dopey version of a flying saucer , but it sounds terrific . The Phillips has some features i really like that the Sony doesn't , but ultimately , if it doesn't sound good it 's not useable . You 'd think that if you were making something to play music , the sound would be a primary concern , but apparently not in this case . That 's regrettable .  
1	  It 's a comfortable , split keyboard with quiet keys . Having said that the space key is incredibly loud , so as you are typing it sounds like ' zz CLACK zz CLACK CLACK zz CLACK zz CLACK CLACK zz CLACK z CLACK zz zz zz CLACK ' It sounds like a typewriter . Now some people are fetishistic about mechanical keyboards and this is not one of them , but it sure sounds like one ! This one detail of LOUD SPACE KEY is a problem . And the likelihood of this being a lemon keyboard is low - I went to our biz 's IT dept and they had other microsoft natural keyboard 4000 's with exactly the same problem . Now here 's the kicker - I 'm part deaf , so you can imagine how my using this keyboard is frustrating to my coworkers . I 'm in the process of getting my old , 5 dollar generic came with dell machine keyboard because i can't deal with this nonsense . Microsoft 's private label company who made this thing did a bad job with the details and now 1500 + people suffer from it . - Also , why is the business version 5 dollars ish , more ? Makes no sense , other than institutionalized procurement fraud and / or theft .  
2	  This little T.V. does everything it says it does . I recieved 6 channels right out of the box . Great for camping trips and power outages .  
1	  I bought this for my sister for her birthday . It didn't work . I contacted the company , which took way too long to respond . They said the problem was mechanical . I sent it in for repair . They sent it back and it worked .. for a few weeks . Now it won't start up anymore . Do NOT buy this product .  
1	  I have had this all in one and have really really liked it , however it uses 460w when starting up or copying or doing just about anything and that is too much for my house wiring . We got constant light flickering and if it was printing and you ran another power hog then it would trip the breaker . Brother would not help .. it is really a shame since this unit really does everything it says and fast ( the fuser takes all that power to heat up ) . If you have a new house then you should have no problem , I am afraid I had to return mine .  
2	  This is a replacement for my old thermos that broke when it dropped . This works great and holds the whole pot .  
1	  I was told by the cable company that this device was boosting the signal on the up load too much that it kept making my modem get off line even more . So before you spend the money on this , if you have a problem with your cable modem , make the cable company do their job . What they are pay to do and fix your problem .  
2	  Good quality . Works well . Excellent price . In my area we have nearly no " open " stations so I went to a direct feed cable . Still use in vehicles or rental cars that do not have a 3.5mm " in " or usb " in " . Out in the sticks where there are a lot of open frequencies it works fine . Update : As long as you do not live in a metro area like I do Chicago that has a lot of stations and little / no free channels . Does work fine in more rual areas . Actually have new vehicle with usb direct plug in so I 'm passing it along to someone else in the family who can use it .  
1	  The wires wore in numerous locations in less than 2 months . The gage is too small to hold up to active use . I would strongly suggest looking at an alternative . The sound quality is good which is typical of Sennheiser , but they have to improve the materials to justify the purchase .  
2	  Like many other reviewers here , I also had problems with the router ( WGR614v4 ) dropping the connection to the internet while the status indicator on the taskbar showed that it was ' Connected ' at 54Mbps with ' Excellent ' signal strength . This would happen 3-4 times a day . After a year of putting up with it ( no help from NetGear support ) , I was ready to throw it away and purchase another ( not NetGear ) router . Before I made the final decision , I went back to the NetGear website and discovered that my router was two firmware updates behind . So I downloaded the latest , updated the router , and changed the security from WEP to WPA-PSK . In addition , while I was in the updating mode I discovered that the wireless adapter ( LAN-Express AS IEE 802.11g miniPCI ) in my laptop also had a newer driver available . The new driver was supposed to " improve connectivity with a Wireless Access Point " , so I updated the laptop as well . Since these changes , the router has not dropped the connection-not even once ! True , it has only been a couple of weeks since the changes were made , but prior to the changes the connection would be lost after only minutes of use . Therefore , based on my experience with the router I am inclined to believe that the hardware is OK . Whether the problem was fixed by the router firmware update , or theadapter driver update is unknown-maybe a combination of both .  
1	  The Motorola SBG900 is notorious for its incompatibility with Vonage , the Voice over Internet protocol ( VOIP ) telephony provider . Vonage devices simply do not work reliably with this device if the router and network-address-translation firewall are enabled . Mine came from the internet service provider ( ISP ) so I had no choice in the matter - it was the cable modem the ISP insisted on issuing - so I had to negotiate with the ISP to cripple the firewall and router functions . Once that was done , it began to function as a simple cable modem and allowed me to connect my own router , which supports Vonage . Thus , if you are interested in using Vonage or a similar VOIP service , avoid the Motorola SBG900 .  
2	  Great invention ! No more messy liquids to deal with to get sparkling clean lenses . Order several . One for your camera case , desk drawer . pocket , purse , etc .  
1	  Avoid these headphones at all costs , especially if you would buy these to listen with while you work out . Mine lasted for about a month and a half before the cord started decomposing . The material used is very poor , the white turns yellow and then disintegrates just through normal use . If you are considering these for working out , don't buy them , they will not stay in your ears . That is assuming you sweat when you workout , these will slip out and just become more of an annoyance than anything .  
2	  Exactly the right fit for my Canon Powershot SX10 IS , there 's room for the camera and lens hood , a lens cleaning kit , mini tripod , SD cards and TWO SETS of extra batteries . All this in a well constructed bag that 's not too bulky and offers superior protection for my camera . Only slight beef I 've got is that the sewn-in microfiber cloth leaves so much lint on the camera lens it 's outright unusable . HOWEVER .. haven't done it with this model yet , but I 've owned two other LowePro camera cases that washed nicely in a FRONT-LOADING machine . I used cold water , avoided fabric softener and hung them indoors to dry . I expect when I give this bag its first laundering , the lint on the sewn-in microfiber cloth will be a thing of the past , and what a handy little extra it will be .  
1	  I have read most of the reviews ( good and bad ) written here for the Palm hard case . I have gotten my palm pilot last week and went to Compusa to find a case . I saw the Palm Hard case and I agree with the other reviewers who commented that it looks cheap and not sturdy at all . This case does not look worth [ price ] at all . I ended up buying IBIZ Aluminum travel hardcase . This IBIZ hardcase is made of rugged aircraft aluminum and your palm is totally enclosed except for the part where you beam and about an inch on the side where the stylus is . This case looks very sleek and comes in black or silver . The best part of this product is it only costs [ price ] in Compusa . I suggest you check this out before buying the palm hard case . WARNING : You may have to shave the stylus used to attach to the palm .. I had some trouble putting the palm in the case but after that .. everything was cool .  
2	  The carrying case was a little smaller then I expected but other then that it 's fine . It was well worth the cost .  
2	  The digital camera worked very well . The price was right and the packaging and delivery time were excellent . Thank you .  
1	  After returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams , the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them . In trying to overcome this through HP 's support line , the recorded message said I would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call ( twice ) . Returned that version also .  
2	  All you need to know is that there is an international mode that allows this device to operate in completely empty frequencies in the 80s . To accomplish this , hold down the " preset " button until the US mode flashes . Change it to international . Then go down to 87.7 or 87.9 and enjoy a clear band . If you have the problem of the international mode power saving bug ( the device shuts off automatically after one minute , no matter what volume you set your audio device to ) , just save the low frequencies to the memory , then switch back to US mode . Your transmitter will say that you are at 107.9FM , but it 's actually at 87.7 or 87.9 , and the power saving bug is not an issue .  
2	  all around no hassle product . haven't reset once in 2 years .  
1	  This printer works well , was reviewed well online , and does exactly what it is supposed to . The problem is the software , it 's a NIGHTMARE . I always have to fight to get it to print . Either you let windows install the printer , or use the driver on the cd , and when you print you just get an error message , and have to reboot the computer to get it to print , OR you install all the unnecessary software made for servers , send it to print in the " paper port " program , then have to tell that program to print it . Either way if you buy this printer you can no longet in 1 quick step print your pages . Oh and by-the-way , I use windows XP Home so nothing outdated , but noticed it works a little better with XP Pro .  
2	  I was going to originally re-order a different brand of ear buds that I loved , or at least I thought I loved . I saw these and knowing Sennheiser I knew that had to be pretty decent . And for the price I decided to give them a shot . These ear-buds are perfect ! They have amazing sound , they fit perfect and dont slip out . My other ones would slip out when I wore them to the gym , yet these ones stay in even with a head full of sweat . IF YOU NEED EAR-BUDS , GET THESE !  
1	  CAUTION : I am almost certain this review will apply to this model , though I recently bought ( and returned ) a similar model . Both are about the same price ( I bought mine at Sam 's Club ) . Mine is ( was ) a 1.5x24 , this one is a 2.0x24 , but otherwise the specs appear to be the same . And the shape and size are the same between the two models , just a different color scheme . The advertising on both says it can be used for surveillance , etc . Not so ! If you merely wanted to observe for a while , or wait until the person did something specific or moved to a particular position before deciding what you do next , forget it - he 's already aware of you because he can see your red light pointing directly at him . There may be infrared coming out the front , but there 's also visible red light which , by definition , is not infrared ( which lies between visible light and microwave frequencies ) . The pictures on the packaging were deceptive at best , also . Focus is nowhere near as good as what 's depicted in the advertising . And make SURE you read the instructions first about initial focus , or you 'll never be able to figure out how to focus it . I really wanted this to work , but was concerned about how good or poor a low-end night vision scope would be . I took it back the very next evening . I 'll have to save up for a more expensive scope if I really want a good one that much - this model is not much more than an expensive toy . I wasn't expecting the quality of night vision equipment used by the military , but this was still unacceptable .  
1	  I do not understand how someone has not taken action against Sony for this product . If there 's a laywer out there in search for a class action , they should look into this . I am using a GRV550 right now and this is the third time I start writing a review .. it shut down twice in less than an hour ! Besides that major flaw , this machine is extremely noisy and it gets extremely hot . If you take those three into account , you rule out 99 % of the settings where a laptop would be of any use . I contacted their customer support a couple of times and they were helplessly hopeless - or hopelessly helpless .. They basically ask you to reset the bios . They obviously already know this thing is a lemon so they will just make you waste some time . I would gladly return this piece of plastic if I could . Won't be getting any more Sony during this lifetime for sure !  
2	  I looked all over and found the cheapest battery to be here at Amazon . Even with the Saturday delivery surcharge , the price was well under what I was looking at buying locally . As a result , I was a little nervous about what the quality would be . However , I was very pleased with this product , it actually worked better than the original battery that came with my camcorder . It charged quickly and held its charge for a while . I rewound and played through a full tape to see how long the battery would last and by the end of the tape , the battery was still fully charged . I 'd recommend this battery to anyone considering purchasing it !  
1	  I own a 48x24x48 ext usb 2.0 Iomega burner for my notebook and so thought I would get a usb 2.0 pcmcia card for it . Well , to make a long story short I simply couldn't get it to completely install . I downloaded the most recent drivers from Adaptec , followed all their instructions on the website , etc . , etc . No go for burning . I was able to get it to read from the external drive , so it wasn't a total waste . Upon looking at several other reviews I have discovered that many people have had similiar problems with this card , although I have seen one person mention that the Win XP SP1 contained drivers for the card itself I still was unable to get results from it . ( I tried it on Win OS 's 2000 , XP Home and XP Pro with and without the most recent SP 's from Microsoft and with older and newer drivers , btw . ) However , one interesting thing I have come across from a few reviewers is it 's surprisingly efficient compatibility with Linux ! One review that came to mind mentioned Red Hat 7.3 as the one he found it working with . For those of us who are stuck supporting themselves by using Windows based programs though ( mostly page layout ) this may be interesting but not really helpful practically . :) I am going to keep the card in the hopes that Adaptec will release a driver that works in the future , though , as I know that this company usually makes excellent products . In the meantime , I bought another usb 2.0 pcmcia card from OrangeMicro .  
1	  This is a great case , however , even with the top removed , the IIc will not fit into the case . Had to return the case . Worthless .  
1	  Product works great when it 's not broken . Have gone through two in the last two years . First one had an electronic issue . The second broke in half . Product needs to be improved before I buy another one .  
2	  This purchase was good . It worked perfectly , quick shipping and new in original package . No problems  
2	  The headset works very well , is comfortable to wear and the sound quality is great ! The price is outstanding as well .  
1	  These are actually very nice , except for one fatal flaw which makes them unusable . The adjustment for interpupillary distance is VERY limited . Interpupillary distance is the distance between the two halves of binoculars . It 's the first thing you adjust when you pick a pair up . If the interpupillary distance doesn't match the viewer 's head , he can't see through both eyes simultaneously , and that definitely ruins the whole binocular effect . With the Bushnells , that number is apparently some kind of secret - the Bushnell website doesn't have it , although there are plenty of other technical numbers in the product specs ( exit pupil , eye relief , etc ) . On these , I measure about 68mm max adjustment of interpupillary distance . This is quite small - not much more than 50th percentile for American men . I personally need about 76mm spacing , though I can squeak by at 75mm . ( Obviously , I have a big fat head , but that 's not my fault . ) At maximum setting , the eyepieces of these binocs are about 5/16 " too close together , so I can't look through both eyes at once . And that makes them basically useless . I have other binoculars from Celestron and Oberwerk which are ( just barely ) OK ; why Bushnell couldn't make these open out to a more-or-less standard distance is a mystery . In other respects , these are quite good . They 're light , and easy to hold ( moderately ) steady without a tripod . The images are sharp , without obvious optical aberrations . ( Though of course I didn't give them a thorough visual workout , since I can only see through one side at a time . ) The focus lever thing , while a tad unusual , works fine , and the case is decent ( a modern-style floppy synthetic fabric thing , not a stiff leather case like binocs had fifty years ago ) . But they simply don't fit , so back they go . Customers with relatively close-set eyes might find them excellent .  
1	  I knew the price was too low for a leather bag .. but I was hopeful . It feels cheaply made and extremely stiff . The shoulder straps are not long enough for me either . The bag arrived crammed in a box without any wrapper around it and bag is a little dinged up . There was only one little tag on the bag . There wasn't even any paperwork with it . Won't buy from this company again .  
2	  I bought this extra memory as the Nikon Coolpix S10 camera comes with 1GB card . For videos and photos this 1GB is too little .  
2	  I mainly use it when getting ready , but it has great sound that carries throughout my house . Definitely would recommend .  
2	  since I purchased this disc cleaner , I have no more skips , or distortions . It is everything I hoped it would be . It even keeps my dvd player working well . If I had a need I would deffinately buy another one .  
2	  Nice size camera ! Since I don't like to read manuals and I 'm not technically savvy , what I liked most about the camera is that it 's very user friendly . Easy to figure out without any reading . Video works great .. went whitewater rafting and took some cool pictures . Purchased a mini tripod and the timer is simple to set and takes great pictures . So far the hardest thing is downloading the pictures to the cd that it came with . But I just need to spend time using all the features to the program . I would recommend if you 're doing a lot of video recording or recording for long periods of time , to buy an extra battery .  
2	  It 's speaker wire , what more could you expect ? 1 ) It 's white so it blends with white walls , and 2 ) it 's color coated . My only complaint is that the color is more of an off-white / cream , not a big deal though . Does the job .  
2	  Wow , amazing sound for such small speakers ! They are a bit pricey but what Bose product isn't . I think they are worth more around $ 199.99 but when there is no competition I guess you can afford to charge more . Oh sure there are speaker systems that sound as good and even better but NOT this small . I have another set of Bose speakers that actually sound better but even they are bigger . I needed something small for my computer workstation and these fit the bill perfectly . One thing that should be noted is that the EQ of your sound card can make a huge difference in how these sound . I have the Creative X-Fi and it has some interesting EQ modes which swing wildly from one end of the spectrum to the other . The only complaint and the reason I went 4 stars : I would have preferred the bass and power controls on the front of the sub woofer instead of the backside or even better on the hockey puck controller . ( I love that controller ! ) WARNING : If you are considering the Bose Companion 5 , be sure and read my review on it before you order them . I strongly recommend you go to a store that has both the Companion 3 and 5 on display and compare them . They are totally different animals ! Be blessed !  
1	  I purchased this tv / vcr combo in February and in June the VCR , during fast forward and rewind would stop , shut off the TV , and eject the tape . Took it in for repair and a microprocessor / voltage problem is too expensive to fix . So now I just have a TV with a VCR that can only PLAY . I would not recommend this set .  
2	  Purchased it so I don't have to buy batteries all the time , great price . Only thing different is the weight of the controller but you get used to it !  
2	  Going from SD to HD is like seeing the world through new glasses . What a difference . The TV has an amazing picture and the price is very good compared to others with simular features . I was a litle worried because of some of the negative talk about the glossy screen . It has less glare than a CRT so it has been a none issue for me and itlooks nice . I could not be more please and can hardly wait to gat a HD DVD player hooked up .  
2	  Hooked it up to my Tivo and it does level the sound . Hopefully it will last for a long long time . I noticed the instructions read that is has a limit on the amount of sound you can pump through it , so over doing it would probably kill it .  
1	  It looks just like the old Crosleys but the sound quality isn't good and various features stopped working over the course of its first year . Maybe mine was a lemon ? I 'm not going to buy another to find out .  
2	  I bought the system , it is fine worked perfectly . An electronic fan seem to have got all the modem that was ever on sale at amazon . com which is very suspicious to me because why would anyone need 18 routers and 37 modem ? I 've been doing research on what modem i should get and his review are on almost every single modem giving it a good review then a bad review  
2	  I purchased this headset for use with Yahoo Instant Messenger with Voice . It was at a reasonable price and it works as I was able to speak to the other person and I heard them clearly , so I 'm satisfied , but it was a bit tricky to adjust the microphone so that it didn't brush against my mouth as I was speaking . Can't seem to quite get it to fit snuggly on my head .  
1	  I had several months worth of important documents on this . I know I should have backed them up elsewhere but I didn't .. and one day this thing stopped lighting up and cannot be recognized by any PC . I looked this up online and it is a known issue . If you don't believe me , then type " cruzer 2gb dead " into Google and see for yourself how there are hundreds of other very unhappy people who tried to go cheap by buying one of these and is now in agony . I only write this review so that other people ( hopefully ) will not have to go through what I did . Instead I would highly recommend the 32GB mini by Corsair , something that accidentally went through the washer and dryer ( and still works perfectly ) ! This product , however , is junk ; I did nothing to provoke its death . It 's also loaded with bloatware which cuts in on the already-measly 2GB . As a final warning , if you go to Sandisk 's official website you 'll see that their forums are loaded with complaints about this , and the only response provided is that " there 's nothing you can do now " and / or " it isn't Sandisk 's fault " . So .. please don't encourage them to keep mass-distributing this faulty product and instead buy something more reliable .  
1	  In getting these earphones I was looking for something ultra-portable , easy , and good sounding . By ultra-portable I mean I want to carry them in my jeans pocket every day . While these headphones are sturdy , the sturdiness comes at a price : the case is about 1 1/4 " thick , so they don't meet my pocket-friendly requirement . These are my first experience with in-ear earphones . While they come with a wide variety of ear-piece fittings , I couldn't really find one that stayed securely in my left ear . Maybe I 've got an extra-wide ear canal . Maybe I 'm just uncomfortable jamming something in there so deep . So they aren't as easy and convenient as I wanted . When in position , they do sound great . The sound quality varies a lot if they come out of position even a little , though . For someone who doesn't have the same criteria as me , and who has had success with in-ear earphones , these could be great . But they just weren't what I was looking for .  
2	  Solid construction and all the basics . Easy set up for the most part ( I had trouble only with setting up the safety stop ) . The optics are fine for home use , and it 's easy to use . The small set of prepared slides was a very nice surprise . Only two things would make it a little more user-friendly : coarse and fine focus adjustments on the same dial ( similar to the stage adjustment ) , and a switch on the light source . Overall I would definitely recommend this for the hobbyist ; it 's a great value for the price .  
2	  Excellent lens from Olympus ! I was Nikon fan for the last 20 years and when I sold my trustworthy N8008 film camera I started to look at Nikon and Canon digital SLR . The result of my research - for the price , quality and features , Olympus Evolt 510 beats everybody else with one arm tied behind its back . You have to go with high grade lens like this Olympus 14-54 to get the full effect . This lens is very sharp , bright and lack any distortion like no other . It cost more than standard lenses but as everything else in life , you get what you paid for . Strongly recommend to anyone with average or above skill .  
1	  I got this unit and tried using it to clean my lens , using the brush end added grease to my lens . After reading reviews , one of them said that it maybe a counter fit . The other side seems to work fine . I saw a piece of lint in the viewfinder so I tried using the brush to brush it away . When I looked through , not only did it get worse because the brush fibers fell off , now it left a greasy smear on the view finder . I called Canon about my T3i , and it has to be sent in for repair . After reading more about how to clean the view finder , it was safer to send it to the service center to have it done professionally . It is just sad that I will be without my camera for the duration of the repair . Don't make the same mistake I do . If you are going to use it , use it only for the front of the lens . Where at least you can clean the greasy residue off .  
2	  This is a great product to have . It & # 8217 ; s necessary to make un-combatable conations , & # 8230 ; compatible ! Not all connectors are RCA . The RCA-BNC famale / male adapter is a life saver when you need to make connections between different components .  
2	  What can you say about a power adapter ? It works . It 's Casio , not a knock-off brand . There is nothing to fear , as long as it is the correct model number for what you need to power .  
2	  It 's exactly what is advertised and works perfectly with myManfrotto 725B Digi Tripod with Integrated Ball Head with Dove Tail Plate and Carrying Bag ( Black ) . I keep the plate that came with the tripod on my Digital SLR camera and I keep the extra one I bought on my camcorder .  
1	  I bought this as an alternative to the expensive PalmConnect adapter , for my Vx . The driver works with System 8.6 , very shaky with OS . 9 , extension conflicts in OS . 9.2.2 , and it doesn't support OS.X.The support is none existing .  
1	  Please be aware that this is not a genuine XM cassette adapter . The item came in the envelope in just a small plastic bag with no indication of brand / company address or whatsoever . The adapter is 100 % not-working . I plugged it into the car cassette player . After 5 seconds it gets ejected . Tried 5 times . Spend couple more bucks and buy original adapter . This thing is completely useless ! My first bad experience on amazon .  
2	  I love the iGo system . It really works great . This tip works great with my iPod classic , 1st generation iPhone ( before I sold it ) and now my current iPhone 3G wireless phone . I use it with the iGo home wall charger , car charger , and battery quick charger . It is a good system . Highly recommended !  
2	  What 's to be said ; You 're getting the same original Canon product for 20 % - 30 % less , plus free shipping ( if you don't want it the next day )  
1	  i saw these back when they were more expensive , i thought spending a bit more than those 9.99 ear phones will be worth it in the long run .. but they didnt last not even a month ! .. they worked fine for about three weeks , then i tried to sleep with them , and they kept falling out .. the sound is ok , it brags about bass , but you cant seriously hear any bass , i listen to dub , reggae and rap , in order to hear the bass , you literally have to shove the ear bud as far as possible , you are basically raping your own ear .. they finally broke two days ago , all of a sudden the sound went choppy in one ear until it was gone .. less than an hour later the other ear bud died , it had something to do with the cable , right where it connects to my mp3 , every time i moved it around i just kept hearing choppiness .. over priced , weak sound , vmoda ? .. im going to buy some better electronics with better known brands that i have come to trust in the past ..  
1	  I was looking for a " do-it-all " player for music , voice and audiobooks . Although the iRiver T30 handles the first two functions pretty well , I advise you not to buy this unit for its support of Audible files . In this mode it works ( sort of ) , but I have discovered several very annoying quirks . As soon as I use the voice recording feature , the unit : 1 ) Will not save bookmarks in an Audible file . 2 ) Will not retain the last position in memory when I exit from an Audible file . When this happens , the only solution I have found is to completely reformat the device and reinstall the operating system . As well , when the unit 's battery runs out in the middle of listening to an Audible file , the entire file is no longer recognized by the player . I must load a new copy of the file to continue .  
2	  Although it 's for TomTom , it works with any software . The only problem was on my iPod , bluetooth doesn't usually pass GPS info . TomTom works around it in their app . But I wasn't using their app . I had to jailbreak and buy a more robust GPS stack . Really my fault , but at least it 's doable !  
2	  charges my Olympus batteries , but does not charge my other brand extended hours batteries . I can use my camera again . very satisfied ..  
2	  This flash does a great job with my canon 60D while shooting with the flash off camera . The exposures are really accurate and can use it with a modifier too . All around good build and design . Save your money and go with the 580ex , then buy the 430ex second .  
2	  This lens is great ! I used it to photograph the giant pandas at the National Zoo and I got so many good close-ups . I strongly suggest this lens !  
2	  No frills basic receiver with excellent power . I think Yamaha under rates their output , seems more than 50 watts per chan . Was bought to replace an older Yamaha product and Yamaha styling still perfectly matches my other components .  
2	  I 've had a few of these - they 're great , but there 's been a tendency for the wires to split ( I think from cold weather ) . They 're compact and deliver great sound .  
1	  Bought 4 ! They don't work . The batteries do not last . We are trying to return them  
1	  This printer does a fine job on the photos - when it 's actually working that is . I 've had 3 of these damn things and every single one of them had the same problems . First , the paper wouldn't feed . No matter what I tried or whatever Kodak told me to do , they never lost this problem . All 3 of them did this ! . Second , the printer started to print only the top half or bottom half of the photo . Again ALL 3 DID THIS TOO ! Kodak wanted me to send it to them so they could " fix " it for $ 250 - about the price of a new unit . I refused since it would have been the same printer with the same problems . I had already done that once and that 's now one of the units that is screwed up . Now I 'm stuck with 3 packages of supplies and no printer to use them on . This is ridiculous . Kodak knew this was a problem and refused to do anything warranty wise about it . A friend of mine had the EXACT SAME PROBLEMS that I did . That 's 4 in all . To top it off , they no longer support this unit . Thanks Kodak . It 's no wonder you 're going out of business . Shame on you for hanging us with this one . One smaller problem is their software . It all to often has some kind of fit and won't " see " my camera . It usually takes some frogging around with it to get it to finally see the camera or sync with it . Updated software did nothing to help it . Sorry but I 'm inclined to think that those of you who have had no problems with this printer dock must work for Kodak .  
1	  I have a 5G 60gb black video ipod , this product was soo small and did NOT fit the dimensions of my ipod as is advertised . The individual pieces slide on fine , but when you try to snap them closed , it is too tight and does not snap , thus does not work . Also it should be note , the plastic is very cheap , while it is thick .. it is also not very durable and can easily crack . TOTALLY NOT WORTH $ 30 . Look for a different brand in ipod cases , there are others out there that I have had much success with in the past .  
2	  It works fine .. I ` ve been having a little bit of problems for it to catch a station , but once it does , it works fine , with a bit of interference every now and then , but overall , it ` s a good deal .. Besides , it ` s way cheaper than the ones sold in stores !  
1	  I will never ever buy this again ! When I got this order I tried to put it together . However the parts that screwed the base on didn't work and were to small . Also the little knobs on the top ? Yeah the pre drilled holes were to small to place on the tower parts itself . This was the worst purchase I have ever made . I do want to say that Amazon 's part was great . I got the tower in great time . My complaint is with the manufactor that gives crap pieces to put something together !  
1	  After calling Customer Service ( generally very helpful ) to install the first Z1420 that I received , we diagnosed an inoperable wireless print server . OK , Lexmark said to keep that one and use it until a replacement arrived . The second installation stalled at the exact same step . Figuring I must be doing something wrong , I called Customer Service again . After going through all sorts of restarts , the CS Rep said that I had a second defective wifi unit ! What sort of error rate would they have for these printers that I got 2 defective ones ? ! ? Since this was a great inconvenience to me , Lexmark said that they would send an " upgraded printer that might also be a scanner " . I thought , " OK , whatever , just get me one that works ! " The ' all-in-one ' that I received next did not have built-in wireless . What kind of an upgrade is that - not having the one feature I bought the printer for ? ! ? Fortunately , when I called Customer Service , the rep quickly agreed that I was sent the wrong type of printer and agreed to send me a wireless all-in-one ( X4530 ) . Well , two days later an X4550 arrived . That one installed fine on my ' base ' desktop computer that is connected to my wireless router , but I had to call Customer Service ( again ) for help installing my laptop . This CS rep was not so friendly , and tried to blame the problem on the amount of RAM on my laptop . While helping me , he also tried to insult my internet connection , but I told him I have a high-speed cable connection , so he gave up on that . I could not accept the RAM explanation , and I told him that there was no way that the low amount of RAM was preventing my laptop from sending a simple document through the air to my wireless router ! After some reconfiguring of some settings , he was able to get the printer working properly . ( Note : Except for the fact that my computer was running slowly as it was apparently still trying to " wake up " and the software incorrectly directing me to use the USB printer cable when installing the laptop , I think I could have installed the laptop without having to call CS . ) So , to sum it up , the printer is wirelessly printing now , both from the base computer and from my laptop . Quality is just fine for school projects , maps , and other household uses . I haven't tried photos yet , but the sample page had a picture that came out OK . I have had quite an ordeal with what I expected to be a simple printer purchase , but Lexmark has done the right thing , and I expect I will be happy with the printer now .  
1	  Despite the specific claim to be compatible with the Dell GX110 , this memory module DID NOT function in my machine . However , after my consultation with tech support the vendor cheerfully offered to refund my money . So , five stars to the vendor ( presuming I do eventually get a refund ) and two stars for the product . Footnote : Finally got the correct memory module from " another " vendor who has the same exact mailing address . Go figure ? Update Jan . 18 - finally received credit on this return , but it wasn't the vendor 's fault , Amazon dropped the ball . But everything eventually got taken care of , no problems with either party .  
2	  I already owned the Bose Sound Dock , which certainly provides power to bring the music on your iPod to life .. well , this system is truly room - even house-filling . And it 's got the dynamic range to reach more longer distances . The amp provides a really intense depth and reach to the overall sound . Ever since I bought the iPod , I dreamt of finding a way to make it my main music system .. well , that 's what the iFi does ! I do not use anything but this system in my home anymore ! And for what you get .. the price is great . Yes , the remote is tiny , very basic and difficult to handle , but a minor quibble overall .  
2	  Thank goodness Philips was one of the first companies to trim the fat on the older vcr chasis box size standard . Also , commendations for including large heat vents on the side of this and other various Philips vcr models . After all , a large percentage of vcr equipment failing within the first 2 years or so is due to poor heat and air ventilation ; heat kills , end of story . This particular model makes one wonder if it 's even worth spending another ( $ ) or so for the S-VHS version ( not offered currently on Amazon . com ) . I 've compared both and found little difference unless you 're a heavy recorder . The S-VHS quality closely resembles the original recorded source but don't expect dvd calibre . On this regular hi-fi model there is a tad-bit of red color bleed ( look at objects or letters in red and notice the artifcat known as dot-crawl ) . Color bleed is when the electronics of any video medium , to certain degree in error , allow reds , some blues and greens to seep out of the objects ' or images ' edges causing a sort of smeared-edgy look . The audio hi-fi portion is very clear and dialogue is also very articulate . The hi-fi audio level is quite exceptional . I once owned a hi-end , reputable brand name vcr where the hi-fi audio was horrendous . It suffered from low sound level . The highs were lows and the bass had no " punch " . Dialogue was nothing but babble and the video always had a muddled and streaked look ( regardless of cleaning the heads or not ) . As for price , it 's almost average or acceptable when you compare buying a low-end dvd player for about ( $ ) . I would not spend more than ( $ ) for this vcr model . Also , previous reviewers who mentioned their previous / serious problems with this model , I too believe you . While this Philips model I purchased does not suffer ( yet ) from any problems , I have owned more expensive brand named vcrs and were shocked they did not last past 3-5 years under normal usage ( then , again what 's normal ) . In total sum , nothing more irritable and inconveninent than purchasing from a reputable brand name and having the unit fail you .. So far for me this has not been this case with this model ( and yes , I 've had it for quite some time ) ..  
2	  I use it with MythTV and it works really well . All the standard keys work as advertised and it is easy to reprogram keys using the mapping tables in MythTV . We use it in a bedroom so the remote is about 12 feet away from the receiver . I 've been using it for a year now with no issues . One complaint - the keys are a little stiff .  
2	  Needed to get an HD signal on my PC 's monitor , it works great . Haven't had any problem , HD 720p videos look fantastic . And is much cheaper than many other brands . Fantastic video quality for the price .  
2	  With most cables , music is bright yellow dots . For some reason , music played through this cable is lime green triangles . It must be a factor of the high-purity copper wire . If you like lime green triangles , you will love this cable . If not , I would recommend a standard purity copper wire .  
1	  I read other reviews here about folks having problems with this product , but wrote them off . That was a mistake . I got this item on sale , so I didn't pay nearly as much as other folks here , but it broke after just a couple weeks . Suddenly it would start losing power to some of its outlets , then turn them on and off randomly - even when set to unswitched . I 'm going to end up RMA'ing it to Monster Power , but I can't recommend this product to anyone else .  
1	  I loved my Palm m505 but it started failing to hot sync after less than a year . The Tech Support people were very polite and responsive but none of their suggestions helped . My husband 's m515 failed to hot sync after only 6 months . ( We use different desktops so it 's not a problem with one individual computer . ) For us , [ $ ] or so is a lot of money to pay for an electronic device that works for less than a year . I will never buy another Palm product . Which is too bad , because I love the way their products work , when they work .  
2	  I use my IPOD to keep me company on my bike rides . I put the IPOD in my back shirt pocket , have this unit mounted to my handle bars and I can easily change volume , songs , etc . without having to fiddle with my IPOD . Highly recommended , especially for cyclists .  
2	  It does not always eject well with U3 installed . I have removed it and it is working well . Also I do not like how the light will sometimes stay on after ejection . Other than that it is a great product . Very durable and plenty of space .  
1	  DVD player quit working after one movie . After unit cools off over night , it acts as if it wants to start but doesn't . CD player just stops from time to time and has to be restarted . The automatic VCR tracking does not seem to work .  
2	  This is a heavy duty organizer , sits on the desk or hangs on the wall . Plenty of trays for everything I have and a place to label each tray . Thinking of buying another one or a project I am doing .  
2	  This printer was exactly as described , in excellent condition with all the plugs and connections included . It also included the CD installation disc . It was completely functional on arrival and arrived before expected . I could see no nicks etc . It was exactly what I was looking for to replace my " dead one " . Thanks so much for your great service and a very excellent deal !  
2	  I got 4 of these gadgets . I have a lot of scanners , radios , and computers . Until now I could more or less hear any source in nearly any receptor . But today I saw the modification ( " upgrade " ) to improve transmission power and .. eureka ! now I have a full interconnected audio network , and don't lose a word from anywhere to everywhere . The gadget is well worth its price . Buy it , upgrade it and ENJOY it . By the way , the modification doesn't bring any nasty lateral effects at all . No degradation of the signal / noise ratio , nor any kind of noise boosting . Just a more powerful but still clean signal ( - make sure you are choosing an unused or weakly used frequency ) . Only beware to adjust the resistor so not to bother your neighbors with your transmissions ( or organize kind of " pay per hear " :-) . Turn VR2 fully clockwise ( as recommended by another reviewer ) only then and if really needed .  
1	  So I bought this mic for $ 10 at Wal-Mart thinking it was like my friends mic which he just plugged in and can talk through . WRONG ! Not in this world will you get quality products like you do from Logitech will you get from this company . I have to hold the mic closer than my headset mic in order for my friend to understand me . So yes , this product is a Desktop Microphone that you cant actually put on your desk to talk through ( unless you lean over ) . The sound quality is horrible too . When I actually do pick up the microphone while I 'm playing a game , I 'm probably understandable 1/10 times . If you want a quality mic for $ 10 look else where . Biggest piece of junk ever . It 's a headset microphone that you put on your desk . I guess I should just tape it to my head to get the same effect . GET THIS INSTEAD  
1	  Product arrived promptly and in good condition . However , the female jack does not fit properly with my headphones . If you insert the male headphone plug fully into this cable , the sound is hollow and nearly silent . If you fiddle with the connection and pull the headphone plug out slightly , the sound is great . Getting it right is a pain and will probably increase wear and tear on the connectors . I 'm looking for another productNote : this is result was achieved with Bose MIE2 earbuds ( with iphone controls ) . The earbuds are top quality and have given me no trouble with other products / accessories , so this cable is definitely at fault  
2	  If you are upgrading from ear buds , you aren't going to want to go back . These head phones deliver pristine audio quality . Whether you are using them for music or other sound work , they provide the results you want . They are quite comfortable and block out essentially all the sound around you . I still use ear buds when I want portability , but when I 'm working on a project or just looking for an optimal audio experience , I use my Sony Studio Headphones . They come in a carry bag , so they are portable , but aren't good for light weight packing , or for use during travel . Pros : Comfortable , Phenomenal sound quality , Great noise cancelling . Cons : Not good for use during travel , Padding wears out after long term use . The pads are replaceable , although replacement can be a little frustrating . Overall : Fantastic product . I would highly recommend them .  
2	  Excellent sound quality / utility for the price . Durable and COMFORTABLE construction . Thick wire so it ain't cheap and won't twist and rip . Comes with a adapter so you could plug it into your keyboard , sound system , DJ Turntable systems , etc . Or you could not use the adapter and just plug it into your PC or any 3.5 mm jack . I 'd recommend 100 % to get this if you just need some affordable and quality headphones you can use ANYTIME .  
2	  I decided to purchase this mp3 player after giving heavy consideration to the iRiver and iAudio players . My primary reason for picking this player was that at the time that I bought it , Amazon had it at a special sale price of $ 82.99 . That 's less than how much you have to pay to get a 128 MB iriver or iAudio player . I received this player a couple of days ago and have been playing with it since . I didn't install the software but plugged the player straight into my Computer and uploaded songs . My computer unfortunately doesn't support USB 2.0 so the transfer was slow , so I would recommend that you check if your computer supports USB 2.0 or not . If it doesn't , the MuVo NX is a cheaper alternate option . I uploaded my songs in folders since they are organized in albums . I was able to fit 3 full albums and 10 more miscellaneous songs , mostly ripped at 192kbps . I feel that the LCD screen and the controls are a bit too small , but I was able to get used to them and did like the scroll-wheel feature . The MuVo is feature-packed . It provides standard repeat and shuffle features , has a customizable equalizer , a voice recorder , the ability to skip from folder to folder , and set various screen options . The sound was excellent when I set the equalizer to my liking . I listen to a lot of bass-heavy music , so I cranked up the bass , and even using the included headphones the music sounded great . The included ear-phones did sound decent and sounded better than comparable stock-headphones . I 'm still waiting for my Senn PX100 headphones to arrive . Overall , this is an excellent little player . I was amazed at how small and light it is , and it is extremely convenient to carry it around . I would definately recommend this .  
2	  These speakers were purchased for an outdoor patio installation and I couldn't be happier with them . They are solidly built and simple to install . These speakers produce great sound for a really small cost ! UPDATE 6-16-2011I have had these speakers installed outdoors for a year and have noted a small amount of rust developing on the metal speaker covers . Not exactly sure what I am going to do once more rust develops but it is manageable for now . Also , the bracket clamps do not hold the weight of the speakers in position and the speakers tend to droop downward not long after you tighten them .  
1	  This device looks good , has a nice feel but just doesn't compare to a Pronto . Tech support from Logitech is just okay , they don't get back to you with 2nd or 3rd level support . 1st level can't really answer many questions at all . I have issues with the remote being able to turn on the correct devices for the various activities I like to use with my home theater . Macro capabilities don't really exist and for any serious home theater aficionados this device just doesn't cut the mustard . It is a good universal remote with some extra features not offered by the typical universal but it 's not worth the additional price . If you are a serious home theater user get a Pronto .  
1	  Purchased this camera for the waterpark . The first picture was crystal clear and then the remaining pictures were all cloudy and some were barely visable . For a waterproof camera , I felt it wasn't waterproof at all and it wasn't worth the amount I spent on the camera and processing . I wouldn't recommend it .  
2	  [ UPDATE 11/2/10 : For some reason certain keys just stopped registering about a month ago . I replaced the keyboard with a much worse keyboard , returned that , and then Kensington worked fine after taking it apart and cleaning it . For about a week . The numberpad was entirely unresponsive , and the letters b , n , m were intermittent . On top of that , all the keys had become difficult to press overtime . This seemed to occur as a result of natural wear . Overall I 'm still giving it 4 stars because it met our needs and lasted quite a while before needing to be replaced . ] I bought this Kensington keyboard and mouse combo at the end of November or beginning of December and have been waiting for it to show any problems . The keyboard hasn't so far , I can't say anything for the mouse since I have no use for it . I was needed a wireless keyboard that I could use in combination with my Logitech " Cordless Optical Trackman . " I would have bought this one Logitech keyboard but Logitech told me that the software would conflict with the Trackman trackball that I intend on using . So my search was based on wireless keyboards that didn't require crazy software that might mess with my trackball 's performance and features . I figured finding the right keyboard would be a trial and error situation . While xmas shopping at Best Buy I spotted this Kensington keyboard for only $ 40 as an open-box special ( somebody returned it ) so I decided to give it a try . I got it home and read the manual and it turns out you don't need to install the included drivers and whatnot that come with the keyboard . You only need to use that if you want the Function keys to have their special other use that this keyboard offers . I just plugged the usb dongle in , put batteries in the keyboard , and it worked fine ! Even the media player buttons work without any special drivers installed . That was an unexpected surprise , and I use them all the time now . This keyboard is used in my living room with my main computer which doubles as the center of my media experience . I am using a USB extension cord with the keyboard 's dongle so I can sit the dongle up higher to help with RF " visibility " . I get fine reception from every seat in my living room , none are further than about 12 ft from the usb receiver . Sometimes line-of-sight issues occur if I have the keyboard sitting on a pillow on my lap , but I just re-situate the pillow and that problem goes away . I 'm sitting on my couch right now as I 'm typing this . Oh , and I 'm still on the first set of batteries , too . It 's been almost 3 months of use , typically at least 6 hours a day , and the batteries are still good . I don't know why all the ther reviewers had such a hard time with this set . Maybe they used the cd-rom 's drivers / software and that was the problem ? * This review is only for the keyboard . I haven't used the mouse so I don't know if the mouse is any good . The keyboard works perfectly with my Logitech Trackman trackball , so I 'm happy . * [ EDIT ] My Kensington keyboard finally broke and needed replaced last week . We kept our keyboard under the couch when not using it , and when retrieving it sometimes we 'd lift up too soon and the keyboard would bend against the bottom edge of the couch . It could only take so much of that , and eventually ( I assume ) the circuit board inside must have cracked . The top line of keys ( q w e r t y u i o p ) stop working consistently . This was a great keyboard , but like most others it is not rugged enough for living room use . Most wireless keyboards seem to be intended to just sit still on a desk their entire lifetime . Also , the batteries last about 10 months in this Kensington keyboard .  
1	  If you connected the USB connection from the back of the head unit when you first did the install simply connect the white iPod adapter you received with the iPod into the USB and it will work just the same . Free is better than $ 29.99 .  
1	  This remote is mostly for outdoor use - very good to navigate the iPod while it is tucked inside your pocket , mostly with the keypad put on hold . Would have been great if the remote was wireless . It is not very useful indoors since you have to get near the iPod to operate the remote - you might as well put your fingers on the iPod itself . This used to come free with the 3G iPods , along with the leather case ( that 's how I got it ! ) . I hardly use it since I have a wireless remote ( NaviPod ) . Looks like it has been designed to work well with the Apple iPod carrying case . This is because , with the Apple case , there is no way to access the iPod controls when the iPods is inside the case . This remote has all the controls ( except that we can't see the display ) , and a hold button on the side . It also has a simple clip to fasten it to your clothes . If your habit is to put a long playlist and play it while jogging , working out etc . , this remote could be useful .  
2	  purchased this item and received it rather quickly , installed and passed all memtest checks , had some issues getting it to run with the other 2 gig matched pair i had installed but with some tinkering with the timings everything worked out fine and is running smooth . definitely a graet purchase especially at the price , would have picked up more if it was available .  
2	  At night . Whoever said this had an ugly casing was right . Lights in weird places , those neon or cold cathode tubes with the pink glow . Beyond that it 's your average external drive with FireWire 400 and USB HS capabilities . Besides a drive experience that 's given me the heebies , I 'm still a dedicated Western Digital fan because all of their other products besides the WD2500 have been nice to me . And since this is essentially a different model I have yet to see any hiccups . I 've thrown everything at it . Video , music , conversion to NTFS , mass copying and moving from one drive to this . And this is within the last week . I 'll give you an update when 3 months are passed or if it has any problems . UPDATE : Still going strong . I 'm using the FireWire side of it now because I 've heard that 's faster than USB High Speed even though USBHS is 480Mbps and FireWire is 400Mbps becuase it doesn't rely on the computer 's CPU to move data or something ( less resource dependence ) . I can't tell the difference so I 've just left it connected to FireWire .  
1	  My iTrip didn't do anything for me for the following two reasons : 1 ) The charger doesn't charge the iPod nano and still drains down its battery . 2 ) It 's nearly impossible to find an empty slot on the FM spectrum . Neighboring stations are always breaking through and adding noise . I bought a car charger ( in this case I bought the Sony one through Amazon ; no opinion on the other brands ) and the sound output is so spectacular compared to the iTrip . Very good thing that my car is equipped with a cassette player !  
2	  The WorkCentre has an excelent ADF . Although the price is a little bit high , it did worth ! . Congratulations to Xerox .  
1	  This is the worst printer I have ever owned . I had just set it up and was given the " E2 " error , which means it needs paper , long behold , it won't feed the paper . It won't do anything actually . Just flashes the same error , that 's all it ever does actually . Worst . Printer . Ever .  
1	  I was disappointed to learn after I received the product that it was not compatible with Windows 7 , rendering it useless to me . Others have encountered the same problem and have posted comments that there is no way to rectify this predicament .  
2	  Had trouble finding audio CDRW in major electronic stores . No problem finding with Amazon .  
1	  After two months it just keeps overheating ! Filter is clean but constantly shuts off . I have very short thin hair and this hair dryer has to cool down at a minimum of three times before I can dry my hair . Not very powerful , a waist of money and another item sent to the land fill .  
1	  It took me ages to get this product set up , the set up modules are cumbersome and didn't work out of the box . If you are not savvy around configuring TCP / IP services on your home or small office router choose something else !  
1	  We ordered this DVD player for two reasons : the trust we had in Toshiba products ( we own some others ) and the great online price . The first night after installation it seemed to work fine . The next morning it played the kid ? s DVD ? no problem . But the following night the Toshiba ? s performance took a nosedive ! The remote control became non-responsive . How can you watch TV in bed without a remote ? We gave it a second chance and tried to use to the buttons on the front control panel . They stopped working , too ! THEN the carousel made a loud , ugly noise and began functioning intermittently . The machine struggled to play regular CD 's , which was very disappointing since we also own a 3-year-old inexpensive model DVD player that plays CD ? s flawlessly . Only 24 hours after installation we packed it up to return it ! We won ? t give up on Toshiba products completely because of this experience , but we will be more cautious with the next purchase .  
1	  This blu-ray worked fine for a couple months . Now it is the most frustrating piece of crap I own . I would have expected a knock-off brand to perform like this . Samsung took a big hit on credibilty with me by making such a piece of junk . The blu-ray freezes at some point during the movie , every time , even with brand new movies . You have to completely reboot the machine and fast forward to get back where you were . Do yourself a favor and do not buy this . I will probably not buy a Samsung blu-ray again because of how aweful this one is ..  
2	  Prior to my purchare I did about 2 weeks worth of research . I connected the Z680s via an optical cable to a Sound Blaster Audigy 2 Platinum sound card and the results are amazing . You can only use optical cable if your sound card has an optical I / O. The quality of sound that is produced by these speakers is so clear , I hear an amazing assortment of details that I would not normally notice . I do notice a hiss when the speakers are idle , it 's the same sound you hear when you turn any speaker set way up no sound being produced . The hiss is really not a very big concern though and not noticeable when the speakers are speaking . The down side is ; these speakers with a good sound card are ahead of thier time . The quality of CDs and most music production is at a lower quality than what something like this can do . I have a sample DVD-audio disc and the difference between old CDs and DVD-audio is HUGE ! Do the research , and take a good look at your sound card or your X-box or whatever it is you are using them for . Don't buy the Z680s unless you have a system that can fully support the effects the Z680s can produce . Do that , and you will not be dissapointed .  
1	  Bought my first FS105 on 5/28/2012 from Amazon . It died several days later . That time , Amazon replaced it including return postage on 6/7/2012 . OK , I expect a dud once in awhile . However , this morning , 9/23/2012 , less than 4 months later , the replacement died . Completely . Disappointed in the NETGEAR brand . Please be aware that in keeping with the instructions , it is not in direct sunlight , not near a heater or heat source , and is in an open area where it gets plenty of ventilation and is climate controlled . It sits flat on a table , nothing on top or under it to heat up . So I can't think of anything that I have done to cause the problem . It was good while it lasted . I didn't overwork it ; I simply wanted to connect my laptop and my desktop to my DSL Ethernet connection . The laptop is always connected ; the desktop only occasionally . Last night it was working fine , this morning , nada . Amazon 's solution is for me to pay return postage , and they will issue a " partial " refund in an unnamed amount . I suspect that the partial refund won't even cover the cost of return postage . Guess some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed ! I sent email " feedback " to NETGEAR , since they don't provide any other options on their website . Their web forms would not accept a phone call or support , don't know why . I don't have high hopes for any assistance from them . Just wanted to let potential buyers aware of my bad experience . Lots of folks seem happy with this product , but I wonder how many of them will feel the same after 6 months or a year . Good luck everyone ! Update : 9/28/2012 I emailed NETGEAR about a week ago and explained what happened with their product , asking what recourse I had . I got 7 ( SEVEN ! ) emails back , stating that they had received my email and / or it was " referred " to such and such a department for handling . Then I got one expressing sorrow that my claim had been handled badly ( Gee , I didn't see that they had handled it at all ! ) and would I fill out a survey so they could improve for their customers ! What about helping this one ! ? The seventh email was a REMINDER to fill out the survey . Give me a break ! Guess I just have to laugh . Draw your own conclusions .  
1	  I remember when " The Secret History " was published . The novel attracted a huge amount of press , not least because of a bidding war which had developed between publishing houses and movie producers for the respective rights . I seem to remember that , when the dust cleared , Donna Tartt found herself richer by about 8 Million bucks ! I went and bought a copy and found it , well .. okay . A pretty good story , but not a lot of fun to read and devoid of likeable characters . Now I have ploughed two thirds of the way through " The Little Friend " and , oh dear , it 's hard work . The book starts off with so much promise , commencing with the inexplicable murder of nine year old Robin , his family 's favourite . We then move to a point in time 12 years later and learn of the many sad , strange effects that Robin 's unsolved murder has had on his family . We meet Harriet , Robin 's baby sister and the protagonist of the story , and learn of her decision to find out who killed her brother and avenge his death . Everything looks good . We 're getting ready for a good read . However , once the stage is set , the " plot " just wanders listlessly through page after page of hot Mississippi summer days . The characters are well drawn and the dialogue is genuine and believable , but the story just doesn't move . It 's not that nothing happens , it 's that nothing much happens , and the action is always utterly secondary to long descriptions of the thoughts and feelings of the central characters . Like another reviewer , I don't see anything wrong with resolving plot lines . It wouldn't have lowered the tone of this book at all to answer its two main questions , i.e. who killed Robin and why ? And don't tell me I am missing the point and that those questions are secondary . The book is built around those questions ! Lastly , a comment on the edition of this book that I bought . I purchased the standard paperback at a national chain . The print is too fine and the margins are so narrow that the last two words of each line on the left-hand page dissappear down into the inner crease of the spine . I am constantly bending the book backwards trying to read the end of each line . The frustrating format has further lowered the enjoyment factor of a book that can little stand it .  
2	  Based on Kinston branded D328SM-75 chips , rated CL3 but runs stable CL2 @ 133 MHz on a ECS K7S5AL . Doesn't get hot , chips on one side only ( 256 Mbit chips ) . + 5 from me .  
1	  This item worked great for the one month it worked . I 'm now waiting for a replacement because Iomega determined the equipment to be defective . I sneaked a peek inside before shipping it out and saw the hard drive inside is actually a Seagate . Maybe I 'll steer clear of both brands from now on .  
2	  I highly recommend this unit . I purchased this to push my 2 10 " subwoofers and boy do they . Very easy to hook up but you will have to adjust it on the side to get the sound that you are looking for . This unit is a great buy and so far I am very pleased with my purchase .  
1	  Judging by the other user comments , I guess some people are lucky and don't have a problem with this router . I am not one of them . It worked great when it actually worked properly , but I found the proformance to be inconsistent and the router often dropped packets . Their tech help is in India so you have to wait about an hour to get through and then the help , although friendly , was difficult to understand . I ended up calling three times and finally felt I had wasted enough time on the phone with them and sent it back for a refund . Life is to short to spend holding on the phone . I can not recommend this product if you need a reliable connection . I guess if you are not online too much then it will suffice , but if you work from home and absolutely need it to work everytime , don't count on it .  
2	  this is the first wireless n product I 've owned , so I really have no basis to compare against except my older linksys 10/100 router with a linksys wireless G access point . One big noticeable difference is the wifi speed of the wireless n to my television which has a wifi n adapter , it is fast enough to view HD streaming easily . However , with this particular product , the wifi tends to drop probably 2-3 times a week , which means I must log and reboot the device or manually unplug the power to restart it . One feature I liked on the linksys access point was that wifi devices could be placed on a MAC access list while those on the LAN could be connected freely , the D-Link doesn't seem to segregate the LAN and wifi devices , if you want a MAC access control feature enabled , you must list all wifi devices as well as your regular LAN devices .  
2	  Monster Cable makes very high quality cables , but at premier price ; however , that 's why it 's so great to find these type of sellers who have new Monster Cable products at such a reasonable purchase price . The product was as described and works perfectly for my AppleTV device to my HDTV !  
1	  They gave me this DVD Recorder after it was returned by the previous customer . The previous customer 's invoice was still inside and the unit had scratches and was repacked poorly . I returned it - the unit you get may be the one I returned .  
2	  This is great ! I kept it on its base when I wasn't using it as per its instructions and it had excellent heat and ironed beautifully . The water holder gave me plenty of steam and I didn't have to refill it for the ironing I did . The best part , of course , was the ease of using the iron without the cord . Wonderful ! I can never go back to an iron with a cord .  
2	  I was about to buy a cable from dell for a dell printer . costed $ compared to this one . Thanks Amazon !  
1	  Despite the reviews I decided to try it ( my luck ) out . The one I got had orange sticker with null modem printed on top . Guess what , it is just a mislabeled gender changer . I even checked with a multimeter . Do not waste your time on this unless you want a gender changer .  
1	  I 've really enjoyed this printer the first year . But just after that I 've had the same problems that the other negative reviewers have mentioned . Apparently the ink dries and clogs up the heads and then you 're out of luck . I 've gone through the self clean steps several times and it hasn't helped at all . I could probably take it to get repaired but it would cost $ 100 . That 's just about what I spent for this piece of junk . I 'd like to hear from the positive reviewers after they 've owned this for 12 months . Bottom line - I know these are priced to sell but DO NOT BUY .  
2	  I 've used Digital Betacam that isn't as nice as this puppy . Recently shot behind-the-scenes at an Indy Racing League event , and this camera easily kept up with the 220 + racecars . I can't say enough nice things about this camera ! The only negative .. I think it could be a little more comfortable to shoot with . Get a better shoulder brace or the balanced audio input , the Balanced Audio adaptor makes a better shoulder pad than the standard one .. and gives you better sound quality to boot ! That 's saying a bunch cause the standard mic is pretty damn fine !  
1	  I bought two sets of 2 speakers so I could add them to my patio and am disappointed . I have 2 of the four that have crackling going on in background after just a few weeks of use . These speakers cannot do stereo sound . Considering you receive 2 in a package you would think that they can be mono / stereo as a choice but no . The remote is nice and either remote works on all four speakers I bought so they are interchangable . The unit cannot be turned on by the remote , it can only be controlled by remote after manual power on button has been pressed which is annoying . If I had a choice now I would have chosen different outside speakers . They do have good sound as long as you do not turn the volumn up very high since they will start bust speaker easily .  
2	  Okay , I admit it , I was stumped at first . I could not for the life of me figure out how to connect the coax to this thing . There 's a plastic attachment with a y lead to the antenna , and presumably the coax connects at the other end of it .. but the coax did not ' fit ' . Everyone has been saying how fragile that part is , so I did not want to break anything .. and I did not find the " According to the sketch map , to join the signal line and cover the waterproof " instructions to be very clear ! Here 's the answer . The plastic attachment at the opposite end of the Y connector to the antenna is .. REMOVABLE . I had already figured out that it was ' moveable ' ( you have to slide it out of the holder to get it out of the way in order to screw in the bolt to attach the " director " to the " reflector " .. but once everything is attached , you also HAVE TO REMOVE the end piece before you can attach the coax . It twists off to reveal the coax connector beneath . Now I realize this may be extremely obvious to some of you , but it sure had me going " hmm " for a few minutes , mainly because I didn't want to break anything or be too rough with it , given all the warnings . ( My antenna seems sturdy enough , though I noticed that a few of the spacers were bent ) . Oh , one more caution - a previous reviewer had some cable info backwards , which was a bit confusing . Standard coax has a male connector , and the antenna connector ( once you find it hidden under that part I told you to remove ) is female . The review said the opposite , which had me thinking I needed to add an adapter but regular cable works fine . I will return with an update after I get the signal going , but for now .. this may help some of you who are as mystified as I was about how to connect the coax . Update : Well , that was easy ! It 's picking up 20 stations in the metro area and I 'm surprised to see that the public television station from around 40 miles away is also showing up - that one has always been spotty in this location . VHF analog is fuzzy but somewhat usable via my hybrid tuner .. they will be gone by February anyway , so that 's not an issue of concern , but it does call into question whether the VHF reception is as good as you might need for a digital VHF broadcast . I don't think we have any of those around here , yet , so I can't test that . The signal to my computer ( via usb tuner ) seems excellent - I have it on my window sill at the moment - perhaps setting it up higher may reach a little further , but this is certainly acceptable . I 'm surrounded by other buildings so there are times when OTA reception can be bad - I 'm very pleased with this so far , and think it will be better than previous antenna ( Zenith ) which I had to adjust directionally to pick up certain stations . The Eagle seems to bring them in without moving the antenna , which is great for setting recordings when you 're not home to ' adjust ' the antenna . I will say that when I first did an exhaustive channel scan using EyeTV , it only picked up ONE station when I previously had tuned in around 14 . That kind of threw me , but I redid the scan for the lower band ( non exhaustive search up to about channel 80 ) and it locked onto 20 channels . I 'd give it about 4 1/2 stars if that were possible , but since that isn't an option , I 'll stick with 4 and say , " Recommended ! " Much better than fiddling around with a ' directional ' antenna !  
1	  I 'm on my 3rd day with the Riot . It quit the second morning ; locked up solid . The power switch wouldn't turn it off . Thishappened after trying to play different tracks . It only had5 albums on it ! I left it to run down the battery , but thatdidn't help . Still locked solid . I was able to reset it with a paper clip in the reset hole onthe back . I then took Rio 's advice to delete the bad tracks ( why bad , I don't know - they 're fine on the PC ) . However , that is hard to do , since after the player flags a track asunplayable , it removes it from the playlist so you can't findout what it was . Plus , you have to navigate to other menusto do the deleting . I ended up wiping the unit , so I canstart over . But , I forgot the very special USB cable , so Icouldn't do it at work today . One more try at this , and then I 'm going to give up . Rightnow I don't think this product was ready for release . I 'll give some of my likes and dislikes , aside from thefact that it doesn't work ! Also , this is based on verylittle actual time with the unit operating . Good points :* size isn't really an issue for me . It 's big , but OK . * user interface seems OK , but I only had two hours ! Down side :* the backlight can only be set to be fully off , or to beon for a period of time after you press any button . BUT , when I have it set , and I press a button , the whole displaybecomes unreadable to me while the light is on . Didn'ttry it in the dark . I think this is going to be useless , or worse . * they have lots of warnings about not sticking the powerplug in the headphone hole . They are about one / half inchapart , and similar . Is this bad design or what ? I keep buying new products , and always say that you shouldwait until the bugs get worked out . That definitely seemsto be the case here .  
2	  I bought this camera around 2 years ago and I am still very happy with it ! It takes great pictures consistently both close up and far . Surprisingly I also really like the Kodak Easyshare software that comes with the camera for minor changes to the picture . I have found this to be one of the best digital camera 's I have seen . The only con to me is that it does have a tendency to suck batteries dry fairly quickly .  
1	  I bought the camcorder for my grandson as a Christmas present . He didn't get a chance to use it because the battery wouldn't charge . It was returned in exchange for a gift card .  
1	  I bought these to help with my macro scale photography for a Canon 7D with the 15-85mm lens . The lower end 1-2 magnification really have very little effect - you can tell this simply by holding it up and looking through it as you would a magnifying glass . The 4x lens has better magnification but the camera just couldn't focus through it at all so I ended up returning these . Thanks Amazon .  
1	  The keyboard is not bad , but I expected a little more for the price . The mouse doesn't always respond well . Sometimes it works perfectly , other times it doesn't move in the direction I want-although it only happens if I try and move it quickly . The keys on the board are rather resistive for a keyboard , so that takes some getting used to . Next is the size , I wasn't fooled by this because I checked the dimensions before I purchased the item , however " mini " is not a term I would apply to this product . It is the size of a laptop keyboard ( one without the number pad ) , and the footprint is only a couple inches less then a normal computer . Lastly the wireless , this seems to be working perfectly . I 'm about ten feet from the computer and the device operates without failure . All in all it makes for a decent HTPC keyboard / mouse combo . It gets the job done , but it isn't exactly spectacular . If you aren't buying this for an HTPC or a similar computer , don't get it . UPDATE : After using for time I 'd like to clarify some things from above . Particularly the part about the stiff keys . They are wretched and unresponsive . I have to slow my typing down and pound on the keys just to cut the number of failed to fully push down typos , otherwise it is about one every other word .  
2	  As good as other Lithium Ion Batteries that are bought at stores , but at only a fraction of the price .  
2	  Well it is my time to say how good or bad . Well first auto focus is fast , 3.5 is bright enough , 4.5 is faster than the kit lens . Image quality is great all through the focal length , super sharp at 60 to 90 mm with tripod . I got this for my E510 at Cameta Camera for only $ 129 . I was worried to get this from Cameta Camera because of the price but after a few weeks of wondering I just bought it from them . It came well packed with front & rear caps + lens hood in good bubble wrap , thanks Cameta Camera I will buy from you again . Soon I will get the 70 to 300mm . Factory demo EXCELLENT CONDITION . Works like new I have photo to prove it . PROSFast auto focusVery sharp imagesLarge hood for blocking excess lightReasonable weight ( Metal mount ) better than hard plasticSmooth & firm zoom . CONSNot so good in low light conditions & nightFront barrel rotates for focus not good for circular polarizedMinimum focus distance too long 1.5m . Over all a wise choice and must have lens , with Olympus Cameras IS system I wouldn't worry too much about a tripod for daytime use .  
2	  Amazon has great deals on this product - we use it in our DVD camcorder and it works great .  
2	  I have been impressed with the Transcend brand . Their cards are cheap , fast , and so far seem very reliable . I 'm currently using an 8 GB unit in both my iPAQ PDA and my Sony SD1000 .  
2	  These radios work well . You just have to take the advertised distance with a grain of salt . In real life conditions , the range is nothing close to 26 miles . It is more like a few miles .  
1	  I bought the power box because of the mp3 capability but every cd with mp3s that I put in skipped songs , or would not recognize songs on the cd . I would use new cds and that did not help either . The sound is very highs oriented with no bass at all . The GFI is a nice feature but what I really want is a work radio that functions as a radio and can last a little . When out of the box there are malfunctions with the MP3 capability there is a problem . So I turn on the radio to find that there is no reception . Very bad very bad !  
2	  My speakers sounded a little under-powered to me coming straight from the head unit , but I didn't really want to get an amp . My car has a 1.5 din sized hole so when I saw this thing for fairly cheap I decided to try it out . It definitely gave me that boost in power and clarity that I was looking for , and the 7-band eq gives you a lot more control over the sound than the usual 3 band in your head unit . I wish they had provided the RMS power of this thing , the only number i could find was the peak 200W . Even so I 'm happy with the sound I 'm getting from it .  
2	  The Vantec NexStar GX 3.5 USB External Hard Drive Enclosure is all that was advertised . Easy to install you hard drive and the built-in USB 2 . Hub is really a plus . Works really well and the internal fan helps to keep the Hard Drive cool .  
2	  I 've upgraded my rating from 2 to 4 . It turns out " Take Two 5.0 " was the primary culprit with the slow boot and was the sole offender for the need to have a zip disk inserted to start Windows 2000 at all . Anyone using Roxio 's Easy CD Creator Platinum 5.0 that installed Take Two should visit the [ website ] to download and install the 5.01 and 5.01s updates ! I also found that once I unplugged my 3Com HomeConnect PC camera from my Entrega 4 port usb hub , I didn't stay on the boot screen for 10 minutes . Time to dump Entrega and find newer , higher-powered hubs , I guess .  
2	  I bought one of these for myself and was happy with it , until my daughter started swiping it for herself ! So I ordered one for her . Unfortunately , it arrived broken . I contacted the seller about returning it , and he not only apolgized , but insisted on sending a new one without even having me send the broken one back to him . The next one arrived quickly and undamaged . The item is great and the seller is a pleasure to work with - great combination !  
1	  I ordered this tripod and when it came I was so disappointed that I sent it back immediately . The neoprene made my hands itch . It wasn't level when I put my camera on it . It angered me so much that I bought a carbon fiber tripod and magnesium head from the good people at Slik in the same hour . Although it was of poor quality for my use I would still say it would be good for someone who is just starting out in photography . I give it a low rating partly because I was being cheap and I should have went for the carbon fiber in the first place .  
2	  Great product . A step-up ring is a must ; it allows you purchase less filters for your different size lenses . I recommend this product .  
2	  Samsung ML-2010 Toner reviewWhen I ordered this product , I was originally a little concerned about getting the right toner cartridge for my Samsung printer . I saved all of my online receipt info , just in case , because the price was so attractive . No other office supply store in town could come within double the price we paid . We ordered from Eforcity on April 1st , had the exact toner in place the next week as promised for the cheap shipping ( which I always love ) . The total price with shipping was less than what I would pay locally . This will be my toner source for now . Need the extra money for gas & food nowadays ..  
1	  This was an OK unit until I updated the map and firmware from a disk I purchased from MIO . First of all I was very surprised to find the ' Update ' on the disk has 2007 maps on it even thought we are in 2009 . Not 1 road changed in this software that I have seen yet . The other major problem that started happening is the unit now reboots whenever it feels like it . I have spoken 3 times with customer service and all I get is " Send it in for $ 80 to have it fixed " . So I am supposed to pay for their bad programming .. I don't think so . The last two calls I made I was told they are forwarding my request to management . Well they told me that 3 weeks ago , and I never got a returned call . If I were you I would stay away from MIO until they can get better customer service . I know my next GPS will probably be a Garmin , I hear there Customer Service is good .  
2	  This has been a life saver . It makes it so I don't have to get another device that can accept many different sizes of memory cards .  
1	  The quality of the pictures were great . But then , after 13 months , the camera became dead . Battery is ok . But , for whatever reason , camera is dead . It feels like the camera is programmed to die after the warranty is over so that you will have to buy another camera .  
1	  Given that this DVD player was priced at $ 30 , I didn't expect it to impress me , but I did expect that it would work on a basic level . After initially plugging it in , the disc drawer would not open . After power cycling it a few times it did open , but would not recognize any of the discs I inserted . All were normal unscratched DVDs . After power cycling the unit a few more times it did eventually play a DVD properly , but it also demonstrated that it would never behave reliably and repeated plugging and unplugging would be the norm with this DVD player . I hope that all of Coby 's entry level units are not this poor . I give it two stars only because this unit could be coaxed into operation with enough perseverance .  
1	  The router set up easy and worked fine . The card on the other hand was junk . I installed the drivers and it caused an error . I called customer noservice and got someone from India and could not hardly understand . He told me what to do and it still did not work . I called back the next day and after about two hours of trying to fix ( understand bad english ) they said it was bad . I bought a belkin router and card . It has worked perfect for almost two months now  
1	  I want a multi-purpose faster ( with some zoom ) lens for my Canon XS to replace KIT lens and do not want to spend a fortune . I want faster lens as I want to capture my little ones actions without using flash , and kit lens is no good for that . I know 50mm prime is great , but on APS-C it is equivalent to 80mm , and not usable indoor because of close quarters many times . I want atleast 35mm to start with . Though not veryfast , Lenses those match my requirement are Tamron 17-50 f2.8 and Sigma 18-50 f2.8 within my price range . Good , I got the lens from local retailer so that I can exchange if required , though I have to drive almost 50miles roundtrip to the store . It felt good in hand , much heavier than KIT lense , built is good . Hmm , pretty much all the photos are out of focus , some are okay . None of those are correctly in focus and I was comparing to Canon Kit lens with IS . Kit lens was much sharper . And another kicker , it was struggling to focus in low-light where KIT lens has absolutely no problem focussing in all Zoom ranges . Anyways since it is a bad copy , I drove again , spend almost 3 hour for getting a replacement . I was really hoping I would get a good copy . Oh , boy , again same BS . All photos soft . Then I started experiment with manual focus , and picture are tack sharp , and ofcourse as I expected the photos taken by Tamron are better than KIT lens , and I could use faster shutter speed . Manual focus ring is not good , I have rotate it very slowly / precisely to adjust focus . In further testing , I used liveview ( QuickView Mode ) focussed with auto-focus ( I was using ZoomView on XS LCD ) , then slide it manual mode , then adjusted focus ( slightly turn focus ring to clockwise ) ( Front focus issue ) . Now , it is tack sharp . For the kit lens , there is absolutely no issue . I took several photo where I have lot of fine text on Box in very good lighting with Auto and Manual mode , Auto Mode always Front Focussed . And to their credit it seem this second copy was not struggling to Focus that much in low-light ( still not as good as KIT lens ) . But two copies later , 100 miles drive , 20 + hours of time spend over a week , I end up with nothing . Now , I need to drive back to return it , another 50 miles . In my opinion this ridiculous . Quality control at Tamron seems to be worst than one those cheap chainese toys . One would expect out of two brand new lenses atleast one would be good . As much as I want to love this lens , this is completely un-acceptable . I wonder how-many people really got a good copy the first time itself . It seems only 1 in 3 to 5 , gets a good copy . Anyways , now I am tired , I just want to return it and forget about it . May be when I have too much time on my hand I may experiment with some other lenses . It is possible this is a specific batch issue , and if anyone cares , lens serial starts with 4000 . But bottom line countless hours are wasted and a frustating experience . And Caution : I gave 1 star , but suddenly when I came back to edit something it took two stars ! ? whats up ? NOTE : I used tripod to test focus issues in good lighting . Update : 01/06/2008 : Anyways I went ahead and bought this lens from another local retailer . This copy did not have focus issues at all . But some how it has too much CA , and lens itself is producing much more softer images ( more so than the one Front Focusing ) . It also has more red tinge to the images . I tried comparing with Kit lens at F3.5 , F 5.6 with exactly same settings , and kit lens is always sharper . So 3 copies , first one Focus issues , 2nd front focussing , 3rd very soft images . Guess what I gave up .  
1	  I 'm VERY disappointed in the sound quality of these ! I bought these as a back up set for my iPhone earbuds . Many reviews on Amazon ( and elsewhere ) said that they were at least as good sounding as the stock iPhone / Ipod sets . This is just not true . One of the things Apple is great about is having a certain quality standard . Being somewhat of an audiophile , I can tell you that the Apple earbuds are a very good base standard for general listening quality . Don't get me wrong , there better sounding headphones and earphones / earbuds out there . But in my experience there are not that many " great values " to be had : YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR ! ( i.e. My Shure E3s sound way better than the standard Ipod issue , but at $ 179 they certainly should ! ) Anyway , as far as these Rivet lanyard style iPhone compatible earphones are concerned , I was intrigued by their lanyard design , as well as the fact that they had a cloth covered cord ; a characteristic of some " high-end " audio cables . I love in-ear style earbuds and already own two pair of Shure ear monitors ( the older E1 and the aforementioned set of the E3s ) . There seemed to be more than a few good reviews . Some of the negitive reviews I read seemed to be written by folks who just had an unlucky experience or just didn't seem to know any better . So being an educated consumer , I seized the chance to get them on sale when Amazon lowered the price to $ 9.44 . " What a bargain ! " I thought ; the original price was $ 29.99 ( incidentally the exact same price as Apple 's stock iPhone / Ipod replacement headsets ) . Many of the other quality after-market brands of iPhone compatible earbuds are priced $ 90 and up . So , with shipping my total was about $ 15 . But when I tried these Rivet earphones for the first time , I felt as though I 'd thrown $ 15 right in the trash . They have a very narrow , thin sound that I would expect from set of free airline headsets , or earphones that you 'd find at an " All for a Dollar " store . The cloth covered cord causes distracting " rustling " sounds that transmit right to your ears ; VERY DISTRACTING ! So much for the " quality " of the cloth covered cable . .. and good luck trying to talk on the phone with these , no way ! The cord rustling would require you to stand perfectly still in order to hear the caller . Well , at best it can be said that opinions about headphones are very personal . You really have to try them to be sure , and that 's hard to do . But please take it from me , if you care about sound quality ( even a little bit ) these are not for you !  
1	  I purchased my Replay 5080 in late December 2002 . Initial setup was a breeze . However , the problems soon started . I was unable to speak to any human in technical support until early Jan . 2003 . I think the entire company closed for the holidays . After speaking to multiple support reps , my machine worked for 2 more weeks . The next " glitch " was in the software . They were aware of the problem , but did not have an answer . I shipped the unit back ( at MY expense ) and received a refurbished unit within 10 days . This unit worked for all of 3 weeks . It froze and no support suggestions could get it running . This time it took a week and multiple calls to get a supervisor to OK the return . ( At least they sent an airbill this time to pay for the return ) . I am still waiting for my 3rd unit . This is their last chance . I would not suggest buying Replay TV until they figure out how to make their units a little more reliable . I feel I know more about fixing this product than some of their tech support staff .  
1	  Sound quality is good enough for the price . Isolation is okay , but not as good as Shures . Despite its good features , I cannot get over its problem - wires break VERY easily . Since these don't come with bags like the Shures , I couldn't keep them in perfect condition , but I certainly never abused them . Nevertheless , I 've had wires break TWICE , and it seems to be a pattern ; I also saw complaints online about this issue so I 'm not alone . While cheap earphones are nice , I 'd rather have one that lasts . Shures , although expensive , are completely worth the price difference for their superior isolation , better build quality , and the protective equipment that comes with it . So in conclusion , I will never buy Sennheiser 's cheap earphones again .  
2	  Just received my microwave popcorn popper last weekend and wanted to chime in - albeit early - on what I 've found so far . Of the 4 or so batches I 've made , it takes about 2 minutes , 30 seconds in MY microwave ( YMMV ) . I 'm not sure I understand , like , or care for the little paper " concentrator " thingies , because I believe a product like this should NOT come with disposable ( and required to replace ) parts , but so far , it cooks 99 % of the kernels I put in it , and the popcorn comes out great ( for a non-oil type popper ) . I 'm trying to be a little healthier , so I don't use oil . I also have the other type of air popper which is basically like putting kernels into a hair dryer , but with this microwave popper , because of the steaming aspect of the bowl itself , the resulting popcorn isn't dry and so far , at 2.5 minutes , hasn't scorched . Also , unlike the " hair dryer " style air popper , unpopped kernels don't fly all over the kitchen . In short , aside from having to occassionally replace the " concentrator " paper parts which irks me , the Presto PowerPop Microwave Popper does exactly what it says and considering there 's only one bowl to clean ( the popper itself ) , I like it ..  
1	  If you want to know exactly where you are , this is a great toy . If you want to figure out where you are going , this is useless . I expected the GPS to be able to offer advanced features similar to what we have come to expect with GPS 's built in to cars , or map websites on the internet ( turn by turn directions ) . Or at least directions . Or at least finding addresses . This was a disappointment , even with Garmin 's map cds . The fun part ? I purchased some topographical map software from a different vendor . Uploaded the waypoints from my garmin .. and I could follow my mountain expeditions all over the topo maps . That was kinda fun . Also , then the other way , in the mountains the GPS kept me pointed in the right directions . Also , carrying it running keeps track of how far you run much more accurately then those pedometers , and keeps track of speed . Ever wonder what you are flying over on those long flights over middle America ? Turning this on in an airplane is kinda fun .  
2	  Strengths : Easy to keep charged . Lets me compensate without turning the TV up loud . Convenient , as placing the device back in the charger keeps me from misplacing it . Replacement silicone earpieces are great . Easily lasts a listening day on single charge . Weaknesses : Earpieces it is supplied with made my ears sweat and were expensive to replace . When I eat or read or use laptop while listening , it is difficult to stay out of the way of the infrared beams that make the device work . The weight of the power and audio cords in the back of the little transmitter box tend to drag it back across the top of the TV set , making me have to reposition the box frequently . There is no balance control or mono switch for those who have lost hearing in one ear or who have large imbalance of hearing loss . Comments : The last weakness I 've shown is actually the most important one . I lost hearing almost completely and suddenly from perfect hearing a few years ago . This device allows me to overcome the resulting tinnitus in that ear by supplying louder TV sound to the other ear , which still hears fine . My brain modulates the tinnitus when I hear sounds coming in the " bad " ear , so not having ability to make stereo into mono and channel all into the other ear is a weakness for me . For those with bilateral hearing loss , there is no difficulty with the device . I overcame this by wiring up an adapter sending both channels into my other ear and nothing into the " bad " one . The silicone earpieces are easily obtained and last for an indefinite period . I 've already had mine almost a year . Do NOT remove the fiber ones until you are ready to replace them , as they are a one-use item . You cannot replace them on the earpieces once you pull them off . I liked the my first " 2.3 MHz " unit so much that I obtained an additional one for my computer area , freeing me to move about while I listen to audio from the computer . I can listen late at night and not awaken my wife with the second unit . I noticed that the original ( 95 kHz ) unit is still being sold by Amazon . But it mentions in the text : " This system is not recommended for plasma or LCD screen televisions . " AHA ! Get the 2.3 MHz system if you have a modern TV or you will hear a VERY annoying BUZZ from the flat-screen TV or computer monitor . Unfortunately , THAT older system has a balance control , which the company dropped from the newer model for some reason .  
2	  I bought these for myself last Christmas .. and I love them ! very tiny and inconspicuous . Nice sound quality , as well .  
2	  I really like the hardware itself , it works well . The software however isn't that great . When you can get good reception of a channel the picture looks fantastic . It does beat on the CPU pretty hard on a 2 GHz Athlon XP machine , so make sure your computer has the recommended horsepower to use it .  
1	  I purchased two sets of pyle PLG6C component speakers and hooked them up to a kenwood 150x2 amp . System sounded good for about a day and a half and then the tweeters started blowing left and right . I checked the X-overs and they were fine , I then preformed a resistance check with my ohm meter and all 4 tweeters tested out of limits . Diagnois 4 blown tweeters ! I contacted PYLE ( the name says it all ) and they wanted me to send the blown tweeters back and pay for shipping both ways = $ 30.00 Why just so i could blow them again ? Screw that . So much For the 200 Watt RMS power rating . Probably ok to run just off the recievers power but if you plan on running an external amp forget it .  
1	  5 reasons why I hate EPSON1 . I can't figure out why the print quality is so poor when I print from the computer to the printer ( I have a macbook pro , MAC OSX 10.4.11 and am trying to print photos stored in iPhoto and Photoshop Elements 4.0 ) , it 's something with the settings , because I have called tech support before and they walked me through it successfully the last time I tried to print photos a few months ago ( don't I wish I had taken better notes ) 2 . There is no toll free number to call tech support , so yes , you have to pay for the call yourself , use up your cell minutes , whatever . 3 . Tech Support won't go " off script " or skip ahead . After 35 agonizing minutes of walking me through the script ( " unplug the printer .. do a print nozzle check , now do it again , and let 's just do it one more time .. or else I ( the so called tech support ) will get in trouble because the line is recorded " ) I GOT DISCONNECTED JUST AS WE WERE STARTING TO TRY TO PRINT A PHOTO . 4 . Tech Support is inflexible . Of course I knew that uninstalling and reinstalling the printer driver ( which I had done 3-5 times already ) was not the answer but tech support insisted we do it again . So that took an additional 5 or 6 minutes , and I still never got the information I was looking for because we were disconnected . Is it so difficult to tell me what settings are required on the computer so I can print photo quality photos ! 5 . Tech support is only available Monday through Friday 6 am to 8 pm pacific time , which for a full time working parent of 2 kids under 3 years of age I am lucky to find time to make this kind of a call . Oh yeah , did I mention that they don't even have a toll free number so that after I got disconnected at 8:06 pm pacific , it was too late to call back so I still have my question unanswered and my photos still printing disappointingly . IF someone at EPSON reads this I hope they will consider getting a toll free number to improve customer satisfaction . OK so yes I know most of this is probably user error but it shouldn't take a rocket scientist to print a decent photo from a photo printer , nor should tech support be so costly and unhelpful .  
2	  Purchased the MPIO FL100 after considerable research and now am convinced I made the best choice for the money . Sound quality is superb . The MPIO has an innovative design and intuitive interface , plus FM , voice recording and secure digital expansion . I don't understand other reviewers complaints regarding sound - sound quality is excellent with the supplied earbuds . My only complaint is that MPIO 's makers should have had someone with better knowledge of the English language write their manual .  
1	  Yes , I bought this item as I needed more room for DVDs . Mistake ! Item not usable right the way as I have to remove excess of plastic on each pocket . The design and materials used on this item are not the same used in older variants as I expected . As a result all case is very fragile and cannot be used for transportation or frequent usage .  
1	  I picked this up with a music order for my 350d - big mistake . The class came chipped , scratched and smuged ; Tiffen filters are of very poor quality . Do yourself a favor , like I did , and find your local camera supply store and pick up an optical grade filter for maybe , oh , 10 dollars more . This Tiffen one was so bad that the scratches made their way onto some shots and ruined an entire day of shooting .  
1	  This product is not worth it . While you are able to transfer files , it only allows you to pretty much only do that . Cannot use ActiveSync .  
2	  This bag is sexy , feminine , and chic . The only problem I have is that I think it should have the carrying handles on the outside which makes it more functionable to carry and made from the faux-croc . The handles that stores inside makes this laptop bag look cheap .  
1	  Just bought this but it 's over 30 days now . New TV with Netflix dingle still drops signal . Bought a new Mac Mini and after two days trying to connect to the net , an Apple wireless professional said these " G " routers are 4 year old technology . He thinks that G does not support the new Mac Mini or other new electronics very well . Now I have to go purchase a new " N " router . I thought I did my research but I guess not enough . At least list that these old " G " routers are not the best for newer electronics .  
1	  I spent almost 2 hours with tech support trying to diagnose something that they already know .. the power supplies have a problem . My warranty expired 5 WEEKS AGO ! so I am ordering a new power supply . Hopefully this will fix it . If not , this PC will become target practice and I will not buy another Dell .  
2	  I bought this lens because I wanted perfectly blurred backgrounds behind sharp subjects . I was nervous about not being able to zoom in on a subject and I wondered if 50mm would be ample , but still I wanted the 1.4 aperture . After having had this lens for 4 months , I know I made the right decision . I am getting the most amazing , butter smooth blurred backgrounds ! Every shot amazes me ! This has become my favorite lens . I regularly get AMAZING shots of my kids , objects around the house , and upclose floral . The lack of zoom turned out not to be a problem , as I have learned to " zoom " with my feet . If you 're wanting to easily achieve beautifully blurred backgrounds and butter-smooth bokeh , this may be the lens for you . I find this lens is best for indoor and outdoor portraits .  
1	  I bought my P22FB monitor in June of 2003 . It worked fine for 11 months & then started jittering very badly . I sent it in for warranty service ( it had a 3 year warranty ) & got it back a month later , working again . Less than a year and a half later , the same problem surfaced again . I sent it back again & it has now been over 2 1/2 months & I still don't have my monitor back . Plus , Viewsonic has mistakenly shipped me TWO 17 " monitors since that time . Most of the time you can't get through to their support line at all & when you can , it usually means a 30 + minute wait . I have to assume that either their products are breaking down at very high rates or their support lines are woefully understaffed . They have been extremely unresponsive to both phone calls & email & don't seem to me to have any commitment whatsoever to customer service . I will never buy another product from them , no matter how much technical praise they may receive .  
2	  I think too many keyboards are much too fancy these days ( splits , illumination , etc . ) . This thing just works and it has a nice size to fit on a desk and not take its half out of the middle . Works well with my linux box as well except the number pad doesn't work ( probably need to map the keys ) .  
2	  I 've used Amazon to order various items before and was always satisfied with the result .. quality at low prices . I ordered a Sony Dsc G1 on Sunday June 24th and it arrived Thursday , June 28th . I 've taken about 50 photos under critical conditions , low light and using the automatic features of the camera . I 'm amazed at how well it performs . Big LCD screen , the camera is a nice size for my big hands , just a little bigger then the regular Cybershots . The resolution in the screen is excellent . I was considering the DSC T-100 but it got such bad ratings that I went with this camera .. sure glad I did ! When I figure out some of the more technical features I 'll post a more detailed review .  
1	  I read a lot of positive reviews about this , but it did nothing for my scratched iPad 2 . I spent a lot of time working on the scratches , as recommended , but it made no difference ; in fact , it actually seemed to make it look worse . I ended up putting Ghost Armor on the front to hide the scratches and prevent new ones .  
2	  These are the only VHS tapes I will buy now . After a long search to get tapes that would capture bright colors without making them appear blown out , I found TDK VHS tapes . Things I like about them : Good colorExcellent SoundMany re-records and playbacks without deteriorating . I used 1 TDK tape to record Glenn Beck every evening while I was at school last year at 5PM , at the end of the semester , it was still going strong . 1 hour record then 1 hour playback every night from August to December . Deep black , bright white , crystal clear sound . The VCR I used was a Panasonic PV-9455S on EP speed . Another great application is VHS camcorders , I have a Sharp VC-C20U and I was having difficulty capturing good video with it until I discovered these tapes . In all it 's 1986 glory , my Sharp camcorder was capturing high quality video with stereo sound just as well today as it was all those years ago .  
2	  Overall , this is a great router .. I have had some issues with the firmware , just like every other router I have owned ( from any manufacturer ) .. Yet , this unit is exceptionally stable and reliable .. Here are some comments that may not be in the mfg specPro 's + Speed is great , clocked 90mb from one wireless laptop to router to another wireless laptop ( wireless N ) + IP Reservation system - allows you to assign an IP to a device / client , while allowing them to still utilize DHCP + Dynamic DNS support through d-link or dydns + Webapp makes all of the set-up functions and administration a breeze + allows you to save a profile of all of your settings in case the router needs to be replaced or wipedCon's - Signal strength / range .. okay .. I purchased the optional antenna system and it seems to help a little .. - Tech support is slow and farmed out overseas - Firmware has several minor bugs , which are annoying until you learn to live with them .. - No central place on the webapp that shows all the connected clients ( sometimes they dont come up at all )  
2	  While this kit made the installation of an aftermarket radio very easy , there was a fair amount of difficulty in securing the DIN cage . The clips for my application mounted securely to the kit and are more than enough to secure the whole thing into the dash , but the DIN cage was difficult to secure to the kit . The tabs on the top of the radio 's DIN cage were easy to bend into place , but the jewel case pocket prevented the tabs from securing the bottom . I was finally able to create shims to place between the pocket and the cage , which virtually eliminated the looseness in the installation . Overall , the result is a look that is not as obscenely " aftermarket " as other radio installs I have seen . It places the front of the radio even with the surrounding dash panels , and in my opinion makes the aftermarket install blend into the dash better than the factory deck did . My shims bowed the top of the jewel case pocket a little , but it isn't too noticeable . In summary , the kit looks good , and holds my radio very securely , although it took a slight bit of fabrication to make it fit as secure as it does .  
2	  needed these in a pinch for a new server install with a 50 foot run that wasn't co-operating . two of these trunked at 2Gb / E working great , already have terabytes of data gone through them . they kink like any cable , so be careful when you pull . pretty sure they 're PVC jackets , so dont put them on really hot stuff ( no brainer really ) I like em ' a lot , especially at $ 15 primed each .  
2	  These headphones are what the add said they were . They fit very well & the sound is very good . They are just what I wanted .  
2	  I want to confess a painful episode in my relationship with my Klipsch computer speakers , a relationship I 've monogamously maintained since the 2 series . I should admit first to being a computer gaming psycho . I have a system that 's been featured in 2 gaming magazines in their " totally sick computer we 'd all kill for " sections . The last profile showed my Harmon Kardon receiver and a JBL 6 speaker surround configuration . For that I 'm eternally sorry . I don't know what came over me . I guess I figured that spending 5 times as much as the 5.1 system would deliver better sound , ingender deeper jealosy , command just that much more salivation when I cranked the volume . How wrong could one man be . I don't know about the special horn positioning in the Klipsch , I 'm not even too sure I understand what 400 watts really means in the grand scheme of things ; I 'm just that guy who walks into the store , says " gimme the dream system " , goes home , plugs it in and expects it to be better than what it replaced . Well , in this scenario , when I cranked up the replacement to the 5.1 , I was like " What the F @ # $ ! " . It paled in comparison . The highs weren't the shrill " crack your eardrums " highs of the 5.1 , the lows weren't the " neighbor 's have been complaining , they say they hear gunfire coming from inside your home " type lows .. Needless to say , I went back to the 5.1 . If you 're in the market for " the best " , for gaming , for MP3 listening , then you can't beat this system for the money .  
2	  I have had the battery and carrying case for about three weeks and found the case to be very light , durable , and more than adequate in size to carry any extra accessories ( cables , docking station , etc . ) . I have used the battery in place of the standard battery to insure that I will not run out of power in the middle of something important ( such as a recent wedding ceremony ) . I was not disappointed though I haven't put it to an extended test to determine total battery life . The combined offer sweetened the deal even more .  
2	  This was an amazing purchase . Didn't have to wait for shipping or anything , my brother just sent in the info and had the credits ! Very handy ! He loves his xbox points , so this was just perfect !  
1	  Had a chance to compare the new " in-ear speakers " and let me tell you , they are a complete waste of money . First off , any in-ear headphone will sound worse than those that sit over the ear . These leave no room for the sound to reverberate , and can lead to hearing loss . With the sound bouncing , much of the finer qualities can become muffled and lose meaning . There is no reason to buy these , when many comparable substitutes can be found . Plus , by buying these , you are supporting a company that bullies small businesses . Stick with a nice pair of cans from Sony , or Bose if you want to spend a ton of cash . Stick with a manufacturer that has been in the business for years , not one that uses celebrity branding to overcome shortfalls .  
2	  Exceeds expectations keeping hot liquids hot . I think the branding for Thermos ( now Thermos Nissan ( tm ) ) has been effective . I gain a small iota of comfort or perhaps nostalgia from the familiar cylindrical thermos shape sitting proudly on my desk basking in its stainless steel glow as if to say : " This is one phallus that will not fail you my friend . " The thermos is easy to use and clean .  
2	  The quality of the pictures is great . But you need to remember to enhance details on the settings when you print , while this will take on more ink , that is ok , the quality is perfect . Colors are bright and exact , while printing RGB format . It feels like the pictures are clone from the screen . I recomend this product to anybody that needs to create their own family album and not wait until the store developers have it ready . Also for postcards and invitations , where you dont want large quantities .  
1	  PROS : 1 . Solid build quality2 . Play video & MP3 ( though I haven't used these features since I bought it mainly for the GPS functionality ) 3 . Good price ( when it 's on sale and when they fix all the bugs below ) 4 . Uses NAVTEQ map dataCONS : 1 . Too thick and too heavy due to the 20gb hard drive inside2 . Too slow , everytime you try to move the map it reads the hard drive and then updates the screen , this process takes like 1-2 seconds and in computer terms it 's a life time3 . You can hear the hard drive spin up & down , kinda ennoying4 . The POI feature sucks big time , you would need to enter a state and then a city first , what if you only know the name of the restaurant and don't know exactly what city it 's in ? 5 . There 's no AC adapter , you would need to go to RadioShack and get one if you want to charge it at home and not in the car6 . It takes forever to LOCK on sat signal and this is even outdoors in the car driving , even when it locks on signal it would from time to time lose the signal , what good is a GPS navigator if there 's no signal ? 7 . It can get warm due to the hard drive8 . Update firmware requires a SD card not less than 128MB and not bigger than 512MB , nowadays people use 2GB cards so this is a big hassle9 . It doesn't display all the street names , only the one you 're driving on and if you 're lucky maybe a few other ones around your current positionIn short , this is such a waste of money but luckily I didn't buy it online and the store I bought it from has a 30-day money back return policy , I also bought the Mio C310x at the same time I bought this JVC and the Mio is such a wonderful GPS , it beats this piece-of-junk JVC in each and every category ( the mio doesn't play video unless you get the C710 ) and I paid 70 bucks less than what I paid for the JVC  
1	  Bad battery , defective , not good at all for MicroMV Cameras like SONY DCR IP5 or IP7 , go fo NPF-71 InfoLITHIUM as a replacement  
2	  This is my fist foray into wireless networking and I simply followed the suggestions of other reviewers in regards to being a Comcast customer , called them up with MAC ID and it went through without a glitch and I returned my rental modem the same evening . Getting to setting up my own secure networking profile , I encountered minor difficulties which were easily remedied by calling Motorola , unlike some of the reviews I saw here , our tech was local ( if you catch my drift , which nowadays is rare ) and helpful , shared a few tips with me on how to understand the settings under my networking profile . For ease of use , top of the line security protocols and consistency in signal strength around the home and even on separate floors , my signals never varies lower than 84 % - 97 % . I recommend highly in my humble opinion .  
2	  I was very picky when trying to find the ideal headphones for running outside and these have definitely met / exceeded my expectations . They are form fitting around my neck and with the additional " Clip " you don't even feel them when you run . Some people were complaining about pain in their ears when they were done running and I haven't experienced that at all . If you 're looking for great sounding , comfortable running headphones then I highly recommend ..  
1	  This sheets couldn't be any dryer , ergo useless . Guess I 'm going back to the liquid .. BAD BAD BAD . Apparently they do expire , and they are sending old sheets .  
2	  Bought thisTRENDnet 108Mbps Wireless Super G USB Adapter ( TEW-444UB Version V1.1R ) last fall during a Gold Box Deal , and it has served its purpose a number of times . Have been using it as a general purpose backup for notebook PCs and as test device for wireless installations , mostly where the OS is Windows 2000 / XP ( SP1 / SP2 ) , 2003 Server , or Vista . Linux is not a supported operating system , but the listed chipset for the TEW-444UB is ' Atheros AR5523 + AR2112 ' , so there may be 3rd-party Linux drivers available if one looked . This reviewer found excellent wireless connectivity with 802.11g or 802.11b networks , and also found it to be backward compatible . Was able to reach the listed 108Mbps speed under certain installations , but do remember that speed performance and coverage may vary depending on an individual network environment . If you get one of these wireless adapters , be sure to check under the white section of the packaging , where you 'll find an excellent 5-foot USB 2.0 cable . This isn't noted in the specs , and happens to be an excellent USB 2.0 extension cable . A friend got one of these and almost threw the box away without checking under the white cardboard section . Should you need longer , then thisTRENDnet USB Extender Cable ( 5m , 16.4ft ; ( male to female ) should do the job . It 's highly suggested that after you install the drivers form the included CD-ROM disc , you go to the TRENDnet Website ( see comments ) and check for any updated drivers . Installation of updated drivers will often eliminate those annoying networking issues that can ( and will ) sometimes occur . Should you need speeds higher than the 108Mbps offered , theTRENDnet 300Mbps Wireless N USB Adapter ( TEW-624UB Version 1.0R ) should fit those needs , and it works with Mac OS X v10.4 and above , which isn't supported by the modelo reviewed here . Though Vista is not listed as a recognized OS for this device , it actually is supported , and the appropriate drivers for the TEW-444UB are available for download from the TRENDnet Website ( see comments ) . The steps for installation under Windows Vista are as follows : Step 1 : On the bottom right-hand corner of the screen , right click the wireless network connection icon and select ' Connect to a network ' . Step 2 : Select the desired network and then click ' Connect ' . Step 3 : Enter the security key and then click ' Connect ' . Note : If you 're connecting to an unsecured network , click ' Connect Anyway ' . Step 4 : Click ' Close ' . Summary .. General performance : 4-stars ; functions as expectedConnectivity : 5-stars ; no issues foundInstallation : 5-stars ; very easyOverall : 5-stars ; excellent value for the money , especially if you find it at a reduced price . Adding to the value is that five-foot USB 2.0 cable that one will find under the divider . Recommended .  
2	  I held off on buying these for a while since they were so inexpensive , I couldn't imagine they worked all that well . Instead , I read some reviews and got the Sennheiser PXC 250 , which fold fantastically small for travel with good noise reduction . Big problem though : they are " on-the-ear " phones , and very uncomfortable for long periods since they push your ears into your head . I fly cross-country and internationally quite a bit , and I found I couldn't wear them for longer than 2 hours without actual pain . Noise reduction and sound quality are useless if I can't even wear the headphones ! So comfort became my # 1 criteria . I demoed the Bose Quietcomfort 3s , and they are very nice , but there 's no way I was going to spend $ 300-350 on headphones . I finally bought these , immediately put them on and wore them for over an hour , and they are incredibly comfortable for me . Noise reduction seems decent , and sound quality is good if a bit boomy on the bass . Amazon was $ 12 cheaper than Target . Very happy and difficult to beat for the price . Anyone want some PXC 250s ? :) Pros : Extremely comfortable for long periodsBattery stored inside headphone itself vs . dongle or boxBattery and airline adapters includedCons : On / Off switch hard to activate , especially when onA little bulky for airplane travel  
2	  The screen works perfectly ! If you take your laptop everywhere , this is a must have .. even going into meeting at work . It does get dusty rather quickly which just mean that you have to wipe it more . Not something to stop you from buying it !  
1	  I purchased this product about two months ago . I noticed the lack of the traditional cap-lock and num-lock indicator LEDs right away . I also noticed the very short receiver range . The last straw came yesterday when the mouse died and I had to go back to my old one to continue working . If you need to go cordless I suggest going to a better quality product . It may cost more up front but will be more reliable than this one .  
2	  Very good quality cable with the RF shield bulb built into the cable . Nice signal carry with no loss I can detect and its high speed .  
2	  I bought this 6 weeks ago , hoping that it could really do what the company 's advertising claimed . I have kept it at my side ever since , while working on a large curriculum project . I 've been using it to record bits and pieces of my research results , which come to me at times when my computers are not necessarily running , in both English and German . You can trust the claims if my experiences are typical . The hardware is sturdy , well thought out , and easy to use . Nor have I been disappointed with the scanning software for German and English . The data-storage system is genuinely intuitive and , so far , completely reliable . I store on an SD card , which I can then drop into my laptop or desktop . At the same time I have the hard copy as backup . By paginating my sheets as I write , I can find my texts on the SD instantly . Conversion from hand-writing to an . rtf file is extremely uncomplicated and fast , too . Be sure you get the software upgrade - MyNotes - from the beginning and you 'll not be disappointed . The handy notebook folder in extra , but really rounds off the package so that it is completely self-contained . I 'm glad I went for it .  
2	  I found this product and the services to be of the upmost quality . I would use this service to purchase this product again .  
1	  I purchased this product a month ago , does not work at all . Technical support was horrible , I finally decided to return it .  
2	  This is the best V-Moda earbuds out of the whole lineup . The price was just under $ 30 and the sound was like OMG when i first plug it into my ears ! I first bought the more expensive V-Moda chrome edition which cost almost 70 dollars and i thought it had to be the best because of the price . But man , was I wrong ! the look of the chrome edition was awesome but the sound was just horrible . My brother bought this one like a week later and when i tested on the same Ipod , I was blasted out of mind ! I was thinking to myself , what in the world was V-Moda thinking , a $ 60 dollar earbud that can't even compare to its lower priced $ 30 earbud ! The sound was great , the bass was high and clear , the treble was high enough but didn't drill my ears . Then I did some research also and I found that the folks at Cnet gave this little earbud an editor choice and was rated best bang for your dollars ! Get this if you are looking for earbuds around $ 30 , you won't regret it .  
2	  For those of us who are digitally challenged , this camera is really neat and user friendly . I recommend it to anyone looking for a new digital for recreational use .  
2	  I did a lot of research on this PC , and it 's proving to be everything I thought it would . Fast , quiet , lots of features . Amazon offered a great price , minus the sales tax and shipping , so even " comparision shopping " with local stores , there simply was no comparision , especially when you know what you wanted , and I did .  
1	  It wouldn't read one of my SD cards for no apparent reason . Also , the quality of workmanship is poor . It arrived with factory scratches on both the frame and the screen . Cheap , cheap , cheap ! However , these problems are secondary . The real clencher is the picture quality . If I was to rate the picture quality 1 - 5 stars , I 'd give it 0 stars . It 's very low-res , liney , grainy , and digitized ; the colors are not true ; and it flickers . Looks like something you 'd expect from a cheap children 's toy , NOT a photo frame touted as " the ideal way to showcase all your digital photos . " Your photos would look better printed on notebook paper by an old dot matrix printer . And you 'd save money that way . The only reason I gave it one star is that it does function . You put in a card and ( if you 're lucky ) it will display your photos , do a slide show , etc . But if you 're looking for a quality product , I suggest looking to someone other than Digital Spectrum .  
1	  Believe the bad reviews and poor experiences . I bought a Zune , had absolutely no luck in getting it to work , returned it , bought an iPod . Happiness returned , Zune returned , life is good !  
1	  Purchased this kit just to have the double din piece for a custom install in my Frontier . I was sorely disappointed as the trim piece did not fit flush within the opening . There was a clear 1/8 & # 34 ; gap which looked terrible . I ended up making a custom piece by hand . Do not recommend if using a double din size unit in a Frontier .  
1	  I tried to convert the digital coax optical out from toshiba tv to digital optical in on sound bar . This converter did not work in sending sound from the tv to the sound bar .  
1	  I have purchased the card for my 3 years old Toshiba laptop , which has a wireless card ( b ) so I thought it is time to go faster . I have connected to various access points with it , but for the first week I could not get it to connect to internet , so it would see the networks but it would not connect at all . After installing the latest driver i connected to internet , however even it shows a stronger signal than my laptop 's card it is very very slow . Plus , it did not see some of the networks , which i could see with my laptop 's card . The Tech . guys have been very kind , but their advice did not help . I am very disappointed .  
1	  I bought this Sony HI-MD Walkman as a digital recording device . I wanted to record outdoor events as I biked around France . I installed SonicStage on my Sony Vaio . I charged the battery , hooked up my microphone , and started recording . I pressed the stop and the display says & # 34 ; Writing System File & # 34 ; . Huh ? It stays like that for 10 minutes . I push buttons until it stops . I reconnect to my PC and use SonicStage to reformat the disk . It hangs , never comes back . I kill it and restart it . I download one of the samples to the disk . That works , but _ so_slow _ ! What is that about ? I attempt to delete the files I just put on . SonicStage hangs , the disk spins and never stops . I push buttons until it stops spinning and gives me another cryptic error . Argh . I have had the product for & # 60 ; 24 hours . SonicStage has hung on me 4 times , almost on every operation that I ask of it . The disk has spun endlessly . The error / warning messages are useless . The displays are too small . The product simply does not work well for me !  
2	  This was bought by a friend on my account but when it arrived just a few days after ordering , she made me the most wonderful green salad with every vegetable sliced on top . Wonderful product , easy shipping , and good food made with it .  
2	  received these as a gift after i lost an old pair of cheapy binoculars that i used for birding . was a little wary at first since there were only 2 reviews , but i have to agree with the other reviewers that these are great for people that wear glasses . the plastic twist-up eye cups are much more sturdy and easier to use than the rubber roll-down ones i 've seen on other binoculars . image is crisp and clear , even over glasses . it also seems that the price is also very reasonable , as many birding resources recommend binoculars that cost over $ 100 , if not $ 300 .  
2	  If you 're looking for a way to plug your PS3 ( or other HDMI out video console ) to an HDCP capable DVI monitor look no further . Note however that DVI does not carry audio signals , so you 'll be gaming without sound regardless of if the monitor has speakers or not . If your monitor does not have HDCP capabilities it will not function with a game system that requires it . It 's not a cable issue , it 's a monitor issue . Good quality works @ 1080p without any hickups so 5 * ' s from me , especially for the cheap price :)  
2	  The Tamrac 5749 Velocity 9 Pro Photo Sling Pack is well designed and sturdy . The dividers stay in place as long as they are resting solidly on another object . A second row of Velcro strip would be an improvement . The cut out diagram only indicates how the bag can be packed . The pictures of the actual product clearly show the whole front does not unzip . There is a mesh pocket over a zipped pocket area with dividers for storing and organizing smaller items . The main compartment is accessed from the top only . On the inside of the main compartment 's cover flap is another zippered pocket for items like batteries and CF cards . The bag itself only weighs about 2 lbs that is not a whole lot for a bag . Putting any collection of heavy objects in any bag will make it weigh more . I learned the hard way to pack the equipment I need , and leave what I don't at home / in the hotel . If you choose not to use the waist strap , of course all the weight will rest on one shoulder . The bag was made to include the use of the waist strap with the quick release buckle ! The weight of the bag will not distribute as intended otherwise . I don't think a backpack will make my equipment any lighter . Distribution of weight is on the waist and one shoulder for the sling , and on two shoulders for a similar size backpack . If I only use one shoulder strap of the backpack like many people do , then all the weight would only be on one shoulder . Neither is better than the other in this respect , just different . For travel I found the sling to be handy . I 've been able to swing it around and get what I need out of it fairly easily . This is not always a natural feeling task though and requires some thought in how to pack the bag . I tend to pack the big lenses first and smaller ones on top in the main compartment . While I will change lenses , I have the lens I think I 'm going to use the most already on my Canon 20D ready to shoot and stored in the center like the diagram shows . The pocket inside the main compartment 's cover flap is the most awkward area to access and holds the smaller items I don't need to get at that often . The outside pockets are the easiest areas to access . I have never needed to loosen the shoulder straps to get what I need out of the bag . I 'm tall and slender , so maybe a person 's body type makes a difference in how well the sling function works . The sling is especially beneficial for mass transit situations and crowds . While visiting cities like Rome , or Paris I prefer to use mass transit instead of renting a vehicle or hiring cabs . Crowded buses at rush hour in some European cities or even here in the States are known to be prime pick pocket territory . I can swing the bag around to my front and it is in clear site . I can even sit with it on my front comfortably . PROS : Sling feature handy in mass transit situationsWell designed and sturdyCONS : Could use a second row of Velcro stripNot all areas comfortably accessible while wearing sling bag  
1	  I purchased this camera as a gift for my son a year ago . He has had little occasion to use it . He estimates it 's been used 4 times . Now as he attempts to use it over the holidays , the shutter won't open and the lens won't come forward as the camera is turned on . It is two weeks out of the manufacturer warranty . Of course , neither Amazon or Samsung wish to accept responsibility now that it 's out of warranty . They wish me to pay more to have a camera repaired that 's had very limited use . I certainly don't wish to purchase any more Samsung products and must admit I 'm very disappointed with Amazon 's response , considering how many items I 've purchased through them .  
2	  Just got the Orb USB for my laptop and its great . Immediate 2.2 gigs of space and its removable . For anyone who needs extra drive space for backing up or whatever , this is a great deal . I play my movies off the thing and its just like a hard drive . No skipping or anything . I plan to use it to store all of my MP3 's and video media that I have . So far I havn't had any problems with it . I 'm quite happy with my new Orb . Its a far better deal than Zip drives . Much more storage at a cheaper price . Its a deal and a half .  
2	  Very easy to use . Helpful instructions and simple recipes to get started make it very easy to use for first timers . Always make sure there 's enough liquid and you should be fine .  
2	  While the fidelity is not there for a Polk Audio man such as myself , its just fine for my son 's ( 11 years old ) movies and video games . Surprisingly good bass from a small sub , decent mids and highs from the satellites . Comes will all the mounting hardware . Comes well packed , even though the box was damaged in shipping all the items inside were fine . Recommended .  
1	  It was bulky and if needed to be plugged into a computer .  
2	  I have been an Apple Mac user since 1985 when the first Mac came out . It was a 128K model ( $ 2,795 ) . The difference between that early Mac and the new iMac 2.16GHz , 20 inch model ( $ 1,399 ) is like riding a mule vs . taking the space shuttle to get around . My new iMac 2.16GHz ( plus a new Mac Mini ) have state of the art technology that is beyond stellar . I control my life with these new machines : bill paying , communications ( I am email centric ) , light graphics work , printing and so on is done with Macs . Macs were always good with graphics , but now they are the very best out of the box and I find myself regularly archiving family photos with ease , photos that might never have come out of their shoeboxes without Mac 's new iPhoto . What I need to do probably only uses 5 % of iMac 's capacity to perform . Also , with the Universal capability Macs and PCs are almost joined at the hip so when I get stuff from friends who use PCs I can open almost all their attachments . It was not always this way . Also , I travel a great deal and now can easily stay on top of my life with a speedy Mac on the internet . No more running to post offices all over creation to send off all those routine bill payments . I can't imagine what else I might need in a computer . My needs are not all that complex , I am not a geek or gamer , but the new iMac is worth every penny for normal users too and iMacs covers almost all of the bases ( 99 %) that most people need to cover . And it is just about crash proof so it humms through its chores with ease and with very little frustration for the user . I have never owned a PC , but over the past two decades I have been tempted more than once . I thought about switching to have broader access to everything that makes up the personal computer world . But now I never will switch , there is no need to ! Mac has closed the universality gap and zoomed by PCs and is not looking back ..  
2	  Tthese batteries fixed the issue with my panasonic cordless phones . before purchasing these batteries my headsets would lose connection the main line .  
2	  I have owned the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX Speaker system for eight years . I have moved it from apartments to condos to houses with no failure of cords or connectors . While I agree with other reviewers that the subwoofer crossover is a bit boomy , it can be simply dialed down . This is a fine speaker system . I have enjoyed outstanding performance these many years and I highly recommend them . They are worth every penny ! Now about that ill-conceived power switch .. I purchased a remote power switch - the kind you use with an out of the way lamp or Christmas tree - to power the system on and off . The remote 's fob can sit on your desktop or be adhered to the underside of your desk for a less cluttered desktop . I have employed the same solution to control the power on my external drives , as well . It is a cost effective solution that works flawlessly . Link : DSI EZ Outlet Remote ( 3 Outlets ) Best of luck with your purchase .  
2	  I got this case for my S410 & it is exactly what I wanted , it fits the camera like a glove . It would 've been nice if there was a small pocket for the memory stick , but with memory cards available upto 1GB who would want to carry extra memory anyway ! .  
1	  This product is great , I already have one of this in my house . This is probably the best one on the market , that 's why I purchased another one for the second TV . Unfortunately , I was sent a smaller model ( with 2 wall mounts ) instead of the ordered one ( with 3 wall mounts ) . I 'm sure it was NOT just an honest mistake - the box had a picture of the item inside and clearly indicated a different model . The condition of the item was not good at all : the box was dirty and dusty , it was definitely opened and taped back more than once . However , the parts inside did not looked like they were used , so I 'd guess it could be counted as a new item . I contacted COD Texas ( the supplier ) with the information about the wrong item ; they did NOT offer a replacement and asked to return the item back . However , I decided to keep the item with one less wall mount because I needed to complete the remodeling right away and based on the manual would 've worked fine for the TV I have ( latest TV models weigh significantly less than older models ) . I gave 2-star rating to COD Texas not the product . I 've made a lot of purchases through Amazon , that was the first time I received product in this condition and had such a low-level customer service .  
2	  I can just say that soundspeakers are excelent . You can hear a high , medium and low frequences and clear voice . Moreover , speakers are small . I highly recommend this product .  
1	  Received the unit yesterday . Plug it in this morning with the exitement .. The unit played exactly one single MP3 song then hung up . Powered cycle did not help . I unluged and put it back . Now it does not have display on its pannel . My CD is still stuck in there . .. I think you only get luck for certain unit , depending on the mood of their expertise employees when they build . Take your chance if you want to pay for the .. price and possibly get hassle .  
1	  I bought this router a few months ok wanting to upgrade from the basic Linksys wireless router . I thought I would be able to get N mode working but found out that no game consoles use it and you need the N adapter which costs just as much as the router so I couldn't use that mode for any of my computers . After connecting it , and optimizing it to the best performance I could get working which was just the next one under Extreme N mode , I got the same results as the Linksys router . No difference what so ever . So I resorted to just going wired . To make your computer N compatible , it will cost you close to $ 200 for the adapter and this router . So unless you want to spend the money for it , go for it , it will be better but its only limited to whats N mode ready . If you 're not gonna use N mode , then skip this and just go with the Linksys wirless basic router . You 'll get the same performance . This router is not worth the money if you 're not already N compatible .  
1	  This alarm clock is very large . It took up a quarter of my nightstand ! And the sound quality was nothing to brag about . I returned it . Not impressed .  
2	  I 've been using the same trackball mouse for over 6 years now and when that crapped out on me i decided it was time for a change . I loved my old mouse but the Kensington is just fantastic . I was incredibly skeptical at first . The way the ball was grinding in the socket for the first half hour seemed like cheap design . But after playing my games with it for a couple of hours the socket wore in and the ball moves so smoothly its insane . The button design i was also skeptical i 'd get used to but after only a few minutes my hands adjusted straight to a perfect position to play with the mouse . If it 's your first or your 100th trackball mouse you need to give your hand time to adjust , the way these things are used is very counterintuitive for most people . As with any new hardware you can learn to use it to its fullest potential if you take the time to learn . Absolutely - MUST BUY  
2	  This RCA antenna does the job . It 's small bit has bunny ears . Channels come in well enough . Easy to install .  
2	  Like most of us , I spent a significant amount of time researching MP3 players . I finally decided on a Creative Zen Vision : M 30 GB MP3 and video player . What a buy ! I got a great price from Amazon and it works great . The average rating for this product was four out of five stars . I gave it five stars because it rocks !  
1	  This player basically does nothing but make its owner jump thru hoops . Can you say work around ? That 's what you 're in for . Can't play most formats . I haven't found a video format yet that it will play . Try creating a playlist and you might end up throwing it thru a window . Why doesn't this company create some software to run this player like everyone else does ? The interface is made for a baby 's fingers ( e.g. , the not so joyful STICK ) .. AND .. the remote will give you Carpal Tunnel from repeated pressing over and over with no results . ZEN 's and IPODS are a pleasure to use after this thing .. WOLFIE is way over priced for what you get .. CONS : Everything about it . No redeeming qualities .. Pros : Still looking .. but I 've pretty much given up . BUY THIS IF YOU want to be frustrated .. I would give this a zero star rating if I could .  
2	  I am not an audiophile , but these fit my small ears and didn't fall out . They were a great value for the money . I paid about 15 bucks for them on eBay not realizing I could have spent a bit more to secure the two-year warranty by buying on Amazon . The left bud just conked out one day . But overall , these were great .  
2	  I liked this product a lot and use it 2-3 times per week to watch movies , football , etc . The additional adapters seem to be useful though I have not used those yet . Overall , I am very satisfied with the quality of the cord .  
1	  Tons of static and I have a direct line running from this into my car stereo ( NOT FM TUNER ) . It charges fine and cuts off ipod when I turn off engine but the amount of static makes it unusable . I would have been better off with just a cheap charger for the car .  
1	  Very disappointed with this item ! It never charged the Zune , and then in a matter of minutes , the cable became unattached from the charger ! I would certainly NOT recommend this item to anyone . If I could give it less stars I would .  
1	  The speaker size is only 6 1/3 inches . I have a set of 10 inch PMS speakers and the base speakers , them-selves , are 10 inches . The overall diameter is is 12 inches . These speakers are listed as 12 inches ; that includes their out most diameter , not the size of the speaker . This size is an over rated , less than what is listed .  
2	  The cable was exactly what I needed to get a better viewing experience from my internet TV provider ( Hulu ) . The cable is a simple plug in at each end and also has the recommended ferrite core . I noticed no noise or distortion in the picture and sound . It was also much less than cables available locally .  
2	  I am a very serious amateur photographer and I bought this camera on January 1 , 2008 . I bought this as a bundle with the 18-55mm lens and the 55-200mm lens . I used this camera for nearly two years and it traveled with me all over the United States , everywhere from oceans to forests to Long 's Peak , Colorado to the deserts of the south west . Its a basic and easy to use camera aimed towards beginners in the dSLR world . It takes crystal clear shots in daylight and even inside with ample light . In darker situations the camera is sub par to others I have used . It tends to be very grainy with occasional random colored light dots . The construction quality is alright but not weather resistant . I suppose no camera I have can compare to my Canon EOS 1N 35mm camera that was weather resistant and at its time was Canon 's flagship model . The D40x is alright in my book .  
2	  Have had it for months and have ordered 2 more . Does as It should .  
1	  This mouse is junk . It has oil in side pockets and this goes all over your hands . These microsoft folks are crooks - would you agree ?  
2	  I use this to connect my iPod and laptop to my stereo by my couch . I 've been through a few of the cheap $ 2 cables and while they work fine , they eventually break from everyday use and I needed something a little beefier . This cable works great , the quality is great , the connectors are metal and feel a lot more solid than the plastic ones . the cable itself is a little thicker and feels like it has more insulation on it . No hum or buzzing on the sound . I can't comment on whether it 's perfect because I 'm running the sound into a 15 year old Sony hi-fi combo stereo ( the RCA input is labelled minidisc ) but it sounds just as good as CDs I play on it . Well worth the $ 10 . I just wish it was a little longer , but that 's my fault for not measuring  
2	  I had no problem finding information about this item , the price was excellent , it came quickly and works excellently  
1	  I was so looking forward to having a new coffee maker that would not be letting the grounds touch plastic .. but the water might be reaching too hot of temperature , I don't know , because after 5 days of trying and after buying the most expensive and delicious percolator grind coffee I could find , it still doesn't taste right .. so I 'm returning it .. Also , it is a little more cumbersome to clean it , refill it with grinds and water , etc .. the whole routine takes more time than your normal coffeemaker ..  
1	  The following is is a letter sent to Netgear regarding their policy of refusing technical support unless private , personally identifiable information is provided . To whom this should concern , As I look around my server room and count numerous Netgear products , I 'm sad to say that as much as I feel your products are good quality , these will positively be my last purchases from your company . Your policy of extorting personal information from your customers by refusing support unless personal information is provided is absolutely reprehensible . Releasing private information such as address , phone , and email , etc . should always remain a personal choice ! If , as a corporation you feel that filling your mailing list is more important than serving your paying customers , then I will under no circumstances continue to serve you with my dollars . Let me understand this train of thought . I purchase devices from your company to secure my privacy , yet you feel I should relinquish my privacy as a requirement to receive support on a product I 've paid for . Not in this lifetime ! How arrogant ? Someone over there must be prepping for a career in politics . Every company touts the same story , " We Don't Sell Your Personal Information " . You know as well as I , that many do exactly that . Registration information is a huge market . Our information is sold in direct conflict with Privacy Statements every day . After all , who 's to know ? Certainly not the consumer ! We , of course are left to pay the price with annoying spam and junk mail or worse . Since as a consumer I have no control over this information once it has been transmitted , the only safe course of action for me is no action . KEEP IT PRIVATE ! This is a rule to which I strictly adhere and I 'm pleased to say that after 20 years in the computer industry my tech related junk mail is ZERO . I 've performed my part and paid for your product . What gives Netgear the right to my personal information ? Are you that out of touch with privacy issues today ? So Here it is . You value my name , address , phone number and first born male child . Like many others , I value my privacy enough to include it in my daily purchasing decisons as should all of us . I hold posession of my finances and as a consequence your router has gone back to the retailer and has been exchanged for a Linksys of similar features and price . I 'm happy to say that my support questions to them were answered without incident and I 'm more than pleased with that purchase and the service which followed . Finally , let me be up front . This letter will be posted to every relevent usenet tech forum , not as a flame but as a pre-sale public service notice . If you don't wish to give up your privacy , DON'T PURCHASE NETGEAR . Those who feel as I do may be spared the lost hours of a second trip to the store for refund or exchange . If only a small percentage of the thousands of people who will read this document walk up to a person in a store holding a netgear box and relay these concerns , maybe you 'll get the message . You spent good money in marketing to bring us to your products . It 's a shame to waste it with policies that serve little purpose but to alienate us as consumers . SincerelyRichard S FayFormer Netgear Customer  
1	  My Toshiba 42 " 1080 lasted 7 months prior to losing its picture . It was taken to the warenty repair station and part ordered and back ordered the same day taken in . Today is one month into the repair , no TV and still no part . No excuse for this kind of service on a $ 2000 product in this day and age . Parts can be gotton anywhere in the world in three days or less , from my experience . The Repair station called today to get me to come pick the TV up to get it out of his way cause its cluttering his work area up . Totally Disgusted with this kind of service , and just want to warn folks against buying a Toshiba product , cause this is what your getting for repair support . Jamie  
2	  Super camera . Great picture and sound for such a little camera . Posted first video on Youtube .  
1	  I 've had this camera for a couple of years now and though it has never taken very good photos , it was good enough for the snapshots I take ( not much of a photographer ) though quite pricey at the time I bought it . I have never used it much but in the last year it intermittently refuses to turn on . It doesn't matter if I have fresh batteries in it or not . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't . If I take the batteries out and put them back in that will sometimes get it to work . Regardless , Kodak knows about the problem as I am not alone with this issue but they are doing nothing about it . Frankly , I think Kodak has terrible low end and mid range products ( I also have a Kodak AIO that I spent a fortune on that is hardly used and needs new printheads ) and their customer service reps are in denial . I 'm not sure why they call it " support . " Once upon a time when I was young Kodak had one of the best reps around but not anymore . I will never buy their products again . I suggest that you get a better camera from Sony or Cannon . They 're better quality for your money .  
2	  This set is the best that I had since my Samson studio monitors . I really was surprised how good they sounded . Their price is fairly cheap for what you get in return . Amazing set ! I warmly recommend ..  
1	  I ordered this item and received a Andrew P7390-S.Andrew 's customer support said that this model only works with800mhz-band phones ; it does * NOT * work with PCS ( 1900mhz ) phones .  
1	  I had to buy this one so that I could replace the plug in sensor from my first purchase that I had only had a month as the cost to only replace the sensor was almost as much as a new mouse . The plug in for this wireless mouse is huge . It is over 2 inches long , and is easy to knock into things and if you accidentially drop your lap top or it falls , it will break , as did mine . The mouse functions great . I was unaware of the other similar mice that had much smaller USB plug ins , or I would not have bought this one to replace the broken Microsoft one . I would highly recommend you look at others instead of this one with the smaller plug ins that are less likely to break or bend . The plug in with this one is an accident waiting to happen . I have no idea why Microsoft made it so big . It is almost as long as the mouse . Stupid idea . But the mouse works great . Sad .  
2	  I purchased this router to round out my new wireless home network . The router is excellent , easy to maintain and the security works very well . I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the setup software . The instructions say to use the CD that comes with it , but it would not setup the router correctly . I went to the Linksys website and used their Windows XP tool and in about 2 minutes I had a wireless network ! Very pleased , and as usual , Linksys makes outstanding products .  
2	  The card came carefully packed and in perfect condition . It also arrived prior to the date they promised .  
1	  I don't know how many times I had to turn this machine off and on just to clear it . Would constantly get " hung up " when using ANY of the functions : faxing , receiving , scanning , printing , copying . Ink ran out without warning and WAY before it should have . Spend so much time re-doing everything .  
2	  My 17 " laptop used to overheat no matter what I did . I tried different methods of cooling with minimal success . My laptop hasn't overheated once since I started using the NZXT . It 's quite sturdy and good sized which is another plus for me , but some may not like this if they are looking for a cushier cooler . I use it at the table so it 's fine . All in all I 'm very happy with my purchase .  
2	  I spent A LOT of time trying to find a reasonably priced tripod that had true fluid-head smooth panning and tilting . I have my own videography business , and had spent $ 100 on a tripod that was jerky when you tried to pan or tilt . This velbon cost $ 60 and is incredibly smooth for pan and tilt . The tripod is a little bit too light weight . i wish it was a bit sturdier . but other than that , excellent tripod for the price . To get a significantly better tripod , you 'd have to pay at least $ 180 . update : 8.1.07after having used this tripod for close to a year , it no longer performs well . the camera sits crooked on the head now and the tripod is useless .  
2	  Bought this for my jetset brother as I love my own pair . Great sound for the price . I have not listened to the Bose but the price difference is large . Well built phones that comfortable to wear for long flights . Has an audible hiss / hum in very quiet environments but this is not a problem at all in its " natural habitat " of planes , trains etc . Great buy overall .  
1	  I 've had this ViewSonic model for a little over a year . It has been good to be until now . I have been losing pixels every week for the past month . I 'm out 25-30 pixels . Aren't products suppose to last longer then this ?  
2	  My mom had been without television for quite a while due to a switch to digital broadcasting . I bought her a newer digital-ready LCD television and this antenna for x-mas . Due to icy conditions on her steeply-pitched roof , I elected to install the antenna in the attic of her older wood-framed house . I attached the DB2 to a stick , leaned it against an upright 2 x 4 , ran a 75 ' length of coax cable through the wall downstairs , hooked it up and had the television scan for channels . As I had not oriented the antenna and had read the disclaimer warning about signal loss for interior vs exterior installation , I wasn't expecting much . The television found every channel in the area , including two my mother had never seen before . There was no sign of signal loss whatsoever . I just went back up the ladder into the attic , nailed the antenna in place and called it a day . My mom , who is on a fixed income , was very happy and decided she didn't need a cable television subscription after all .  
1	  This printer has been an absolute nightmare . We wanted an all in one so we wouldn't have so many machines in our office . Well when you try to print something it stops halfway and you can't get it to finish printing without shutting down your pc and the printer and rebooting everything . This might work if you 're lucky . We 've called HP several times to no avail . They seem to have no idea what the problem is because they 've had us try all sorts of nonsence that doesn't work . They were absolutely no help . I could get a realiable printer for the fraction of the cost and that 's what I intend to do . We 've stuck with this printer for so long because of the cost , but I just can't take it anymore .  
2	  I was very pleased with the product and the service - I hope they are able to keep this business model . I will certainly check-out AMAMAX when I need similar products .  
1	  I have to say , the discs are great . Never a problem and quick to copy . That being said , it appears that no matter which brand of balnk DVD or CD I purchase from Amazon , they are ALWAYS poorly packed resulting in destroyed " hatbox containers " and sometimes discs even loose in the box . I have written to customer service , but if this continues ( as it has for about the last year ) I 'm going to give up a few bucks savings here and turn to local retailers . I 'm sure some of the blame can be laid at UPS 's doorstep , but if theye were packed right , I don't believe the problem would be so overarching .  
1	  Not CD quality . Not even standard FM radio quality . Fuzzy , weak signal , and volume dips when bass kicks in . Do not recommend .  
2	  Best Buy wanted over $ 20 for a basic printer cable while Amazon offers this Belkin for a quarter of the price . This is a high quality , well made cable that works flawlessly . I 've always found Belkin to be a good but inexpensive brand . If you need a parallel cable , I 'd strongly recommending buying this .  
1	  I 'm so sorry to see Canon go down this road . The printer exists to sell inkjet cartridges . You can't use your own or refill them ( they have a security sensor so that you have buy new ones ) . Worst of all , if either of the inkjet cartridges is low ( they 'll run out whether you use them or not , just because they are opened ) THE REST OF THE UNIT SHUTS DOWN . That 's right - you are not allowed to use the scanner if the inkjet cartridges are low ! ( No , scanners don't need ink . ) There 's lots online about the way certain printer companies have designed their units to force purchasing of expensive ink cartridges . I didn't think Canon was among them , but apparently they are .  
2	  That was the first thing out of my mouth when I placed these on my head ! I just got a pair of AKG K702 's for my self , and after 100 hours of break in , I was very disappointed . Now , I understand that I need an amp for the AKG 's and so I will wait for that before passing final judgment on them . I got this pair of Grado 's for my little brother 's birthday . He is an art student who spends the majority of his day painting , drawing and listening to music . I decided to break them in for him before I gave them to him . I plugged them into my Stereo while playing Paul McCartney 's 1985 45 rpm record . I just saw him life in Detroit earlier this year , and I have never heard anything like what I heard when I listened to these headphones . I can't describe it , it was unbelievable beautiful , and they only had 30 seconds of break in time ! Later that night , I plugged them into my Sony Vaio laptop , and put on some James Blake . The only way I can describe it is that it sounded like Mr. Blake was whispering beautiful sounds into my ears for only me to enjoy . I have always loved music , I have always appreciated amazing sound , i was with my father when he spent 10k on his system back in 1990 . There is nothing I have ever heard that is like what I experienced with these headphones . By Brother 's reaction when I gave them to him was the same as mine . He will be completely rediscovering his entire music collection . I will own a pair of these or SR325is 's soon .. I really didn't want to give these to my brother after hearing them .. but I 'm glad he did , I didn't want to experience , this alone . Don't even hesitate , BUY THESE HEADPHONES !  
2	  Hmm , the 1 stars puzzle me . I have a Dell , 2.66 , 512 RAM , Dell video and sound , XP Home with SP2 ( which you should get , great popup blocker ) . I just purchased the Dazzle 90 . Hooked it up , click on the new hardware bubble , pop in the CD , follow the instructions , and you 're ready to go . Launched Movie Maker 2 , used it to video capture , converted VCR and Hi-8 analog camcorder footage to high quality WMV , 640x480 resolution . Used RCA cables . Haven't tried S-video cable yet for my Sony camcorder . But noticed Movie Makers copy to CD did not mean a VCD . So I decided to install their Quick Start Movie Studio 9 . Well , very much like Movie Maker , not as intuitive or simple , but with more features however . Used it to create a VCD . I was able to see the video capture in the preview window when playing the VCD . So , I 'd assume it can capture DVD 's as well . This loses one star because , what the heck is in this contraption to make it cost $ 90 ! ? It 's lighter than a roll of toiler paper . And no cables . Man , at least give me an RCA cable so I don't have to pull it off the VCR that 's connected to the TV . I can set up a wirless internet system for $ 90 . I can purchase a sleek mini-shelf stereo system . I can purchase a 19 " color TV for crying out loud . All I get is plastic triangle with holes , the size of a small pie at Denny 's . $ 90 , that 's a bus trip to Las Vegas . What 's in this thing to make it cost so much ? Well , in the first nights practice , it was easy to setup , converted small samples of VHS and Hi-8 tape to WMV and VCD . The software was easy enough and can make a VCD so I 'll use it instead . It sure beats the Adaptec version I first purchased . What a nightmare that was . I think it 's a good device . It wasn't that hard . I don't know what kind of computers those 1 star guys have , it 's it was simple . Just why the heck does this thing need to cost $ 90 ? If this thing were $ 50 or less , I 'd be ecstatic and give it the full 5 stars .  
1	  I agree with another comment that the button on the side of the handle is to easy to accidentally press and change the mode unknowingly . When using with the Canon PowerShot S3 IS , I found it doesn't work with the manual settings I prefer . You have to still use the pop-up flash to trigger the slave . Maybe a diffuser to eliminate the effects of the pop-up will impove the results . While it does what it said it would do , in order to do what I want to do , I need to upgrade my whole system . If I want to be professional , I need a professional system . This is okay for now while I 'm getting my studio business back up and running .  
2	  Love this mouse . extremely accurate , well designed and in my opinion it 's the best in its class by a long shot . Although the batteries need to be swapped once a day , its a small 10 second ( max ) inconvenience when you consider the 2 other options ( software even alerts you before the battery goes dead ) . Those 2 other options are to either buy a corded mouse which gets annoying and limits future mobile options OR get a mouse that needs to be in a charging stand every night at the risk of forgetting and having NO use of it for hours . If and WHEN that happens you 'll WISH you spent a few extra $ ' s and got the G7 laser . Also with a permanent chargeable battery , once it no longer holds a charge you 'll have to buy a new mouse instead of just getting new battery packs . Having swappable batteries trades off all those long term negative issues for one minor and mindless 5-10 second swap out .. to me buying this mouse is a no brainer . ( only gave it a 4 stars because it doesnt have a " forward " button only a " back " button ) PS : I have had this mouse for just about a year now . PSS : It has quite a long range as well  
1	  I had a five dollar set of bunny ears attached to my HDTV here in Chicago . Reception was great for all Chicago HD channels except for Fox in HD . I saw this antenna at Best Buy and it said on the box that it was optimized for HD reception . I thought the Fox HD reception would improve when I replaced my cheapo bunny ears with this RCA ANT401 . Unfortunately , I could not get clear reception from any HD channels after installing it .  
1	  Had great luck with this second unit for almost 3 months . Then on day 87 of my 90 day return period the recorder would only work for 5 or 10 minutes of recording , then shut off ! I was archiving tapes I had done previously , and there was no reason for this . Apparently Cyberhome self destructs just about the time their warranty is up ! Fortunately the store where I purchased it , which is known for low quality imported merchandise , took it back for a full refund . They no longer sell this item in the stores , only online . Makes you wonder how many thousands they had returned ..  
2	  I opted for the compatible xerox toner instead of the original HP toner for my HP laserjet 4M + . Shipping was superfast . I had the toner in two days with free UPS shipping . The xerox toner worked great in my hp laserprinter . No problems at all . I am very happy that I saved 80 dollars . What a great deal !  
1	  This is really cool scanner , it 's everything the reviews say about it . Unfortunately I use scanners to scan really small objects . This scanner has a small depth of focus . At 1200 DPI it 's focus was even out on a slightly wrinkled twenty dollar bill . The scanner just does not focus on objects . On my old HP Scanjet 4P , and my new HP ScanJet 5300C objects are in perfect focus . Also at 1200 DPI , the picture was a little misaligned . If you can spare the desk space , the HP ScanJet 5300C is a much better scanner .  
1	  I got these batteries 3 days ago . Put them on the charger and today put 2 of them in my Kodak PowerShot A590IS . I took 33 pictures . Then I went shopping and left the camera home . While I was cooking dinner I thought I would review the pictures . Turned the camera on and it flashed the change battery light at me . So I changed over to the two others , and immediately the screen told me to change batteries . Those were dead too . Tomorrow they are going back to the store . They are JUNK batteries .  
1	  I am so disappointed with the product that I am trying hard to get rid of this 3-in-1 combo . It does none of these 3 jobs in any credible manner . Well photos are kind of polarized ( multi colored ) . Dont know why but the picture quality has degraded to absymal levels ( i mean in 6 months ) . I bought this product for around 350 US $ ( in India ) and now terribly regret the decision . It plays mp3s well but it makes no sense to carry a cam to listen to music . No comments on movie cam . totally flawed product !  
2	  I got my first ipod when the 3rd gen Nano came out and proceeded to fill it up right away . Now what ? This 80GB was the perfect answer . I do not know how people can say 1-3 ratings . Mine is wonderful . I have 4,500 songs on it every CD I own . now I am converting my Records to CD and putting them on it too , I have 200 + albums and it will still not come close to filling this baby . I got the square ipod home Amazon had as a deal of the day . It sounds fantastic .. just like Bose . I crank that baby up and hear it all thru the house . I love that I can have all my CD 's in one tiny place and take it with me . I highly recommed this ipod . It is bult sturdy too . My only sligt complaint is that many of my albums do not have artwork available in the itune store . I guess my type music is the most popluar . Christian Contempory .  
2	  After receiving an email titled " Best MP3 Player you never heard of " I reasearched the Archos 605 MP3 Player . It was hard to find anything negitive about the 605 . I purchased the Archos 605 about 1 month ago and now can confirm that it trully is the best MP3 Player on the market . There is nothing that cant be done with the 605 , from Wi-Fi internet browsing to music to the best quality video of any player today .  
2	  This was so close to being great , but it just has a few snags . Pros : - It works , and appears to be very accurate-It has been durable so far-The probes are long enoughCons : - You have to take the back off of the unit to turn it on , this is kind of a hassle . - The little hook that you hang it on is not very robust . - The remote range is pitiful . I can't leave it inside my house with the smoker 15 feet away . I have to put it outside the window and look out . That last one is kind of a sticking point for many , I imagine . If your smoker is right outside your door , you may be fine . But don't plan on grabbing a beer and sitting on the couch with the sensor , because not only will it not work , but it won't tell you it 's not working . It will just show you the last reading . So you think your meat is at a steady 225 but your coals went out an hour ago . So do I still recommend it ? Yes . But don't think that you won't still have to check your meat on a regular basis to make sure everything is still going fine .  
1	  This company does not live up to their promises when supporting their products . Once they sell you a product , you are essentially on your own if if breaks or does not work as advertised . I do not recommend purchasing ANY of their products . They will leave you high and dry !  
1	  I had basically the same set with my earlier model Canon ( same company and same specs ) and I have to say , I was disappoined with the quality and design . Problems : 1 . The lenses blocked the flash and the viewfinder . 2 . The telephoto lens had barrelling ( much more than I anticipated ) . 3 . The system is bulky . 4 . Again , when you want to use the wide-angle lens ( usually indoors ) , it blocks the flash and so you end up with a bad picture . 5 . After you find out you are disappointed with the set , you probably won't be able to get back more than 50 % of what you paid for it . 6 . The cameras this lens set is supposed to go with are not designed with lenses in mind ( even though they made it so you can add them ) . Basically , the set is ONLY for any type of decent use outside . The pictures I got with it outside were decent ( hence 2 stars , not 1 star ) , but .. If you are really set on getting more zoom , GET A BETTER CAMERA . There are several cameras that are out in the market now with 10x & 12x zoom ( plus a stabalizer built into the camera ) . Also , ( cost of your camera + cost of this set ) > ( cost of a new / better camera with higher zoom ) . There are also cameras with a wide-angle zoom lens designed into the camera . So , why not just go with the better quality lens ( es ) in the camera in a more compact design ? Below are some cameras that are looking pretty good with higher zooms than the standard 3x or 4x zoom and are also at good prices on Amazon : Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ4 ( most expensive of the four ) _ 4MP Digital Camera with 12x Image Stabilized Optical ZoomPanasonic Lumix DMC-LZ2 ( great price , but note that there is no viewfinder ) _ 5MP Digital Camera with 6x Image Stabilized Optical ZoomSamsung Digimax A55W_5MP Digital Camera with 4.8x Wide Angle ZoomOlympus Camedia C755 ( not sure if there is a viewfinder ) _ 4MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical ZoomThese are the best priced cameras with higher zooms that I have found on Amazon . There are also many many more cameras that have more megapixels ( up to 8 MP ) and zoom ( up to 12x ) , but prices also get higher with those cameras .  
2	  This was only the second DVD player I have had , and the first with Blu-Ray . The menuing system is very nice and easy to use . Setup is very straight forward . I used the USB interface to update the firmware . Produces very good video images , and fantastic sound . I have only one complaint about the way the product is sold on Amazon and perhaps if I had read several reviews I would have discovered this . The user guide makes it clear that for the best results the DVD should be connected to your TV with an HDMI cable . However this Samsung model does NOT come with an HDMI cable , but only the component cables . Therefore if you buy this player also buy an HDMI cable .  
2	  Please trust me when I tell you that these speakers are great . The sound from Sony 's SSF-7000 speakers gives my living room a much needed PUNCH ! For under $ 200.00 this is a deal that shouldn't be ignored . I 've built my entertainment center around my Sony PS3 with all Sony products , because I thought it was time to have everything sync together as one unit . The only probblem I had was that one of the speaker cover was damaged at the top , but the speaker was untouched . The covers should be well protected since they'er so flimsy . Still a great purchase . If Sony sends me a replacement cover , i 'll be a Amazon shopper for life . Update January 2013 : I can't believe these speakers sound the way they do . When I slap in a blu-ray disk , these speakers kick like 2 angry mules ! If you live in an apartment like I do , your neighbors are going to love you , ( not ) . I have the new Sony 7.2 a / v reciever but only using the 5.1 setup but will order 2 more Sony speakers in the near future . Music sounds good from these speakers , but the real deal is watching movies with these tower speakers ! Its really like having your own movie theatre . The speakers are tall , slim and looks great enough to be displayed without being overwhelming . I like the fact that they don't need to be cranked up to the max to be heard , even at a low volume they sound impressive . Make sure you have a good reciever to push these bad boys and you'ii come to love these speakers like I do . Check out my other reviews on the Sony items i 've purchased from Amazon , Thank you .  
1	  When playing standard audio CDs , there is an audible gap between tracks ! So if you are listening to Dark Side of the Moon , Sgt . Pepper , Kid A , or virtually any live album , you 'll be subjected to a dropout during what should be a smooth transition between tracks ! Really irritating to say the least . I 've never heard of a player having this problem , and as far as I 'm concerned it is unacceptable and inexcusable . I thought maybe I had a defective unit , but upon contacting the manufacturer , I 've been told that it is normal for the sp90 , and nothing can be done about it . I returned mine immediately for a refund . I don't know if the other rio players have this flaw . And by the way , the 120 seconds of skip protection applies only to mp3s-standard audio cds have a maximum of 40 seconds . Buyer beware !  
2	  it works as a splitter is supposed to , can't complain , if you need a splitter , then what else can you ask for ?  
2	  Fabulous digital music player ! I use Linux ( Ubuntu ) and this connects perfectly-it mounts as an external USB storage device . It also plays more than just the standard mp3 , wav and wma formats , but also supports free formats like ogg and flac . If you use Linux and want a 20 GB HDD digital music player I recommend this one highly !  
1	  Big blotches on all printed pages .. Not usable for even the lowest printing needs . Nothing more to say about this product  
1	  this product arrived deadamazon would not accept a return or refundthis policy is unacceptabledo not buy from this site  
1	  Quite possibly one of the worst wireless routers every produced . It lacks features that routers much older than it possess such as the ability to reserve addresses for DHCP ( just hope you get lucky , I guess ) and many others . Secondly , it is a terrible router for any computers running Windows XP or Windows Vista . Not only does it not have any ability whatsoever to reconnect commputers from standby or hibernate ( a common problem in wireless networking ) , it can't even keep computers that are running 100 % of the time connected . Apparently , its DHCP implementation does not match up with all of the other wireless routers out there . Apparently just to ensure that not only is the Trendnet wireless router upon arrival , but that it will continue to be for all time to come , the firmware " upgrade " on the Trendnet website has a newer version number on the website , but installing it on the wireless router does not update either the version number or the date . There is a reason you can get good deals on these all of the time . Anyone who spends any time in networking knows they are junk and so , the only way they can hope to sell them is by dumping them at bargain prices with rebates to unsuspecting users who aren't aware that this wireless router is useless for pretty much any network .  
2	  I recently forgot my ipod charger while traveling and went to a big box store to look for one . I was shocked at how expensive they were . I had one of these kits at home , so I ordered a second for travel - at this price I can just keep it in my bag . Easy to use and works great - can't ask for more .  
1	  I bought this printer less than a month ago and its already not working right . The paper keeps jamming . The paper tray is jammed and won't come out of the printer . I tried using the other paper feed and I get the same response that the paper is jammed . I wish I had paid attention to the amazon reviewer who mentioned the paper jam problem . This is my first and last time buying Brother .  
2	  My first Canon-very impressed . I use the MP600 with an iMac and Tiger OSX 10.4.11 . The software really works well , much better than the HP I replaced . Scanning to docs and email works great . It prints from both the tray and the open sheet feeder ( great for printing Quicken checks and envelopes ) . A simple button changes the feed from tray to sheet feeder . Fast and excellent quality print . Haven't used it for photos since we do those online . Ink seems to last pretty well-haven't replace them yet and it 's been 6 months or so .  
1	  The way carrier was described appeared just right for my needs . When item arrived , the only person it would fit in my family was my 7 year old son , who had no idea what it was and didn't want anything to do with it . Misleading advertisements do no one any good especially merchants pushing things like this .  
2	  Excellent price and worked as expected with the Sony digital camera my mom was using until the camera got replaced with a Canon due to some water damage from a cruise .  
2	  I love this Mp3 player ! Don't think you have to buy the new Creative Zen V or even the 8gb MicroPhoto . If you don't need 8 gb , settle for 4 . It hold 2,000 songs anyway . You can't go wrong with this price either . You can only get a screenless-1 gb for this price on an Ipod . Don't worry about it coming out a year ago either . It is just as high tech as any other mp3 . This one works so well . It is really easy to access all of my songs and they can be organized in so many ways to my liking . The screen is beautiful and the pictures come up extra clear . You can put plenty of songs on it , and it 's small and easy to use . The glowing blue light is desirable . The battery and charging cord all work fine to me . I would advise getting a different charging cord , so you don't have to connect it to your computer all the time . The headphones work great , and it was really easy to get this to work on my computer . It works with almost all song programs and even has one of it 's own . Files transfer onto it in a breeze . Some other features that may not have been mentioned on this page are it 's FM radio , sound recording , organizer , contacts , schedule , date / time , and etc . It is a little bit of everything rolled into one . I have very few complaints . The only thing that bugs me is the touchpad . It is a little sensitive and sometimes gets bumped a little , but you get used to using it after awhile . It is also pretty sturdy , so you don't have to worry about it falling apart . Just to help any new customers , when you first get this player , charge the battery fully first . Also , the USB cable takes a little force to get it into the player for the first time . Buy this Mp3 , I guarentee you will be satisfied .  
1	  Chief website says " Chief products are designed and manufactured at the corporate headquarters , located in Savage , Minnesota . " I went with Chief because of this statement . I got it today and box clearly says " made in China " I try to buy made in USA things whenever possible and am very disappointed that this isn't . I feel deceived . I 'm returning to find one that is made in America . I got an offer from beamupusa to drill holes to fit my projector and their products say they are so I 'll probably go that route . It would be nice if Amazon put in country of origin for every product . It should say where assembled and where manufactured .  
2	  This product is a must have if you want to add more lenses to the camera . Since I MUST have all Canon products for my camera , ( powershot IS5 ) there was no other option than to have this adapter .  
1	  I need one the I can connect to my old computer printer port that need the male to connect to my female port . this one wasn't the right type .. I have to have one with the male prones  
2	  Great cable ( 5 meters / 16.4 feet ) that is totally pro quality . This USB 2.0 A male to B male is connected to my HP Photosmart C7180 and my Toshiba Satellite laptop . Looks great and works perfectly !  
2	  Ordered this for my husband as a gift after online research . So far it works great , it took him a couple hours to set it up with HDTV , DVD , TIVO etc . Everything worked great and also easier to fix when different setting on the receiver etc get " out of sync " .  
2	  I didn't have a lot of cash to spend on speakers , so you better bet that I did my research before purchasing these . And man , did I make a good decision . The bass is AMAZING , and I don't even have an amp wired in , just running off my JVC head unit . I have not yet installed the tweeters , so I 'm excited that there is still more to come . For under $ 50 , you just can't beat it .  
1	  The same thing just happened to me-I plugged it in , it worked great , I turned off the car and unplugged everything to go into a store , I came back and plugged it back and the ipod won't turn on . I didn't notice any sparks , but the ipod reset instructions are not doing anything . perhaps this is a bad batch ? has it happened to anyone else ?  
1	  I bought this item pleased that I would now be able to eliminate two remotes from my current setup-AND I wouldn't have coding problems with the remote as my TV is a 32 " Samsung LCD . That part all worked fine . But the VHS player was SO noisy-I had it set to record at a certain time , and when it came on ( as I was reading ) it was so annoying I had to turn it off . The second unit I got on exchange was exactly the same . It is the motor that drives the tape that makes the noise-as I played a prerecorded tape with the same problem . The other main drawback is all controls are on the DVD side , even the recording of the VHS and the elimination of channels for the VHS tuner . This is very awkward . Logic does not tell one to go to the DVD side to set up VHS items . On the plus side , the tape tracking automatically sets itself so all tapes play well , and the HD output for the DVD ( won't work for VHS ) is good . Can't get past the motor noise-it 's going back .  
1	  bought a pair of these speakers to use in my backyard , one of the woofers stopped working , so the seller sent me a replacement . The replacement 's woofer was lose and the low end sounded awful . Got another replacement . A couple days after receiving the replacement , both speakers broke using a 75 watt receiver turned up less than half way  
1	  I expected more from it .. Sound is terrible and so plastic ! not possible to enjoy music with this speakers . No sound / effects / volume adjustments helped , it is still making dzz sounds even on low volume  
1	  For fifty dollars , I expected something quality . This was the cheapest piece of junk I 've seen ! I could NOT receive even the most basic AM station , let alone FM ! I didn't even TRY the CD player - after reading the other reviews , I didn't want to waste my batteries ! Fortunately , I could return it at my local CC store . Unfortunately , I had to EAT the shipping and handling charges !  
2	  I got this laptop when I returned to college . I absolutely love it ! I love the sleek design , and easy to use keys . I spend many hours a day on it , and it never seems to overheat .  
1	  I put in a set of batteries to charge and expected them to be charged " Quickly . " I kept looking for the green light to come on indicating that the batteries were fully charged but it didn't . So , I left it on overnight and the batteries never did fully charge . I sent it back for a refund . I 'm sure it was just a factory defect but I didn't want to go through the ordering , shipping , and try it out process again and take another chance that another one might have the same problem and have to return it again .  
1	  The audio quality isn't great . I just bought a pair to replace my V-MODA Bass Freq earbuds that my dog recently destroyed . I would rather have the Freqs . If your looking for decent buds in this price range , skip these and head to the VMODAs .. trust me , you will be more satisfied .  
2	  Reason for purchase : I wanted a solution to dealing with changing tracks on my ipod touch 2g while driving because it was too distracting dealing with the " slide to unlock " , etc . Setup Pros : I didn't need to look at directions . Strap the remote to steering wheel and plug the receiver into ipod . Setup cons : None . Audio Pros : Audio quality is unchanged as I 'm going from my ipod headphone jack to the car aux in . The RF receiver doesn't get in the way of the headphone jack at all , nor the cradle I use to hold my ipod in the car . Audio Cons : I 've noticed that sometimes sound doesn't output from the headphone jack if the audio cable is plugged into my ipod before the RF receiver , but if I unplug and plug the audio cable in again the sound is back . It seems odd that it happens , I 'm guessing it has to do with the way the ipod touch detects the receiver ? No big deal though , as I simply got in the habit of plugging the RF receiver into my ipod first , then plugging the audio cable into the ipod headphone jack second and I never have a problem , and since it doesn't take me any more time to do it one way or the other I don't see this as any inconvenience once I sorted out what was going on . Remote Pros : Easy to strap on and it stays in place on my steering wheel just fine , but I wonder if it might move around some on a smoother steering wheel ( haven't tested in other cars ) . Remote Cons : In the dark I can't tell which button is which so I sometimes push the wrong one . If there were a nub on the play / pause button so I could feel where center is that would be great , but it 's not the end of the world . I give a 4 out of 5 for ease of use because of that . Over all this is an almost perfect solution for what I wanted .  
1	  I truly can not believe how bad this headset is and I have no idea why it got good reviews . After about two days of using it , a horrible background buzzing noise set in and I could not hear a thing anyone was saying to me . I threw the headset out and called our phone guy who told me to buy a Plantronics one instead . I did and so far it 's working fine . The worst part is that as I was cleaning house I found another old headset I 'd bought a couple of years ago . That too had terrible sound so I realized I have twice bought the same lousy Panasonic headset . Not sure how it happened . I guess they had good reviews and the price was right . Please don't make the same mistake I did .  
1	  Not a good product , used it for a year only get 2 bars , end up I bought the Alfa AWUS036H . I got 4-5 bars !  
2	  I have just read every review and comment on this product and I am a little worried . I spent my whole Friday night last night on Long Island ( I live in the Bronx , NY ) , replacing a Linksys BEFW11S4 v . 4 with an FM114P . I had to foot my own money for the replacement because I am the consultant who went with the Linksys in the first place . I also had to pay for my travel out there . I also have recommended similar Netgear units to other clients , namely the FR114P ( non-wireless ) . In effect I 've spent or gotten other people to spend a lot of money on Netgear hardware . I think I have something to say that Netgear needs to listen to . 1 ) There 's a hole in the ground where the natural resources for your product come from . If you are going to use steel , paper , plastic , and other metals to build something , don't squander those materials building junk . 2 ) Please respect people 's time . After all , it is time out of lives that we spend trying to get your products to do what we need . ( Research time counts too , so your website makes a huge difference . ) 3 ) Please note that there are a lot of people like me , who when time comes to spend our money or do our job , we want to get the most out of it . I genuinely like your routers because they are smarter than the rest of the stuff out there ( though built-in diagnostics and config backups are becoming more common ) . Linksys annoys the hell out me . They make routers that can't give me a heads up with a simple e-mailing of the log , they make routers that can't be mounted on a wall ( I do a lot of closet installations ) unless I drill a whole in the legs and void the warranty . Yes , I could * order * their mounting plate , but I am adamant about respecting natural resourses . The less junk and packaging the better . Now onto performance and other design comments . Your website is very helpful and easy to navigate . Your website helped me locate your products at a CompUSA where I could just walk in and it for that days work . No online ordering and no hassle waiting and scheduling . Thanks . The frequent firmware release online are a boon . It shows us that you support your product post purchase . The wireless funtion of this router does not let me see what machines are connected to * it * . I have another wireless access point and I 'd like to make sure which WAP is servicing which machine . I can get a little info with Netstumbler , but you should enable client management features . Troubleshooting a wireless connection or lack thereof needs this feauture desperately , as does the SECURITY aspect of knowing how many and what machines are on your wireless network . Thanks for the generous memory on the unit . But how much is used to process print jobs and how much is used for routing ? I imagine it is used for the task at hand as needed , but that 's my guess . Of course the print server is a great boon . I replaced an older external HP Jetdirect EX Plus ( J2591A ) , so I was a little worried about a clunky third party software printer port that would make WindeXP crop out . It worked fine on WindeXP Pro and Windows Meep machines . I did forget to go into the port properties and change the IP address of the Port * after * changing the default IP of the FM114P.Your newer units have auto MDI-MDX . Yes , we complain about wanting solid devices but we don't stop asking for features . But that little button can cause trouble if a user picks up the unit and toggles it inadvertently . I know not to do that , but the lady on Long Island does not . Dump the switch , please . If this thing is indeed burning out due to overheating , then you guys and gals have totally ignored one of the basic tenets of computer hardware design . Please put heatshinks or a fan in your units . Don't get your great product bad mouthed on Amazon because you got sloppy . The rule about heat is : if you can't keep your finger on a chip for 30 seconds , but a sink or a fan on it . Please . I don't want to go to Long Island , it 's too far . And I don't feel like opening up the unit and modding it . It 's not fair to me or respectful of my time .  
2	  Decent sound . Nothing kick - ass , but good for its value . This are just " yet another " ear-plugs . Not much of a noise isolation unless you keep the volume high ..  
1	  low cost & quick ship , but that does me no good if it doesn't fit . Not worth the hassle & expense to ship back . I have a 97 Camry with a stock stereo & this simply didn't fit .  
1	  It didn't even last 18 months . First the CD player stopped working , then the alarm stopped working reliably and now even the clock doesn't work . I 'm very disappointed .  
2	  Yes , this keyboard is small . In other places I have seen complaints about how the keys feel when pushed . The feel is different . That said , I have used the keyboard for almost half a year now , and I LOVE this keyboard . I am an adult blessed with small hands . On a regular keyboard my hands have to leave " home row " to type in numbers and have to move to the next zip code to use the function keys . On this small keyboard , I can touch type like other people do on regular keyboards . I have had to retrain my self to use only my left pinkie for the shift key and train my right hand where to go for the apostrophe / quote key , but that hasn't been hard . I also do quite a bit of work where I like to keep my right hand on the mouse and my left hand on the keyboard . With this tiny keyboard I can ALMOST reach all key combinations ( ctrl + , etc . ) with just my left hand . Being able to keep my right hand on my mouse and my left hand on the keyboard has really increased my productivity . If you are an adult with small hands , you may like this keyboard . ( My husband , who does not have small hands , says it is like typing on a cell phone key pad . It 's not . ) If you have a child who wants / needs to type a lot , they may really appreciate a keyboard that fits their hands . I have a very small work area and appreciate the small footprint of this keyboard . I keep it on top of a desk calendar and do not have any problems with it sliding around . This unusual keyboard is not for everyone , but it certainly has been perfect for me .  
2	  I purchased this for my daughter in law , I love the color . She was very pleased  
2	  Cabled four room I 'm very impress with the splitters Worked great , I have had boosters that did not work as well as this Splitter  
1	  so i 'm typing on it now . . . the clicking noise gets old fast and it 's about as fast as a cell phone keyboard . took a while to set up but it runs fine now . i haven't been able to get it running on my Droid yet . over all it 's worth it for a little less money ( used a coupon ) . I hope it 's studier than it looks . Hardcore geeks don't waste your time . Casual users better have a geek on hand for setup .  
2	  I am a golfing rules official . We constantly use radios since we have normally a few people covering a very wide area . Since we do not want to disturb a player with a blast on the radio 's speaker , we use earpieces . I have big ears , so I had to cut the bottom of the earpiece . In other words , it kinda hangs on the top of my ear , and is open at the bottom . Works VERY well , however . I have had several of the in-ear earpieces , but definitely prefer this . The microphone portion means that I can leave the radio on my belt when answering queries . Highly recommended  
2	  This power supply is exactly how all supplies should be designed and made . Being able to use only the cables / connectors you want and leave the unneeded cables in the box is perfect . Excellent . And very quiet too .  
2	  I have this computer down at school , and it has been a very good investment . At its small price , you really cant ask for a better deal . Its battery is amazing , and the performance is second to none .  
2	  Superb service and it 's a great underwater camera for a very reasonable price . I had tried a protective case over my Canon , but this works much better .  
2	  AFTER I BOUGHT MY ZUNE I HAPPENED TO READ SOME OF THE REVIEWS ON AMAZON . MOST REVIEWS THAT I READ WERE NEGATIVE AND I BECAME A BIT AFRIAD . HOWEVER UPON ARRIVAL WHEN I STARTED HOOKED MY ZUNE INTO MY LAPTOP THINGS RAN SMOOTHLY . THE ZUNE AUTOMATICALLY DOWNLOADED MUSIC FROM MY MUSIC FOLDER . MY MOTHER WHO IS IN NO WAY COMPUTER LITERATE WAS ABLE TO HOOK UP HER ZUNE QUICKLY . THE ONLY GLITCH THAT SHE HAD WAS WHEN SHE TRIED TO UPLOAD THE ZUNE SOFT WARE TO AN OLD COMPUTER . WHEN SHE STARTED OVER ON MY FATHERS LAPTOP EVERYTHING ELSE WAS A SINCH . I 'M NOT EVEN TRYING TO COMPARE THE ZUNE TO THE IPOD . THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THAT MORE OR LESS DOES THE SAME THING . EVEN MY BROTHER , AN IPOD SNOB , ADMITS THAT THE ZUNE IS A GREAT PRODUCT . IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY THE ZUNE DON'T LOOK AT IT AS A REPLACEMENT OF THE IPOD BECAUSE YOU 'RE BOUND TO FIND FLAWS . BUY IT BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT THAT IS ACTUALLY WORTH THE MONEY  
2	  I am successfully using this cable to connect my airport expressto my onkyo receiver . I am now streaming music from my mac , over a wireless ( linksys ) to the airport express , through thiscable , and to the receiver . It works great .  
2	  I recently bought the mp3run about three months ago . I was a little hesitant after reading the mixed reviews , but I thought I 'd take a shot at it . I 'm glad I did . I 'm training for my first marathon this September and the mp3run has made my runs thoroughly enjoyable . Calibration is fairly accurate with the factory settings . It allows you to custom calibrate around a 400M track if you so desire . Several reviews were negative on the software component / uploading of music . I haven't found this to be a problem . The rechargeable battery is nice . Fit is comfortable around the arm . Headphones that come with the player are fine . Pedometer sensor that is strapped on the shoe is so lightweight I don't notice it . I 've run in rain with this thing on and it hasn't skipped a beat . The only disadvantages I 've encountered is that 1-you can't run to the radio if you are calibrating a run and 2-sometimes the on demand distance button won't give readings . To offset this second problem , I 've set the device to give me readings at every mile . You can chose auto feedback at distance intervals or time intervals . That information is nice . It tells you how far you 've run , your total time running , and the current pace at which you are running . I am planning on continuing my running in the future . After my marathon , as a gift , I 'll probably get me a garmin 301 forerunner for my distances , heart rate , pace , etc . I 'll still strap on my mp3run for my tunes , however . Happy running . Just do it !  
1	  These are not what I expected based on the reviews I read & price paid . They are on the flimsy side IMO & do not sound any better than most other cheaper & flimsy headphones I 've tried . If I had to do it over again & would have spent more & bought some Grados .  
2	  The pros1 ) It charges quickly . 2 ) Nice crisp sound . 3 ) The controls are intuitive . 4 ) It comes with a nice arm strap . 5 ) Does not reset itself every third or forth use ( like the rio sport I had previously ) . 6 ) Nice and small . The cons1 ) The ear buds don't stay put if you get sweaty . I run 15-25 miles a week so this is a problem for me . Fortunately , I already had the ear buds from the Rio I just tossed . 2 ) The battery is not replaceable . If it dies , you toss the unit . 3 ) You have to use their software to load music on the player . No coping mp3 files right to the player . This was anoying to me as they seem to want you to also use their software to play mp3 's on your computer as well . Grr . This is perhaps my biggest complaint . All in all a nice unit . Beats my old Rio hands down ..  
2	  The case perfectly fits my ipod . Don't have to worry about the iPod video getting scratched or crushed . Great product with great price !  
2	  Well I got this because I wanted to keep my stock headunit . I installed my line out converter to my speaker on my back top deck of my car . I stiripped the wires and krimped them together with the line out converter so it is a secure connection and I lugged the RCA 's to the other side of the converter to my amp . Worked very well . Subs sound amazing and my stock headunit looks a lot better then an aftermarket . 5 star product . Great buy . Very easy installment  
2	  I give it a 4 out 5 stars . Pro : Cheap , does its job , easy to screw on / off . Con : Annoying reflection . It also saved my lens from destruction . My little cousin accidentally knocked down my tripod with my Nikon on it , and the next thing I know my filter is shattered and in a horrible condition . However , my lens was unharmed & good to go :)  
2	  Good price and same performance .  
2	  We bought three of these for our apartment and they worked great . Easy to assemble and they provide a great amount of light for a room . We brought them with us when we moved into our new house and they still are great lights for any room . They look great and nobody would guess the shade was plastic unless you touch it . For the price , you can't beat it !  
1	  Was excited to have gotten it but have spent a great deal of time fussing with it . Several issues with this pen : 1 ) Way to many errors , spend a great deal of time correcting errors , 2 ) Sometimes doesn't want to communicate with my computer ( s ) , spend way too much time getting it to be recognized , 3 ) On numerous occasions have lost files I 've scanned while communicating with my computer , transferring , and have never been able to retrieve them afterwards . This is especially frustrating after reading , and scanning portions of chapters , instead of using highlight pen or jotting notes , 4 ) Seems software is still living in the old 16-bit world of dos so naming files is limited to 8 characters . When I read chapters for research , I like to be able to name files something other chap1int , and 5 ) Tech support seems to be a joke , when I 've emailed them on several occasions about problems there response has been : never heard of that problem before , reinstall software . If I had to do over again I think I would have either looked for alternative pen scanner or stuck with the old fashion way .  
1	  My mom got this for my 5 year-old for his birthday . The main interest was that it is a camera , and of course it was a nice bonus that it had the " Cars " theme . It is absolute junk . We 're currently looking to see if there are any other kid-friendly cameras that will take a half-way decent picture in a similar price-range . You 'd be better off just bying a toy camera , at least there is no expectation that you 'd get a picture you could make out . If you 'd like to get your child another " Cars " toy , just get him / her a toy car . So far , I 'd say those are the only " Cars " toys we have that are well made ( assuming of course they don't have lead paint ) .  
1	  headband is very flimsy and will not stay on my head . I spend the majority of my workout holding the ear pieces to my ears . The headband piece needs to be a little more ridged . The price is right , I guess - but would not recommend . Looking for a different product .  
1	  Beware these are not Tiffen branded lens shades but ordinary Adorama brand lens shades . Adorama please update this listing .  
2	  A winning combo ! The 4MP digital camera takes vivid pictures and will allow clear enlargements up to 11 " x 14 " . The 5X optical zoom lets you get a little closer look than most 3X optical zoom digital cameras . The neatest feature on this camera is the built-in lens cap that automatically shields the lens when the camera is turned off . Kodak digital cameras are # 1 in ease of use for a reason - they are point-and-shoot simple for everyday users , but have the extra settings to tweak if you want more specific control . This camera will take compressed video clips depending on the size of your memory card . You will want to purchase a larger SD memory card than what is included with the package . With the included cords , you can hook the camera up to a TV to view pictures you have taken or have it display a live view . This is indispensible if you are babysitting . Kids love to see themselves on TV ! The printer dock Series 3 lets you dock the camera to recharge the batteries , print pictures , and one-touch transfer the pictures to a computer for touch-up or emailing . You don't need to have the computer on to print pictures . It will print 4 x 6 " or smaller multiples of a picture . The photo paper and cartridge refills are available online or from most large retailers . They aren't cheap , but it lets you have your own photo lab at home . Hard to beat the Amazon price . Camera + printer dock = pictures , prints , battery charger , and computer interface .  
1	  Bad design : once inserted into plug , it is really hard to get out . You risk getting the whole outlet in your hands . Dangerous : the second surge simply melted its plug-in . It was scary and then really hard to extricate from the outlet .  
2	  These are made of powder coated stainless steel in a flat black finish . They can be mounted to the bottom or the top of the speaker , with the part mounted to the speaker having 4 screws that come with the mount , and able to be positioned over a great variety of angles . The part mounted to the wall does so with 2 lags bolts , also furnished . The screw heads are galvanized and not powder coated , so I suggest painting them black - although they don't look bad left silver . Hardware is of a higher quality than you normally get from the big box stores . These can be mounted with a drill , screw driver , and socket or wrench . Probably takes longer to decide where to place the mount on the speaker than anything . I have had other model mounts before and prefer these above any . the metal section that goes fromt he wall to the part mounted to the speaker is a hollow tube . If you want some high quality mounts , these certainly fit that description . I have mounted KEF IQ3 's and IQ30 's with these . Even my wife likes them .  
1	  Whoever sold this to me needs to make sure the products they sell in the future , actually work right . My iPod needs to be restored all the time because it loads too slow and then isn't recognized and tells me to restore it . i am getting fed up with it and will be getting a new iPod soon and will be selling this one . The screen works and the audio works , but I have to restart it four times at least to get my computer to read it , and then it 's hit and miss from there . I am not satisfied at all with this , but it will have to do until I can get a new one .  
1	  I use several different types of cards for my camera and PDA , so I figured this would be a great thing to have . Installation is very easy , especially under Windows XP , where it it true Plug-and-Play . For other systems there is a CD with drivers included . What is supposed to happen is that when it installs is that it will maps an addition four drives onto your computer ; one for each slot . Unfortunatly it does not seem to be able to map the Smart Media drive . Even after installing the drivers off of the disc it was not able to read the SM drive . I had two of these things ; the first I exchanged for a new one after it failed to read anything . On the first one the slots weren't mounted to the face plate correctly , so when I put in the Smart Media card it fell into the back of the device and I had to spent five minuets shaking the thing out . The second one I got was mounted correctly , but unable to read the SM cards . While it could read the Secure Digital card , it erased everything on it . Fortunatly I only had a couple of files on it , but a lot of people use SD cards for storing programs or pictures , and they would have lost everything if they used this . The Compact Flash card was the only one that worked reliably , but even that one I had problems with since it was difficult to jam the card all of the way into the slot . I am very dissapointed with this device and with Viking , who usually makes good products . Most people don't use all six types of cards , so a lot of them would go to waste , so I would recomend just getting seperate readers for each card . It 'll cost more , but probably worth it in the long run . On a side note , I would just like to say that Amazon . com has an excellent No-questions-asked return policy . After I asked to replace my first one they paided the return postage and sent me a new one two days later .  
2	  this cable feels really well constructed , and works great . I 'm using it to hook up an Apple Airport Express to a stereo receiver with optical input . I like that it 's natively mini-toslink on one end , rather than using an adapter like the Belkin optical cable I have .  
2	  I love it I am in the process of putting my CD 's in categories first . Copying favorites onto my IPod and next organizing into alphabetical order with in the categories . Making it easier to find what you want . You can play in any order , repeat if you want and shuffle any or all for variety . No need for storage cabinets they are all in the changer . It is great ! SANDY SLC , UT [ ASIN : B00004RDL5 Pioneer PD-F1009 301-Disc Changer ] ]  
2	  Put your laptop screen on TV . watch movies on larger screen . Your laptop can be a portable DVD player when traveling . Great item .  
2	  I 've never understood the fantastically high prices of audiophile headphones . If you 're like me , when your buddy shows off his new $ 300 headphones , you just put them on and say " Wow , I really can't hear anything you 're saying right now ! , " feign some awe and jealousy and GO BACK TO YOUR NORMAL LIFE . It 's not that I don't appreciate good sound quality . My ex would encode all her mp3s at 96kbps .. I 'm not gonna say it directly led to our break up but it probably was a factor . These headphones just straight work for me . The cord is long , the earpieces are circumaural and the sound quality is great . They aren't quite as durable as I 'd like ( my roommate sat on my last pair and they 've developed an annoying floppy fargo hat quality to them ) , but they 're affordable so you can just buy another if you break them . Highly recommended .  
2	  This small mp3 player comes with great quality . 256mb is a lot . I can play aroung 3 hours of music on it . Sound quality is awesome . And the sound is really loud at max . You just need better headphones . Can't use the ones that come with it . Batter life is great . With one AA battery lasting for about 18-19 hours is really good . It has a good transfer rate for music download from your pc . Display is more then average , certainly not the best , but I dont have to look at the display all the time . Also , having voice recorder and fm player are add-ons . It is a small mp3 player , with good price , quality and features . Certainly for the those , who do not require huge space . I would certainly recommend it .  
2	  I purchased an extra EN-EL-3e battery for my Nikon 300D and am now using them both , one in the camera 's body and the other in the MB-D10 multi power battery back . Both batteries are working fine , hold a charge extremely well and recharge very quickly in the Nikon charger . I am considering the higher capacity battery , but will hold off as I don't feel like spending another $ 250 at this point for the additional battery capacity . I love this camera .. the absolutely best one I have ever owned . Nikon makes great stuff !  
2	  I 've been very pleased w / this little unit after a month of use now . The ability to plug it into any system and drag-drop is a huge plus for me . I don't like having to install software just to manage a MP3 player . I 've not measured the battery life but it 's impressive . I listen to audio books frequently on it and it starts up mid-track , right where I left off , very nice . The mirror finish front picks up prints etc but they wipe off w / a finger swipe and it hasn't scratched yet , seems durable .  
1	  Received the Jensen 20 " today . Eventually got it all hooked up , but no picture . I 'm the second reviewer to receive this set new with a bad picture tube . The sound worked , but it was rather muddy sounding . I gave it 2 stars because it looks good just sitting turned off . Don't waste your time on this .  
1	  The Headphone was defective , i.e. , was only Mono even though it is spec 'd as a stereo ( & I believe it is that - based on others ' usage ) .. so returned .. am going to try others before coming back to this one .  
1	  The company that said they had this Tripp Lite U022-015 15-Feet USB2.0 Certified Gold A / B Device Cable lied . They attached themselves to the Amazon description page , as one of the " others with this product for sale " Obviously , I went with them , because their price was very cheap , and since I was getting the exact same Tripp Lite USB cable , I would be coming out ahead , right ? ! What I recieved was a thin , no-name cable with nickel plated connections instead of gold , and no description of double shielding , etc . I don't know how they think it is OK to bait and switch like that . Unfortunately , I didn't have time to return and reorder , but luckily we haven't had any problems yet . We have been having connection issues , and possible noise interferrence , and really needed the Tripp Lite to help us rule out the sources of these problems , but ultimately had to ship what we were given . I could have gotten other no name brand USB cables cheaper through my regular cable supplier , had I known I would not in fact be recieving the Tripp Lite that was being advertised . I 'm not educated enough in the Amazon process of adding to a listing like this , claiming to have the same product for a price , so I don't blame Amazon . I am hoping , of course , that there is some claims department that will sanction a seller like this for false advertisement . It is in Amazon 's best interest to keep the buyers happy in a situation like this .. Again , I don't think the Tripp Lite cable is bad - I didn't recieve those to test . I also am not directly blaming or suggesting malfeasance on the part of Amazon , but rather the seller " Cmple " for thinking it is OK to claim to have something , and switch it with what they really had the whole time . They never had the name brand more expensive , double shielded , gold plated USB cable . They just used the product description page as a clearing house for their cheap cables .  
1	  It doesn't sound as solid as the stocked earbuds that came with my Zen Vision M 30GB ( I did a review of this player ) . I got it and plug it in , as soon as I did , I can hear static sounds as I push it into my Zen . I had a feeling it wasn't going to sound good . I ordered it a month ago and wonder why it didn't ship until I sent an email to amazon and they explained why and had it in two days . The pouch it comes in says Creative Zen Micro . This is the EP-480 for the Micro . Not the EP-480 for the Zen Vision M ( Which would make me think the EP-480 has an upgraded sound board or whatever in it for the ZVM.I 'm looking to order another set of headphone because this isn't doing it for me . It sounds ' ok ' . It will do for awhile . Update 4/29/07These earbuds don't have much bass . The stocked ones did . I used to be able to listen to my music pretty loud and have it sound great , but with these , It jusy sounds like crap in my ears . The only good thins about this is , it sounds ok when listening very low .  
2	  If you are planning to set up a 7.1 surround sound system ( included : 7.1 THX reciever , speakers , wires , HDMI cables , digital audio cables etc . ) at home and your total buget is less than one thousand dollars . This is a very good speakes for this kind of systems . The bass is full and solid . The surround speakers are clear . But the center speaker is little weak on the mid range . I did replaced my center speaker .  
1	  I read a lot of good reviews for this unit and decided to get one for my self . At first , I liked it ' cause of its compact , easy to use , and good price . But after a week using it , it started locking up and freeze the screen . I could not reset or turn off the unit at all . The only way to get it reset is wait for the battery to run out . It locked up every time I used after that . I 'm returnning it now . I bought this unit from outpost . com and I don't know whether they just only sell defected units over there .  
2	  I love presto products . Have used them for 59 years , My mother gave us a presto pressure cooker when we got married 59 years ago and I have had coffee pots and kitchen kettles and electric skillets and I use them all the time . Nothing can compare with presto products !  
2	  I bought this at Sears after comparing it to all of the others on display . This was our first LCD , after owning CRT and projection TVs . The Samsung easily outperformed the other available brands in the store . Viewed next to the higher-contrast model , the difference is obvious , but at home it is by itself and the contrast on this model is adequate . The best feature is the sound ; this is the only equipment I own where I can listen to CDs ( through a DVD player ) without an audible background hiss . Be mindful that if it is mounted on an inside wall , the sound will be clearly audible in the adjoining room .  
2	  I know I could use other products but if I have a printer problem due to 3rd party products , as a professional , I can't afford to pass that risk to my customers . And so , it 's an Epson printer , I only use printer paper and ink and this print pack is a good value .  
1	  This was a gift for my daughter who wanted to replace her $ 5.00 walmart headphones because wen she was in an online meting her voice level would unexpectedly drop . I purchased the Koss headphones for her from Amazon , she was very disappointed and frustrated with this Koss product - why ? They had no mute button and when she used theseKoss CS100 Speech Recognition Computer Headsetwith her computer the settings of sound and speech were all adversely affected . Unfortunately she became so frustrated with these headphones that she threw them on the ground and they broke - in addition - she had thrown out the packaging so I cannot return them for a refund . Very disappointed !  
2	  If you are reading this review , you may have already spent hours looking for a mysteriously elusive product : the decent clock radio . Look no further . I spent months searching for clock radio that would fit my ( seemingly simple ) needs . I finally found this one , put it to the test and am impressed with the results . The product is so good that I 'm writing my first-ever review . I hope you find it helpful . Product pros : - numbers are big enough to read without glasses - soft green doesn't illuminate the whole bedroom - dimmer switch available - grad-u-wake feature : the only buzzer I 've experienced that isn't jarring / ugly - small footprint on the nightstand - programmable nap & snooze durations - dual alarms can both be set to radio or buzzer - adequate radio quality - simple , easy , inexpensiveProduct cons : - noneFinally someone got all the features right . See for yourself ! Bonsoir .  
2	  I bought the box to use for my portfolio case . Had matboard cut to size and then used photo corners to mount my presentation pieces . It 's nice size , and fits perfectly in my carryon luggage . My only problem with this order was that the shipping was late and it took a few phone calls to Calumet before they resolved this problem . I 'd still order from them again , though , the product is that good .  
2	  Once again , the superior performance and quality of Taiyo Yuden . If you 're wondering what Taiyo Yuden is , it 's the manufacturer of the FujiFilm CD-R brand . I consider them to be the # 1 manufacturer because of the supremely low C1 error rates , and compatability with all sorts of players . All Memorex discs are made in low quality factories , which 80-85 % of the time produce coasters in half of the spindle . Some low quality factories include : CMC Magnetics , Lead Data , RiTEK , Prodisc , PrincoMost brands such as Memorex , Sony , Imation , Verbatim , they are all made in these factories . Maxell 50 Pack CD-R Audio is Taiyo Yuden , I buy them at Sam 's Club for 12.88 , which is cheap considering the quality of the media . They also like my LITE-ON 52X external , FujiFilm 's are the exact same thing , so I suggest you buy them .  
1	  Does Palm have a problem it 's not admitting ? My two-day old Palm IIx lost all its data this morning-garbage on the screen , no response to power button . A soft reset " restored " the unit-not the data , of course , just the factory defaults . Funny thing is , the Palm IIx replaced a Palm II which had lost all its data the day before I bought the new one . I figured the old Palm II had probably had it , but at least it had served faithfully for two years . The new Palm IIx didn't make it through two days . Palm tech support says the " solution " to lost data is a reset . Sure it is-that restores the unit to its factory condition . And then you synchronize it again to restore from your desktop . And again and again and again ? Tonight will be the third attempt to get the data I depend on every day from my desktop to a Palm II model . All I want is a Palm IIx that can hang on to my data for more than a day !  
2	  Storage is my business , this little NAS is a great piece when used with drives that are of very high quality ( spend the money on enterprise level drives ) like the Seagate ST31000340NS Seagate NS ( tm ) Series 1TB , I believe that is why some of the others on this post have lost data ( files ) . I have had it for 3 months and it works very well , and I will trust my data to the DNS-323 . Take that to the bank !  
2	  I use this on my husband 's back every night . It really keeps him loose and lessens his leg pain . As we get older , we need something like this to keep us going .  
2	  The case is lightweight but protects well . Since I have a computer with a 17 " screen , there is not much room left to store accessories such as a mouse or cord .  
1	  First , there were a couple of good things about this player . I like that it charges on the computer . My first MP3 player ran on batteries . You can also put pictures on it . I really don't have a need to have pictures on my MP3 player , but it 's interesting if you want to carry some pictures around . This is what I don't like : 1 . The package said that a full charge would last around 15 hours , but mine did not seem to last nearly that long . I 've heard that having the volume on a high setting makes the battery go down faster , but I didn't have the volume set very high on mine . 2 . On your computer , you can't rename files or play them directly on from your player . If you want to rename a file , you have to copy it , paste it somewhere else , change the name there , then copy it again and move it back to the player . 3 . This player comes with earbuds . This isn't necessarily bad , but if you prefer earphones ( like me ) , you 'll have to get a pair from somewhere . I used the ones from my old MP3 player .  
1	  If there were a zero star option it would have gotten it . I have to say , I am more than disappointed with the quality that came with this toner . Not only is this a terrible and useless cartridge , but it 's the second one that I have received being that I already returned the first one that had the same issues . As the first reviewer says , there are black marks on both sides of the page and when you hold the pages you get toner all over your hands . Any type of picture or photo has giant gobs of toner and the roller on the toner cartridge is covered in toner . Do yourself a favor , spend a few more bucks and get a toner cartridge that will work . If the company would like to try and rectify itself again , I am open to it , and I will rescind my review , or at least reconsider , but I have to say I have my doubts as this is the second time that I have tried to get a cartridge that works .  
2	  This thing works great in my attic . I get 100 % picture on all my channels and I was able to get rid of the huge ugly antenna on my roof . This antenna may not be for everyone [ .. ] . Its a great website that helps choose the correct antenna and which direction to point it , the map feature allowed me to get the set up right the first time .  
2	  Highly recommended for laptops . Even though it has a " connect " button , never had to use it . Just plug and play installation . No need to download / install drivers . Used it with Win 2000 and Win XP . Pros :* Solid responsive mouse * Just like any other mouse * Cordless so no tangled wires around you * Optical so can be used on ( just about ) any surface * Small USB receiver * Cute carrying case with separate pouch for receiver * Used it , without any issues , with my wireless internet connection * Easy to replace batteriesCons :* Might be small for a person with large hands & / or long fingers * Just 2 button mouse * Not aware of any way to program the " buttons " ( for " left handed " persons ) * Slightly heavier ( because of batteries ) compared to a general optical mouse .  
1	  Trust me , you don't want this machine . The print quality is mediocre at best and the document feeder is non-functional . I have to stand over mine and feed one page at a time , which can be tricky because if you 're too fast it puts two pages onto one and if you 're too slow it ends the transmission . Get a REAL fax machine . I will .  
1	  The sound quality on these ' phones is maybe just barely acceptable for the price , but the extremely flimsy construction is just pathetic . The plastic material on the bands near the cups is really weak and will break eventually , probably sooner then later . I 've had to preform surgery with tape a number of times and they 're still falling apart and I know other people who bought them and ended up in the same position . It seems like you 're paying for the cost of the name Bose . But if you want something that 's not going to fall apart in 6-8 months , look elsewhere .  
1	  This has been the worst experience with any product I have purchased in my life . Let me start off with the troubles of this TV , and then I will move on to customer service . 1 ) Very , Very , poor black levels . So poor that when watching a letterbox movie , during dark screens , the letter box bars on the top and bottom actually wash away . Bothered me so much during horror movies , especially . It looked like some one was holding a flashlight behind the screen . 2 ) Small horizontal lines appeared while playing games using component cables on component inputs . 3 ) Would loose picture on RGB input ( my PC ) when I would switch from different inputs . I would have to turn off then on to regain a picture . Now customer service . I do not have the stamina to type my entire experience so I will make it short and sweet . Purchased the TV in June 04 . Made my first complaint in June 04 . After arguing about the issues , ( non-issues according to LG ) , they finally agreed to pick up the TV in Dec 04 . Tried to fix but could not . They actually said they did not know how to fix it so , they finally agreed to give back money in mid Dec 04 . As of this posting , Feb25 , 2005 , I have yet to see my money . Every time I call it is 7 to 10 days before I get it . At least 7 different people have told me the same thing . I will never ever buy any Zenith or LG product for as long as I live . I will also never recommend , unless they are my enemy . Joel  
2	  I just got this camera a month ago and I am satisfied with it . It has a lot of features despite its size . And for point and shoot I can say it 's a great buy , comparable to other power packed cameras , it even takes better pictures sometimes . But I just had to give it a 4 because I thought I could do more with it . But you can't do much with the settings since it has it 's own default settings for certain conditions . But over all it 's a great camera . If you 're just after taking normal pictures and you want something sleek , this is definitely a good buy .  
2	  I have a couple pairs of $ 100 + headphones that I 'm happy with but I got these as a gift and was actually shocked when I first tried these out . The sound is really well balanced , not tinny and without bass as some cheap headphones tend to be . It won't rattle your brains with bass but I think has the perfect presence for prolonged listening . You can adjust the EQ on pretty much everything now so if you want more bass , you 'll just have to turn it up yourself . It feels like you 're getting a lot more for your money . Construction is all plastic and fairly solid . The padding around the earpieces could be more full as my ears touch the insides but , hey , for $ 20 , you can't expect everything but I definitely didn't expect this much . All I can say is , for $ 20 you cannot go wrong with these . Sure they have some flaws but for budget phones , these top my list . Oh , and don't bother yourself too much with the reviews from the self-proclaimed audiophiles out there , nothing ever meets their standards . Take a chance on these . You won't be sorry . ( The five stars was based on budget level phones , not everything in one category . Don't crucify me over it . )  
2	  I bought this camera for my husband . He loves it and it is very easy for him to use . The picture quality is excellent .  
2	  This is a great little camera ! the photos are quick and clear . processing time is a lot less than my last olympus . This little gem fits in your pocket nicely for quick easy access while on the go . Great little camera .. love it !  
1	  I just got this product today , just took it out of the package and I 'm already unhappy . The sound quality is a joke . Even the simple " click " sound when I open a page on a website sounds terrible . I can't get the microphone to work even though I know its not a problem with my computer . The headset I bought to replace this one with was about as broken as it could possibly be and the microphone on that one still worked . It doesn't make any sense that a brand new headset wouldn't work properly . I started to lose interest in SONY a few years ago when my Playstation 2 was stolen and I realised that I never enjoyed any of the game on it enough to buy a new one . Since then , I 've still respected SONY 's products as being of high quality .. until now .  
2	  Excellent sound and I 'm not even through the break in period yet , I 'm using an ancient Onkyo amp , and they are playing 128kbps without any major distortion unless turned up 3/4 or more . I think since I only have 50 watts going to the speaker this is excellent . I highly recommend these little things .  
2	  This product is great . It secures the Zune tightly to my arm , never comes loose , and stays clean .  
2	  I wanted to have a set of good headphones . These were affordable and work really well . I just wish they were a little more stylish . For the price I paid , I can't have expected much .  
1	  MarginMart sent a black generic cable - not the Belkin item they pictured - I think they just expect people to roll over because of the price . You can find the real thing for a buck and a half more elsewhere .  
2	  We Bought this For Our Daughters Room , As we did not want to spend a ton of money .. to our Surprise this is an Awesome TV / DVD Duo ! ..  
2	  Not an audiofile but these sound great ! they leak sound like crazy though . Perfect for at home listening but not really the best for listening out and about .  
1	  No driver support for Windows Mobile 2003 , Linksys supports told me " They are working on a driver , please check the website for updates . "  
2	  so far , i am very pleased with the performence of this scanner . i have yet to explore all the options that are available , but i have turned numerous color prints of my travels into 1024x768 size wallpapers for my computer .  
1	  I bought this printer as a home office unit since it has the same print heads and specifications as the larger professional quality 1270 and 1280 which I have in my studio . This printer has been fraught with trouble . Mainly with the inks . It clogs almost daily and I have to run it through the cleaning cycle which consumes the ink . I end up replacing the ink cartidges almost monthly and all I 'm printing is email and quick brochures . You 'd be better off heading over to the Hewlett Packard printers . On top of all of this , good luck getting anywhere with Epson customer service .  
2	  I haven't had the opportunity to listen to it a great deal yet , but it has good sound given that it 's a " boombox " . I have found that inserting the receiver is not as easy as the instructions make it sound . It seems like it 's going in the slot fine , but it 's not sitting just right , so you have to remove it and try again . Usually only takes me 2 times to get it right and the more I do it , the better I get at getting it set on the contacts exactly the way it needs . Overall , a good product though and I know I 'll get a lot of use out of it !  
1	  I don't get MIcrosoft they think this Zune can take over the Ipod . Who would wan't to buy a bulky player that looks like that old classic football game from the 80s or like something they gave away on Let 's Make a Deal . Why did they pick the color of dookie as a color option . Another stupid thing about this is that you can't use Microsoft 's own Media Player or music from other places like itunes and such , you have to download Zune 's music and player . Also why is it that you can't use this on a Mac . But if you own a Mac you would wan't to buy a Ipod which comes in different sizes , colors and GB storage . It takes such a long time for the Zune to transfer you music files from your media player to Zune 's one . That sharing music between other Zune 's is lame as well becasue how many people do you know that even own a Zune . So what if this has a radio there is nothing great on the radio anyways . If you wan't to buy a mp3 player get a ipod there is a reason there the top selling one and no i am not a Mac / Ipod fanboy or a employee of Apple .  
2	  I HAVE USED THIS PC CORD FOR MORE THAN TWENTY TWO YEARS AND IT HAS NEVER FAILED ME YET . CONTINUE WITH THE GOOD WORK !  
2	  This cable really came in handy . No problems . I would buy from again . This was used for the tv to go to the blue ray player . Every thing sounds great .  
2	  Good speakers for the money . Would be good for someone who wants highs and has woofers for the lows . A good replacement for stock premium speakers . Not good for someone looking for good deep bass . I am pleased with them and would buy these again . Can't beat the price for what you get .  
2	  The headphones are alright .. I like the way the volume control is .. but when you put them on , it 's another story . Your head will look like a light bulb or something , I laughed when I saw myself in the mirror with them on .  
1	  [ [ ASIN : B000PCBVA6 TomTom ONE XL 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator with Maps of the U.S. and CanadaCame with old maps . Tried to download new ones , spent 2 hours on the phone twice . First time ended up with Guam only . Second time ended up with " no maps found " . Maybe its just me , but I would look at other GPS 's .  
1	  Have other Toshiba products and have been very satisfied . this ones no good . Serious tracking problem on VCR playback made it impossible to watch since I purchased it . Received notice of the defect from the factory sometime ago but they never did anything about it . Will probably trash it and look for a different brand .  
2	  My new Corsair USB 2 16GB Flash Voyager Drive is the best ! I use it to transfer and store my high-definition photos . I couldn't be happier with the quality and price from Amazon . com ! . It 's fast and I haven't lost a bit of data . I highly recommend it . I love this , I am able to take everything with me rather than drag the computer along . A bargain .  
2	  I absolutely love the key board . I have just had carpal tunnel surgery and it is great .  
2	  Great quality , great look , great product . Sound from these fills my large apartment living room / kitchen / dining room space with ease ! I 'm super pleased with these bad boys .  
1	  i have a creek right behind my 1 1/2 acres and we have always had bug issues . i got the stinger at bjs , worked great the first day and thats it ! it wouldn't come on the second day , i just returned it and i 'm getting a flowtron instead .. i 'll see if that lives up to the glowing reviews .  
2	  i have both a 77mm B + W UV and CPL , both fits perfectly , the canon , just fine , no play , my 72mm hoya , first time , a little bump but after that , fits just as good . There 's nothing much to read about this item , since it 's only a metal ring . Fit and Finish , very good .

2	  Perks up quickly . Coffee tastes fantastic . Product has been used now for about two years and still going strong . Might buy a second one as a backup .  
2	  At 20 USD nothing beats CX300 in my experience and it 's also almost good as my old EX71 from Sony which cost 50 USD at the time .  
2	  These headphones sound awesome ! When I first bought them I was amazed by how much bump these things put out . They 're great headphones not much more to say . I give it 4 stars because the inside of the ear cup is hard . It 's made out of plastic and is covered with some mesh like black fabric which starts to hurt my ears after awhile . So if you have big ears then these definitely aren't the epitome of comfortableness . In conclusion , good product just a bit uncomfortable if you have big ears that protrude a bit .  
1	  Despite that Altec Lansing promotes that the IM9 is compatible with iPod Nano ; be advised that it does NOT fit the 2nd generation Nano model ( with the aluminum case ) . This misleading information left me wishing I could have given the product a zero rating because the omission made the product unfit for it 's intended and advertised purpose for me . It might be a great product but I was unable to judge it 's performance because I don't own an iPod the IM9 would accommodate . If like me , you have a 2nd gen . Nano , you 're out of luck . I 'm surprised to find only one review that mentions this incompatibility . I returned the IM9 to Amazon for credit .  
1	  This is a very compact unit , using only a single AA battery for power , with a built-in USB connection for downloading music . Unfortunately , that 's where the compliments end . I 've found this device to be unreliable and generaly flakey . Some music files cause playback to simply freeze , requiring a " reboot " ( unplug the battery ) to continue . Often the unit will simply stop playing " for no reason " . The tiny amount of power available from the single battery is insufficient to produce any kind of volume , even on very efficient headphones . Operating at higher volume levels ( more than 3/4 of the way up ) results in the unit shutting down after a few minutes . Even the most efficient external speakers elicit the same result . I would expect that all of the other MuVo TX family members are just as flakey , but this is the only one I 've tried . I wouldn't recommend this unit or any of it 's siblings to anyone .  
2	  It 's so good ! We have a beutiful experience with the music when we hear the music in all my house where ever I walk around it .  
2	  This CD player is the absolute best . Our first one lasted 15 + yrs so we were delighted to find another @ Amazon . So very simple to use & great quality .  
2	  I got this for my BlackBerry Pearl and this product has worked perfectly . Being a serious student I do not get a lot of opportunities to watch TV , but this card has held up to 12 hours worth of high quality video that I record on my computer and watch on my phone when I get a little time . In addition , it holds around 100 mp3 files I use as customized ring tones for the 75 + contacts on my phone ( yeah , still need to look at the caller ID for most of them ) . Great product , especially for the price compared to wireless service provider retail stores and electronics stores .  
1	  I bought the VGA to RCA component RGB cable but it does not work at all . Waste of money and efforts . VGA to RCA Component RGB Cable - 1.8M - M / M  
2	  Ive never had one issue with Western digital caviar drives , and I used them the last 10 or more years , since I never shut my machiens off they rn 24/7 and the WD caviar drives just run perfectly . I bought 2 of these caviar blue drives , now a 3rd one , the first 2 came in a nice little box with instruction manual not a little piece of paper , and mounting screws , it was well packaged and it just looked great , you definitely felt and could see its a quality drive .  
2	  This case is absolutely perfect for the Sony Handycam DCR-SR45 . The case is well padded and holds the camera , charger / cord , USB cord , audio / video cord and a spare battery . It is packed tight and all fit snugly . Unfortunately , there is no room for the Sony Operating Guide . However , the complete Operating Guide comes on a CD with the camera in pdf . format . I placed the file on an inexpensive thumb drive and slipped it into one of the pockets inside the case . In this day and age a computer is always close by . I also placed the file on my Dell Axim Pocket PC . The case is very compact which is what one wants in a handycam anyway . It comes with a detachable padded shoulder stap . No major negatives so far with this case for this Sony Handycam model .  
2	  A few have complained that the color on this model Palm is dim . I can tell you that mine is not dim at all . In fact , I was pleasantly surprised at how bright it is both with the backlight off and with it on ! Mine was made in the USA , and I understand that some may be made in another country . Perhaps the ones not made in the USA are dimmer ? Or perhaps only the first run older ones had that problem and it has since been fixed . These are just guesses since mine is absolutely not dim at all ! I have owned several Palms previously ; II , IIx , IIxe , and V. The m505 is by far my favorite Palm so far ! The color screen is wonderful . It makes the unit much more user friendly and easier to read overall . It 's quite easy to read with the backlight off under normal lighting conditions such as under a desk lamp or in a meeting room , etc . When the need arises , you can turn on the backlight ( such as in a very dark room like in bed at night or when you just want the screen to look really bright ) . Under both circumstances , the screen looks wonderful and is quite readable . The color makes it more fun to use and I 've downloaded some shareware games to play for the true arcade experience , in a palm size ! The m505 is blazing fast ! It 's noticeably faster than any of my previous Palms ! It also comes with the latest Palm OS 4.0 verison . It 's also very quiet . I was expecting the color screen to buzz but I can hardly hear anything at all with the backlight on and off ! I would recommend this model because it 's one of the smallest Palms available ( which means you will conveniently carry it with you everywhere ) and it 's got color , which is a great asset since most software applications nowadays are optimized for color . I do not miss my greyscale non color Palms at all ! If you are concerned that the screen might be a bit dim like other reviewers have reported , I suggest either buying locally so you can see the actual unit you are getting , or purchasing from a vendor that will let you return it . All I need now is a wireless modem setup and I 'll be doing full color web-browsing and emailing from my Palm ! You gotta love it !  
2	  I looked long and hard for a protective case for my Macbook that I could use in a backpack or other bag . I couldn't be happier with this sleeve . Fits the Macbook perfectly and has just the right amount of padding . Also the zipper is protected all the way around on the inside to prevent scratches . This is exactly what I was looking for and would recommend it for anyone who 's looking for a protective case , not a full blown bag .  
2	  This is the camera i was dreaming of . easy to use . beautiful bright pictures . I really got some great service . The seller was in touch with me and he made sure the camera arrives on time and Im fully satisfied . looking forward to purchase some more from this seller .  
2	  I bought this Recorder on Amazon for $ 19.99 and have never had any problems with it . The recordings are extremely audible in SP mode and I especially appreciate the noise filter switch which filters out background noises . You can't go wrong with this one .  
2	  For what this camera is selling for on the used market it 's a bargain . It is simple to use , takes good pictures , has a lithium battery , uses an SD card and these are all things positive . On the so so side I find the view finder off to the left awkward but could get used to it especially if you are left eye dominant . The camera body is a little on the small side which gives you about a two finger grip . My other Pani is the FZ47which has room for a three fingered grip and it has a center mounted viewfinder . If you can't afford the FZ47 then this is a good value on the used market . Or if you want a smaller version then this is agood choice . Recommended  
1	  I 've had no issues with these discs being recognized by Nero or XP for burning the data side . BUT , the label side leaves a lot to be desired ! The labels I DO get to print fade , but the biggest issue is wasting my time burning the label , then finding out most of it did not burn in and is not visible ! I 've had to get into the habit of burning the label first , then IF IT IS OK ( only about a 50/50 chance ) , I then burn the data side !  
1	  The Harmony 550 is an " all right " but not a great universal remote . For the price tag it demands , there are better options . Shortcomings :( 1 ) Ergonomics - the buttons are just plain too small . And if the size of the buttons isn't trouble enough , the non-spatial row of buttons design is a second cause for annoyance . In other words , you never get an intuitive feel for the button layout , and it results in daily occurence of user error .. even after 8 months of ownership . And it 's nearly impossible to navigate with the lights in the room dimmed . ( 2 ) Ease of configuration - you can get up and running in crude fashion in 15 minutes . Getting the remote to really work like the one that came with your TV / DVD player / Receiver takes about 2.5 hours of trial-and-error optimization . It turns the volume up & down in much larger quantums than the OEM remote , and will often change one too many channels when channel surfing . Through loading and reloading and resting the remote , these types of kinks can be reduced after a 1-2 hours of debug . But they can't be eliminated altogether . Logitech took on a big challenge in making the king of universal remotes . This one has software optimization and ergonomic problems that other Logitech remotes don't have .  
2	  This is really a good buy . You get a lot of value for an excellent price . While not the smallest or compact , the optics are great for a product at this price range . The binoculars are easy to use and quick to adjust .  
1	  I used to use the tape player and an adapter in my truck to listen to satellite radio , the tape player died and i didn't want to change the radio out .. so i bought this .. the sound quality is horrible ! the highs are so muted i had to turn the treble all the way up and he base almost all the way down .. .  
2	  Best SD card I have ever owned . Significantly faster then several other so called " high Speed " cards I have tried . You get 4GB of capacity for less than $ 40 . A great value !  
2	  The pentax optio x , it ? s a great camera for some many reasons , but the most important for me , is that i can get great pictures from me an my couple , without asking help to any other person to hold the camera ..  
1	  The product did not work out of the box . Spent 2-3 hours on phone with tech support before they decided that it was defective . Not as easy to set up as they say . Amazon was great in that they sent out a new one without hasseling me about any thing . Dlink wanted me to pay shipping for defective product to return it to them :< ( . Havent tried the new one yet .  
1	  These maga size ear buds don't fit in my ears ! I thought these are made for sports but when I tried these on , I wasn't even moving much yet and these fall off ! seriously ? For 12 dollars plus shipping fee to APO addresses , these are not worth at all . Don't buy these .  
1	  This clock worked great for me for about 5 months . One morning in a sleepy haze while trying turn off the alarm I knocked the clock on the floor and now the digital dispay no longer works . It seams that an alarm clock should be able to take a little more than that .  
2	  Many rollers today are very wide and cumbersome , but not this bag . It is taller than the average roller therefore making it skinner . It fits on the floor-board , in the backseat of a car . I especially like the top-entry design for laptop loading versus a side entrance . THe front panel is large and very organized . I am very happy with my purchase . The reason for 4 versus 5 stars is that one of the wheels gets stuck while rolling - not too smooth , but it corrects itself without you having to touch the dirty wheels .  
1	  I wish I had read the reviews first ! I too received theitem with an empty cleaning fluid bottle ! Bummer . ButAmazon is giving me a complete refund and paying my postage !  
2	  Lowepro Vertex 100 AW backpackVery good backpack for the price I paid . I got this as an open item from a camera store with all the attachments and padding . The original price is a bit too high and I would not have paid that if I had not found this deal . The bag is fairly bulky , but very well padded . There are alot of straps the just kinda dangle around and look messy . Unless you are using the Waist belt and chest strap for a trek , it looks fairly goofy . There is also no way to remove the waist belt when not in use . It would have been nice . The exterior is great . Very rugged construction and the weather proofing is a great feature . The fact it is all black and grey is also nice . The Tripod holder is very loose when not being used and bounces around alot . This can be removed when not in use and the straps that assit can also be removed or hidden . The two front exterior compartments are very useful for holding extra memory cards and lense filters . Great feature with easy , one handed access . The laptop compartment is so so . I do not have a laptop so I use this for storing my tripods pan-handle . It works nicely . It would be a slight problem if I did have a laptop because there is no specific compartment outside the camera gear space where you can store a wireless mouse , charging cable , ect . I personally dont want those items coming into contact with my camera , lenses and flashes . Now for the main compartment . The padding is nice . It has cloth sewn onto the walls to keep the main areas " rub safe " . I keep three lenses with lense hoods attached ( 18-55mm w / h , 50mm , 70-300mm w / h ) securely tucked in without fear of them falling or tumbling around . I also keep a point and shoot and 2 2.5 " externals tucked into one of the adjustable pockets . They fit nicely and do not fall out . I can keep everything I need to do outdoor photography with me at all times and not need to worry about running out of room . This is a great backpack for people who intend on being outdoors for long periods or expect unfavorable weather in their journey . If you are a sun shine only shooter and dont have alot of equipment to lug around , this backpack may be a little to much for practicality .  
1	  I ordered a 10-pack of these at the end of this past summer . Only 6 of them seemed to accept charge ; the other four seemed to be mere paperweights . I tried charging those multiple times but still got a voltage reading of zero across each of them . ( On the other hand , the 6 that work seem to work somewhat well . ) I have been using a Sunpak Rapid Charger .  
1	  These are by far the worst headphones I 've ever had . Indeed , I promptly shipped them back to amazon . What I find most surprising is the lack of quality coming from Philips , which is generally a quality brand . The sound quality is anything but . Weak and devoid of timbre , it 's a shame they 're on the market . As for the noise canceling feature , it 's non-existence . If presenting the listener with a faint but consistent low-pitched squeal in attempt to mask outside sound is Philips ' idea of noise-canceling , then I suppose it 's effective . Although I may be an audiophile and demand high quality from companies who deem themselves serious contenders in the world of sound , I 've had cheap WalMart phones better than these .  
1	  this modem is a piece of junk i cant give it . 5 of a star or i would buy a motorola  
2	  These cables are fantastic . I bought them because I did not feel like being strong armed into $ 30 at big chain stores so I took a shot . After setting them up to my HD cable and XBOX 360 , I asked my girlfriend to randomly switch the hd connection from these cables , to my cables purchased for $ 50 at the store . I asked her not to tell me when she did it . I thought I would notice at least some noticeable difference . Honestly , if my other cables were not 12 feet , I would not know which cables were the expensive and which were cheaper . Absolutely fantasic !  
2	  I only needed a bag that would hold my Rebel XT and one zoom lens . Fits perfectly .  
2	  Not much to say , works perfectly . Also works for Pontiac G8 . Since this adds length , it could rattle against door , or hit window , recommend you attach to door with wire ties or Velcro .  
2	  Well , I don't have much to say about this product , except that it works well and it does what it promises .  
2	  It is a very solid product , not looks like cheap plastic , and I trust Belkin as a reliable power-bar provider , works very well .  
2	  I was looking for an inexpensive way to play my ipod through my home theater system or any speakers and i found it here .. great sound quality , takes about 15 seconds to connect .. had no issues EXCEPT finding a way to connect it to a stereo that doesn't have 2 auxiliary in connections , only one audio in connection .. i 'm sure there 's a way to connect it to that as well using other connections , but this worked perfectly with the home theater system it was originally intended for !  
1	  i bought this mp3 player about 6 months ago . at first it was great . now , its very disappointing . it never turns on when its supposed to . also , it is very difficult to charge . first , the device has to be turned on to charge . second , even if it is plugged in , it wont always charge . third , if the battery gets too low , it freezes the device . there have been many times when i have had the device plugged in overnite in the hopes of taking it with me the next day on a long trip . but the next morning , i find my battery is still dead , and the device is frozen . the only feature i like about this device , is the rio dj . it creates autoplaylists , based upon decade , genre , most recently transfered song , etc . this would be an excellent product , if the battery would work . but since it doesnt , its impossible to use .  
2	  I own a graphic design business and we just recently purchased 4 of the 243T Samsung 24 inch flat panel monitors . We can just say this , this is by far the best monitor we have ever used . We cannot find anything wrong with it at all . We can highy recommened it . PS we had tried the Apple 23 inch and while it was very good , in our unanimous opinion , the Samsung still viewed its colors , text and over all picture quality the best .  
1	  After owning a Teac tape recorder since 1983 that I was very happy with , I wanted a second one so I purchased this unit . What a dissapointment . It cliked and clanked when the tape engaged . It didn't have a earphone jack-my fault , I should have looked closer . After a couple weeks of use it wouldn't accept the audio feed in order to record so I returned it .  
2	  OMG , why did i wait so long , this is the most incredible and fun computer i have ever owned . you just plug it in and it works perfect , the screen is gorgeous , i dont see how i can ever go back to my PC . I love my 6 ipods and have been waiting to try a mac and finally took the plunge . My only regret is not doing it 3 years ago . If you are thinking about it , dont , you will love this machine . I would have gotten the 24 inch but they did not have it in stock . A totally amazing machine , that is also fun , and i dont have to worry about viruses . It even set up my home wireless system seamlessly and shared my itunes music from my pc just like that , i did not even have to click a button . most impressive  
2	  Appothecary Style CD Storage Cabinet , WalnutWe have too much media and not enough organization . This unit addresses our needs . The 325 capacity unit is comprised of the 4 and 5 drawer unit plus the two shelf unit . They stack and are shipped in two separate boxes . They are secured ( and I use that word loosely ) with two small metal clips that you screw to the back to attach the two . Once attached , a lift and tilt could upset your setup . Some sites list this as being made of oak . It is not . It is solid wood ( probably birch ) , and is made in China . The finish is very attractive with a rustic look . The finish is not entirely even , so this piece isn't " too perfect . " It fits our casual lifestyle well . The legs give the unit a less bulky feel and are a nice touch . The drawers slide in and out easily , and are interchangeable . The walnut finish is lighter and has more red in it than I would have imagined based on my knowledge of a walnut stain as well as the photos and images found on the web . It is easy to assemble with a screwdriver and a fair amount of muscle . You might want to get some tap in feet protectors , as the bare wood legs are in direct contact with the floor . The item is well packed , and it needs to be , given the long haul from China to CA and then to IA via UPS ground . The packaging is sturdy with a double thickness cardboard and strategically placed fitted Styrofoam . If not for both of those features , this item would not have made the transit safely , as the box was crushed , dented and torn in multiple places . This is a good free-standing storage solution for CDs , DVDs and even VHS tapes . It blends well with most furnishings and its relatively small footprint makes this a good solution for our media storage . Reasons I did not give 5 stars : Finish color , fragility of top-to-bottom attachment , lack of floor protectors .  
2	  I 've had the camera for a month now , and I really enjoy the quality of pictures I 'm able to take , particularly when I lower the ISO and take the picture in RAW format . Very easy to use .  
1	  Yes this printer is pretty cheap and prints well , and the ink cartridges are cheap . That said , I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone because the ink runs out really really fast . The cartridges it takes only hold 10ml of ink ( most hold at least 17ml and some out there hold up to 50ml ) and won't print more than 250 pages of text .  
2	  I got this for my sony dv tvr33 . It comes with multiple tin foil type converter lenses for its 37mm size . Each lens has its own pouch and a lens cap for both the front and back of the lens . Does what it says , do not notice any degrade in picture quality . You will have to zoom in a little for the zoom lens to get rid of black edges . Couldn't ask for more especially for the price .  
1	  Whenever this card reaches 70 degrees C , it will lock up playing games like Call of Duty 4 on Vista . It doesn't matter which nVidia driver is used , the problem is that this graphics card will always lock up with the driver not responding . I 've seen other GeForce 8800 Ultras reach over 90 C and no problems but this one locks at 70 .  
2	  I have taken pictures of everything from my son 's birth to the lava fields in Hawaii . All pictures came out beautiful . Very easy camera to use .  
2	  I am in the process of installing this in a 1996 Honda Accord EX . Still waiting on a radio install kit . However , I hooked it up to make sure I had the right connections first . It was a very noticeable improvement over the stock player , even with the original speakers . It played CD 's very cleanly , and the radio reception was no problem . It has a " loud " button which accentuates the treble and bass , and the music was much better with this feature on . It 's a little " bassy " for a pure talk program , but all you have to do of course is press the " loud " button off . It also comes with a wafer-thin remote control , with mute button , if you feel you need it . CD 's go right into the front , with no flip-down face . It does of course have a detachable faceplate , with a case that came with it . It also comes with its own mounting bracket and removal key . It doesn't have an equalizer , but the music sounded very good anyway . If you want a basic cd / radio at a reasonable price , I would recommend this unit . A word about installation : very straight-forward for the do it your selfer . It is a single-din unit . I would recommend that you do get a wiring harness from Circuit City , etc . that fits your particular vehicle . That way you do not have to cut the original vehicle harness which could come in handy if you wish to replace the new unit or put the old one back in later . You may or may not want to get another harness which plugs into the new harness and then to your Panasonic . However , that 's another expense ( that you are going to be charged with at Circuit City , etc . which advertise " free installation , " but charge in the fine print for parts ) . I am going to hard-wire ( solder ) the new harness to the player 's harness with came with the unit . You can just use electrical tape of course for the connections , but I prefer to solder since electrical tape can become stiff , fall off , etc . on down the road . Using the harness adapter , the wires matched up by color code perfectly to the player 's harness . Depending on your vehicle , you may need to get a radio kit . Overall though , not hard at all .  
2	  the online pictures do not do this camera justice .. the black color makes it quite elegant , and the combination with silver and the svelte body is downright sexy . Sony has always been known for their design edge , and the T5 does not disappoint . the 2.5 " LCD is large and bright , updates instantaneously with movement , and shows lots of detail ; the matte coating helps the viewing under bright lighting . the operation of the camera is simple , because Sony has put very few buttons on the camera itself ( most of the options will be via the internal menu ) . by the way , changing shooting options are updated live via the screen , so it 's nice to get a glimpse of how that photo will look at EV + 7 vs EV-7 . with any camera , the most important part obviously is the actual quality of the photo . with the T5 , you 're getting 5mp of very nice , clear photos . however , cameras with the internal zoom design tend to produce softer looking results , and T5 is not excluded ; this means that at 100 % viewing , the details are simply not as sharp as some of the cameras that use an external zoom design . ( keep in mind that the tradeoff is very fast start-up times , slim and small body , and less " conspicuousness " - nothing screams " tourist " more than when those zoom lens start popping out . ) but 70 % and below , the pictures become very sharp and clean , and realistically , no one is buying this camera and expecting to use the photos without resizing , so the lens design can't really be considered a flaw . that said , 8x11 prints are very do-able with this camera . the colors are very natural , though perhaps comparatively cool if you look at Nikon or Canon ( it 's a matter of preference ) ; if you 'd like warmer photos , you can boost the saturation inside the camera menu . under less than optimal conditions ( ie , indoors ) , camera shake becomes a problem , especially with today 's diminutive models . T5 doesn't have a image stabilizer , so getting sharp photos indoors can be tricky , and the softness problem ( from lens design ) gets worse at the same time . i 've figured out 2 ways around it . one , you can depress the shutter button completely at once ( not the half press focus , then full press shoot ) ; the camera will quickly focus and take the photo , and since you 're using 1 motion , you decrease the chance of hand movements . the other is to use Burst mode : take 3-4 photos at once , then choose the best . using this latter method , usually 60-70 % of the results i get are quite sharp and suitable for printing . camera buying today is tricky business ; you can't go by just the brand , since even famous makers produce flops ( eg , Nikon 's S series take pictures that are notorious for their blurry corners despite the reputation of the maker ) . the Sony T5 does not disappoint overall , because it doesn't have that many flaws ; except for the lack of an image stabilizer , it has all the features a point-n-shooter ( and even more advanced photographers needing a 2nd camera ) will want and handles almost all lighting situations well , producing clean , pleasing results . at the end of the day , a camera is only as good as you learn to operate it ; learn the weaknesses of a particular model , figure out how to bypass it , and you 'll get great results everytime . with that said , in terms of pricing , design , and photo quality , it doesn't get much better than the T5 ; you 'll not only get good photos , but look good taking them too .  
2	  This remote worked as advertised . I needed a learning remote to use with a new Olevia HDTV , since other remotes have no codes for it . It was easy to use the learning feature and it worked perfectly with the various features of the TV and the cable box . The only thing I had a problem with was the programming for my combination DVD / VCR unit . It learned the VCR functions , but I cannot use it for the DVD functions . I would still highly recommend this reasonable priced remote .  
1	  One side of the earphones short in and out , you have to hit it to get it come come back in . The sound and reception is great when both sides are working . Maybe I just got a dud ? Seems liek a nice product if it worked correctly . Wouldn't buy again though , the distributer said refer to manufactures garuntee , what a hassle .  
1	  i was excited about getting retractable earplugs that costs so little , but there 's a reason for why it 's so inexpensive . the earplugs are too small and fall out very easily . the sound quality it awful . i had to turn the volume WAY up to hear sound and when i did , it was very tinny . i just wasted 13 dollars on garbage . i expected more from panasonic .. now i 'm never going to buy earplugs from them .  
2	  This little DVD player is great . I have the old Ipod so I can hook it up and play the music or the movies on it , and it charges it while it plays . There was some concern about the battery that comes out the back put its really not that bad , we had a polaiod DVD player before and the battery was on the bottom so if you have it in your lap , it tends to get very hot , not with the Audiovox . The battery lasts a long time and i had a Venturer DVD player that quit playing the DVDs , but I could hook up the audio cables to the Audiovox and then have two TV screens for the kids to watch . Easy to use .  
2	  I was looking forward to using this lens and it didn't let me down . The pictures I 've gotten with it are very sharp and surprisingly balanced in light and color . Only drawback : weight . This is not a lens to carry around or take quick snapshots because , in addition to the weight , which makes the camera too heavy to hold adequately , the focusing can be a little tricky and easy to lose . Once I got used to these " difficulties " I really enjoyed this lens . The zoom is outstanding ! I would recommend buying a tripod w / this lens-which is , by the way , a real value for the money .  
1	  The E-500 is my first DSLR . I have owned it for about two years . Overall , the camera is not too bad for what it is , but you need deep pockets for any upgrades . Also , the kit lenses are soft ( fuzzy ) . Later , you will find out that the " high grade " upgrade lens are soft , too . This camera is about the same level as the Canon Xti . If you have ever dreamt about learning professional photography , go with Canon or Nikon and forget about this camera .  
2	  was up fellas . i have the older version , 2300hcx , its chrome and gold . take the flames of and its the same amp .. i have had this amp since 2001 still running .. had it to 2 t1 fosgate 12s and was running at 1 0hm , before it was kicker cvr 12 's and earthquakes 15 's it did not matter this will run any sub .. capacitors are bandaids you need high amp alternator .. my lights still dim with cap .. so i took one t1 out and running one at 2ohms in a 2.00cuft ported box . still hits .. i have always ran the amp at a 1ohm load .. 2nd time running at 2ohms . had to bridge the kicker cvr 12 's to 2ohm or i would blow them .. grab this if you can . i paid $ 1200 for mine . you set it up right you 'll need ear plugs like i do ..  
2	  [ EDIT Sep / 2008 ] : Some sellers on Amazon have started charging $ 230 or more for this HP LaserJet 1018 printer ( with shipping ) , and that 's an outrageous price ! Make sure you buy it from a seller who keeps the total price $ 150 or under , or else you are paying too much . If you are willing to spend $ 200 + , then you can find a better printer than the 1018 in the same pricerange . To find the cheapest deal , just click on the " used & new available " link next to the price to see what the other sellers are charging . [ END OF EDIT ] I 've spent hours researching cheap printers on computer forums , and I 've found that most people rate the HP Laserjet 1018 as the best of the cheapo laser printers ( Nov-Dec 2006 ) . In my personal experience it turned out to be much faster , quieter , cheaper , and higher quality than any other cheap ( under $ 150 ) printer I 've ever used , and I 've tried about a dozen in that price range ( mostly inkjets , but also some lasers ) . The cost per page is much lower than with inkjets , even if you refill your inktanks yourself . And you only have to replace the ink every few thousand pages on the laser , instead of every few hundred pages on inkjets . And HP 's reliability is better than the other brands of laser printers . Unless you need to print in color , this is the way to go for a cheapo printer .  
1	  I ordered my new 46 " Sharp TV to watch during my surgery recovery . However 6 weeks after my " new " TV was installed , it still does not work . I am being told the AV board needs to be replaced however getting the Sharp warrenty contractor to replace it is almost impossible . I am now being told it will be another 2-3 weeks before it is fixed . Sharp customer service is nice but obviously has little stroke when it comes to making the repair happen .  
2	  I 've been using this product for about a month now ( with a Sony Walkman MP3 player ) . It works really well , especially considering how economical it was . I travel about 18 miles each way to work and don't have to switch stations because of interference . It 's not always perfect quality , but the moments of fuzziness don't last long enough to bother me . It is easy to switch stations when needed . You just push the illuminated button and it switches to the next station . I did not give it a full 5 stars because I would like more options for radio stations . It is preset with about 8 stations ( starting at about 88.1 ) . I would like to have the ability to use another station at the higher end , if necessary ( like 107 ) .  
2	  I never thought TV was so important that you had to take your home channels with you . But , when stuck in Europe at a trade show and stuck watching CNN International and BBC , a customer told me they go back to their room and watch Sling Box . TV from home ! Bragging about their DVR recordings , etc . I got home and bought this . It works great . Set up was a little tricky though . I get FoxNews now everywhere and can watch Video On Demand , DVR ( TiVo ) recordings anywhere with broadband access . Only negative : the video quality is a " 6 " on a scale of 1-10 .  
2	  It 's hard to find shower radios in the stores these days . I guess everyone 's listening to their iPods in the shower . This radio works well : It gets good reception , is plenty loud enough , and has large , easy to use buttons . Downsides : 1 ) It would be nice if it had more preset buttons ; 2 ) C'mon people , $ 70 for a RADIO ? I can't figure out what it does that makes it so expensive . For that kind of money I want something extra , like a built-in Pez dispenser . Something .  
2	  This is just a good product . Worth buying it if you wish to buy a stand for your tablet . Correctly fits and completely adjustable .  
1	  I was very disappointed with the whole experience . Firstly , the machine never worked and also the accompanying directions and brochure was most inadequate and very poorly written . Furthermore , it took great effort and persistence to finally return the songwriter for another machine . I hope my next experience is not as trying !  
1	  Thanks for the fast delivery , however , once installed in my laptop the battery only lasted a short time , @ 3 days , and it will not accept a charge .  
2	  Pros : When I first switched from film to digital I lost the ability to use 400 and higher ISO film . Most digital cameras do badly at high ISO but the FinePix S6000 produces good pictures at 400 ISO and usable , but grainy , pictures at ISO 's as high as 3200 . This is really valuable when taking pictures indoors , in the woods , in twilight , or any other situation in which light is limited . It is also helpful when photographing people who close their eyes to avoid flash ! I also very much like the manual zoom , the ability to automatically bracket exposures , macro mode , and other features . Cons : It lacks a real antishake feature , the viewfinder can be hard to use in some situations , and it is a bit heavy . Face detection does not always work as desired , particularly with faces in profiles .  
2	  I 've had this TV for a month now , and am impressed with its picture , style , and the number and type of connections on the back of the TV . It is a " Best Buy " in my book , plus March 2007 Consumers Reports gave the Olevia a pretty good review . There are two annoyances that leave it short of five stars : ( 1 ) the TV is not able to be controlled by my Comcast-provided remote , and the Olevia remote can't be programmed to control all the features of the cable box - therefore I have to use two remotes ; ( 2 ) there is a piercing blue light that emits from the on / off switch when the TV is turned off , so if you have this TV in the bedroom , you 'll have to put a little piece of black electrical tape over the light because it is so uncomfortably bright .  
1	  I just received mine , expected it to house a WD 2TB drive , but nothing worked . I tried USB and all FireWire ports , nothing works , nothing is detected in Windows . Before I purchased the drive I compared prices online , and on NewEgg 's page of the product only mentions that 3TB support would require a firmware update which I can find nowhere on Macally 's website . Anyway , I am returning the product immediately .  
2	  We purchased this wireless headset for my mother and it works great . My family has hearing problems so this review is not going to be as much about frequency response / sound , even though we feels these do sound great . My dad can't hear distinct sounds from the new TV 's speakers when the volume is up where my mother listens to it . However , when my dad put the headset on , he was amazed at how he could hear every distinct sound with crispness ! My mother can now listen to the TV without having it blaring .. the headset has it 's own volume control . Now my dad can read in quiet and mom can still watch TV . We may get another headset for dad so when he wants to watch TV he can hear it . The base stays plugged in and it turns off automatically . If the TV is off it shuts itself off after a few moments ( green LED on base transmitter ) . Also , my parents have a typical flat ranch style house and these work clearly and flawlessly anywhere , even outside or in the garage ! There are only a couple of issues , which are very minor . Unfortunately the tune dial is next to the volume dial , so to fix any mix-ups we put some clear tape over the tune dial once it was tuned in good . This will prevent unintentional tuning when changing the volume control . Another thing is the headset is not rechargeable . It just takes a pair of AA batts , so be sure to turn it off when finished . This hasn't really been a problem . We are still on the first set of batts . These are great . I think they sound good and the work well . Great buy for the money !  
2	  The reception did seem to improve a bit but the picture still appears grainy when you look closely at the screen or on network stations . The picture appears to have improved more on the cable channels . I think if I connect the amplifier closer to the dish as opposed to closer to the receiver , I should get a better picture . If you bought a high quality big screen TV but wonder why your picture is fuzzy / grainy , this might be the answer for you . I thought the satellite was the problem and I almost got digital cable which is much more expensive . I am glad I found this product first .  
2	  I also was very skeptical when I bought this speaker , but I have been pleased with it . I wanted something small and light enough to fit in a backpack , but that would allow me to listen to music in a hotel room or a campsite . It has been perfect for this purpose , and it takes up about as much room as a paperback book . It does not provide the quality sound that speakers 4 times the price do , but it is great for the price . Since it can also act as a charger when plugged in , it saves you from buying or carrying that item as well . It also can be powered by 4 AA batteries . It lasts about 16-20 hours on my rechargable batteries .  
1	  I purchased this SD card and used it once . After downloading the pictures the first time , the card was no longer usable in my camera .  
2	  While it wasn't the eaisiest thing to install ( requires some computer smarts ) D-Link did something that LinkSys could not : make a wireless print server that works as advertised . One word of advise for mac users : to use this printer , open print center , and use IP printing . Be sure to pick your correct printer model , or something close . If you don't , you 'll have a pile of jibberish printed . Overall , very nice device . It feels magical when you see your printer printing not near a computer , and in your kitchen ! You can place the printer anywhere in the house . If you want a print server , and are willing to put up with the hassles , this is the one to get .. but be sure you have at least one computer whiz in your family .  
1	  i cant use this item for the year and model i ordered it for . a double din head unit for a 2001 nissan altima , even if it had fit i wouldent have used it for the cheep look and construction .  
2	  I 'm very happy with this router . Lots of security settings and I can have my kids internet activity log emailed to me . Connectivity is excellent . One thing I 'd like to mention : The router came shipped with firmware version 1.32NA and didn't work well with it . It froze about once a week and I had to reset it . I upgraded to firmware 1.33NA and ever since it works flawlessly . So if you buy this router and have problems upgrade the firmware and it will probably fix it .  
2	  This is a perfect product . Pro : at lower of its speed it 's still making cool for my laptop . quiet runningadjustable speeda light on / offbeautiful designflexible usb connectorCon : Nothing at allSum : cheap price that it can't be beat ..  
1	  Initially , like everyone else here I thought this printer made excellent photo prints . I even got over the shock of how often you need to replace all 6 cartridges - $ 13 each ! Well I use this printer not enough to warrant these costs and it added up quickly . Well after 17 months , it stopped working all together . Just blinked blinked and blinked away - operator error . The cherry on top of all of this - I called Canon and was charged a $ 10 phone call to tell me I need a $ 100 printer head . I reread ALL the material and no where - no where did it say this was going to be an option down the line . VERY SHADY CANON - I will NEVER ever buy another product , let alone printer from you again . Horrible customer service and personally I think NOT writing about the printer head in the literature should make them liable .  
1	  samsung CD-R 's are aweful ! I thought CD-R technology had been around for so long that it must have matured so that it really didn't matter which manufacturer I bought from . So without thinking I bought Samsung CD-R 's . Was I taught a lesson ! I never had any trouble with burning before I used Samsung . With these new Samsung CD-R 's , sometimes my recording / burning fails in the middle . Sometime the burned CD 's become unreadable after a day ( stored in normal condition with all my other CD 's ) . Some blank CD-R 's make so much noise when I insert them into my driver . After inspection I saw that some of the CD-R 's are not flat ! And they rub against the top part of my driver when spinning ! In three words : DONT BUY IT .  
2	  Simple to use and very accurate . The only thing I don't like is that there is no on / off button . It is always on and ready to weigh unless you unplug it .  
2	  This battery is in every way a replacement for the battery that came with my Olympus camera .  
1	  I have a 2004 cavalier , with no onstar or satellite radio . The stock end just barely fits in , this adapter isn't big enough to actually be plugged into it . Sort of disapointed . Hope it works for other , but NOT the 2004 Cavalier .  
2	  Maybe I 'm a printer-holic : I have an Epson Photo R200 for photos . I have a Primera Signature Z6 for CDs ( fantastic printer , by the way ) . But I needed a fast , reliable printer for handouts and training materials . I work in Illustrator and InDesign , and PostScript Level 3 was critical . This printer is genuine Adobe PostScript ( not " PretendScript " like other printers ) , and it shows . But , beyond that , the entire experience is superior : the manufacturing standards are splendid ( great fit and finish ! ) , and the set-up guide is perfect-you can't go wrong . The little ink sticks are shape-coated so that even a trained squirrel could load them . The " walk-up installation " that finds Windows boxes and says " hello " automatically is wonderful . It 's speedy , sharp and chock full of great features I didn't know I 'd love . I highly recommend this printer !  
1	  Connections were loose inside .. so had to take cover off and inspect since it didn't come on after plugging in . Not as pictured . Foot is plastic not metal . Tires are thin and not substantial .. toy like junk . Didn't inspire that keeping this was going to go well . Returned it the next day . Bought a Sears Craftsman . Quality was better and it worked without fiddling or hasseling around .  
2	  After having used both a an FM Transmitter ( bad ) and a cassette adapter ( tolerable ) , the Scosche FM-MOD01 was everything I had hoped for ! It takes a little effort and know-how to install but the result is WELL worth it ! And the fact that it 's under $ 20.00 was just icing on the cake !  
1	  This printer is incredibly frustrating to use ! I had an earlier version that worked better until it jammed and then broke . This one is terrible - it either doesn't pick up the paper so it thinks it 's out of paper , or it jams , or there 's some other error . It is a piece of junk . When it does work correctly ( and this is after 1 1/2 hours of messing with it ) , the pictures are beautiful . However , the ink and the paper are not designed well enough to work together despite Kodak 's claims - I always run out of ink before I run out of paper , and you can't purchase just the ink without the paper . Overall , I have to say that few things aggravate me as much as this printer . The reason I 'm giving it 2 stars instead of 2 is because when it works , it works great . But it 's such a piece of crap that it rarely works . I wouldn't give this printer to my worst enemy !  
2	  Nothing much to say about ram except that installed without a hitch and has been working great ever since . A good upgrade to any computer that needs it .  
1	  I absolutely loved my camera at first , but then , like other reviews , I was cursed with the black screen of death . The camera was on , the lens was out , but the screen was completely black . When I attempted to take pictures despite the black screen , they didn't turn out . Nothing seemed to fix this problem . I do have the warranty , but again , you have to pay to have this repaired . The worst part about this is that the screen decided to go black while on my trip to NYC and I had to buy disposable cameras instead . Don't let this happen to you !  
2	  I originally got this laptop from Gateway around 7 years ago , it 's been the goto computer on the go for me ; I 've upgraded the memory last year to 1GB and since then it 's been able to handle any of the day to day stuff that most people would do ( word processing , e-mail ) without experiencing any slowdowns ; I 'm running WinXP SP3 with the usual anti-mal , anti virus softwareI can work on my digital photos with freeware programs like GIMP , and even play some older 3D games ( although , if you push it , it will get hot and lead to a system crash , making a reboot necessary ) , it handles 2D games without issuesAll in all , it 's more than paid for itself , i would upgrade it more with a bigger HD if i could find one at a good price  
1	  Just drop this 2005 ancient thing that weighs more than 2 lbs . Adorama sent me this crappy one that doesn't read SD cards , so this camera has that problem after a while , and the LCD screen doesn't have live mode which is a must after Sony A350 . On D5000 Nikon is so slow and really hard to see esp . using 2x teleconverters , macro or any other manual lens with aperture . At this price , go for Samsung which has better acquarium and flower shots than in reviews , Sony with polarizer filter . For sports or nature shots or anything else , D50 is a piece of crap .  
1	  I purchased this scanner in Feburary of this year . I was pleased that the installation was easy and for what I used it for the quality of the scans were Ok . Unfortunately , the scanner totally quit functioning after 12 scans ! So the referral on this product being a " work horse " wasn't true im my particular case . In contacting the manufacturer , I learned that the effort of getting this scanner fixed wasn't worth the scanner . I would not recommend this scanner or manufacturer to anyone .  
2	  This is the first high definition LCD I have purchased . After doing quite a bit of research , I ordered this Toshiba 42 " LCD television from Amazon . I used Amazon 's free delivery , which Amazon said would take about two weeks . However , after four days , I used the tracking link and found out that the television had been scanned into the local Eagle facility . Rather than waiting for Eagle to call me , I called Eagle and scheduled a delivery time for two days later . So , the delivery ended up being much faster than I originally expected . The televison itself has a very good picture as well as good sound . My cable company could not get me hooked up to high definition for several weeks , so I found an old " rabbit-ears " antenna and hooked it to the Toshiba , and I get five HD channels from the local broadcast stations . ( You can have cable service and an antenna hooked up at the same time ; you use the remote to go from one to the other . ) The HD picture quality is incredibly good ! The picture is extremely clear , and the colors are crisp and bright . I am very impressed . Overall , I am very happy with this Toshiba televison .  
2	  This is one of the best detectors on the market , and has saved me from many huge tickets ! I never go on long trips without it , and plan on using Bel for any future purchaces of radar detectors .  
1	  The LaCie d2 250GB external drive DIED less than 24 hours after I got it ! I edit video on a Mac , and had loaded approximately 40GB of footage onto the new drive before shutting down for the night . The next morning when I turned everything back on , the LaCie d2 made a modest " click " sound and became a useless $ 200 paperweight . * edit * LaCie 's tech support e-mailed me within about 6 hours to suggest a few things I could try , none of which worked . While no contact numbers for LaCie come with the actual product , I was able to find a customer service number via their website . I 'm relieved to say I was connected right away with a human being , and the person I spoke to was really helpful in guiding me through their defective returns procedure . I was not charged for shipping the item back , nor was I responsible for insuring the package . I also should note , at no time did LaCie push me to exchange rather than refund my money . THAT is rare these days . * edit * The drive shipped quickly back to LaCie , and they refunded my money in exactly 7 business days . In fact , the only downside to the whole experience was the product itself .  
2	  This great to have . Used it this weekend on a camping trip . All items protected and not water leakage . Would buy more of them .  
2	  I needed a basic wireless router while away from home . My room had DSL but in an inconvenient location . I found the D-Link DIR-615 in a Navy Exchange ( at $ 20 more than Amazon ) and bought it because I couldn't wait for shipping . It was very easy to set up with the CD wizard and I was completed in just a very few minutes . I had to call tech support right away because I could not connect with the router and there was one option in my wireless setup that needed to be unchecked , but since that , it has performed flawlessly . And , support was easy to reach and friendly . So far I have nothing but praise for this unit and essentially agree with the CNET review of this item . It is small and lightweight enough to fit in my backpack along with my notebook PC and will be with me on all future travels . I am very satisfied with my purchase and despite being overpriced where I bought it , is still very reasonably-priced for a quality N router .  
2	  This thing was invented for guys like me . All my favorite songs on 1 unit , and I 'm not lugging around a clunky CD player .  
2	  vivo en buenos aires , argentina , en el barrio de Belgrano , y el alcance es espectacular - Desde Federico Lacroze , se escucha perfecto en el norte , hasta Congreso , y en el sur hasta Dorrego . Muy recomendable alternativa para celular , cuando uno se mueve cerca de la casa y tiene chicos .  
1	  Don't buy a D660u . A week ago I bought ( from Amazon ) a new Canon D660u . After I hooked it up I noticed that the underside of the glass had grime on it and needed to be cleaned . An email from Canon in response to my question asking how to clean the underside of the glass , I was told that it is not consumer serviceable and needs to be forwarded to a warranty station . An email to Amazon brought a VERY prompt reply and an offer to Air Express a replacement unit or issue a refund . The second one arrived in two days and is just as contaminated . Looks like a grimey gray wavey film on the bottom of the glass that simply needs a two second cleaning . What a shame that this simple that task is not something Canon thinks ever needs to be done . I 'll be returning this one too ( at Amazon 's expense ) . I sure like dealing with Amazon , though . They 're number one in my book . Canon on the other hand , sucks .  
1	  I love it . at first i wrote a review as to why people are spening so much on this thing , then my friend got it . after playing with it for 10 min i was dying to get one and got one the nezt day . i love it < 33333  
2	  Put these in the fairing of my Valkyrie . Vast improvement over stock speakers . Just bought them for the rear as well . Very good product .  
2	  lo necesitaba mucho , a un amigoes de gran ayuda para pescadores aficionado , por eso lo compre , para disfrutarlo mucho .  
1	  This is probably one of the WORST products I 've bought in a LONG time ! It should be something found in a dollar store - no joke ! PROS : - No batteries needed - Smaller than a bread boxCONS : - No volume ( earbuds laying on the table could produce as much sound ) - Much larger than it seems in pics - Dangerous to the delicate jack on your MP3 playerAfter reading many of the reviews on here where people complained about the low volume , I thought they probably just had high expectations . I went into it with very low expectations . I expected that this thing would not get any louder than the speaker on a cheap cell phone . However , this thing is SO LOW that my earbuds can produce as much sound from as far away . I can put this up against my ear at full volume and it 's still barely loud . I typically keep my volume restricted at about 75 % on my iPod . I had to unrestrict it and crank it up to 100 % to hear sound in a quiet room . Once you pass about the 80 % mark on an iPod , these speakers crackle ( but still don't give you enough sound ) . I am convinced that the company used the cheapest speakers they could find . I know that the speaker in my cell phone is about 10 times louder , eventhough it 's about 1/4 of the size of each of these two speakers . The size of this piece of junk is actually much larger than it appears in photos . It 's about 4.24 " w x 1.5 " d x . 75 " h . It could have very easily been about half of its size ( the housing is just a big empty cavity ) . The jack is mounted rigidly ( no swivel , etc . ) . So , it 's always sticking out and when plugged into your MP3 player , it will act as a huge lever , applying force that can easily break the solder points on your MP3 player 's audio jack . I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT ! All I wanted was to listen to podcasts through this thing with my iPod on the table right next to my keyboard - this isn't going to cut it , at all !  
2	  i bought it for my friend to use because she wanted an 8G . It has Enough space to store thousands of pics .  
2	  I 've had a HP 1200 Laser Jet printer for a number of years . I especially liked it because I could put twenty-five or more envelopes in the paper feed tray and print away . After fifty-five thousand printed sheets , I accidently put a clasped envelope in the printer with the clasp on the wrong side . This action caused the printer 's print roller to be damaged and from that point forward it put a unwanted mark on every page printed . In spite of this mistake , I liked the printer so much , I ordered a used printer of the same model from Amazon . com . That printer arrived with thirty thousand copies made . I am now on my way to infinity with the resolve to avoid clasped envelopes in the future .  
1	  The idea is great , but the whole deal is based on the premise you are actually going to be able to receive the signal . Unless you pay the extra $ 40 for the antenna headphones you can forget about listening to the Inno on headphones . When the Inno is docked , attached to the antenna and not moving it works great . I got the car kit for another $ 70 . I get a signal about half the time in the car . Still get numerous drop outs making it impossible to actually record a song . So it 's $ 399 for the actual Inno , $ 70 for the car kit , $ 40 for the antenna headphones , 12 month subscription to XM at $ 12.99 a month for another $ 156 plus tax ( 7.85 percent where I live ) for a grand total of $ 717.20 This stinks of price gouging and XM greed .  
1	  This player is AWEFUL . Mine stopped playind DVDs today .. everything . I got it on the cheap cheap cheap .. and that 's what it is . Aside from the noise while playind discs , the remote interface is FAR FROM intuitive and the remote runs on a watch battery . Do yourself a favor and buy a Toshiba .  
1	  I had such high expectations for this product . I was looking for a product that would allow me to listen to the music on my pc throughout my house . What I got was a huge disappointment . The first strike against this product is that you cannot use your PC speakers when you are using the transmitter . I read a lot of product descriptions on different websites , and not one of them mentioned this " feature " . So , as soon as you switch to the transmitter , you need to replace your speakers with a FM radio right next to your computer . Another huge disappointment with this product was the range . I was able to pick up the signal on a radio that was a couple of feet away from the transmitter , but that 's it . The radio in the next room could not find the signal . A FM Clock Radio that we have couldn't pick up the signal even when it was placed right next to the transmitter . My stereo system one room away was able to pick up the signal for a few minutes , and then lost it . I tried several different frequencies , including available frequencies at the low , middle , and high end of the range . They all performed equally poorly . Setup and installation were very easy . The interface for changing the broadcast frequency is very simple and easy to use , but unfortunately , this product is a turd .  
1	  I read all the warnings and advice in these reviews and was careful to follow the directions exactly . SkipDoctor still did not work . It took a lightly scratched and smudged music CD that was nonetheless working fine and ruined it . ( That will teach me to " fix " what isn't truly broken . ) Fortunately , I made a backup of the disc beforehand , so it was not a total loss , but I will not risk any more expensive media on SkipDoctor . For those of you who were able to make it work , congratulations . You are luckier and / or more patient than me . I 'll be returning my SkipDoctor immediately , before I 'm tempted to " give it another chance . " I have enough coasters lying about my house , and they didn't cost me $ 15 + apiece .  
1	  I received this bag as a gift less than a year ago . It has not been exposed to extreme temperatures , excessively packed nor has it been overly used .. almost hardly used . Both zippers have now been broken in half on the main storage compartment as a result of me opening the bag . For a Canon product , even if not expensive , I would have expected better .  
2	  The 6 Megapixel Nikon D40 is targeted for those who want a relatively compact and light camera yet having most of the important SLR features . The D40 is priced reasonably ( cheaper than D50 / D80 and Canon Rebel XTi ) . In my opinion , if you are still considering whether to get a point and shoot camera or a DSLR , the D40 will be a better choice than any point and shoot camera , by far , even those with 8MP or 10MP . But if you are already deciding to get a DSLR or you want more control of the picture taking experience , then I would recommend you to also test the D50 and / or D80 first before deciding to buy the D40 . I want you to make sure that you know what you will get ( and not get ) with the D40 . Don't get me wrong though , the D40 is an awesome camera , and I don't think you will regret buying one . There are some limitation with the D40 which shouldn't bother most people , for example , the D40 doesn't have dedicated button to change picture quality , white balance or ISO settings ( which generally only professional / enthusiast will care ) . Once you understand ( and accept ) its limitation , the D40 is a potent and exciting photography machine . Just like all its ( DSLR ) siblings , the D40 powers on instantly and take pictures with almost no shutter lag which are the major advantages of a DSLR over a point and shoot camera . In addition to the P , S , A , M mode , the picture quality of the auto settings ( auto , child mode , landscape etc ) are also very good . With 2.5 frames per second you can capture movement progress in sports like football , basketball , baseball etc . Also great to photograph your family or child ( child mode ) . The D40 is a great all around camera . Some notable new features : 1 . Auto ( no flash ) mode . Without this mode the flash will pop-up ( on all other pre-programmed mode ) even when you don't want to use flash ( which can be annoying ) . The internal flash will not pop up automatically with the P , S , A , M settings . 2 . In camera editing capability such as black and white , sepia and some filter effects etc . While sounds gimmicky , these features are useful especially for those who doesn't have Adobe Photoshop ( or other image editing software ) . To date , D40 is the smallest and lightest among all the Nikon DSLR ( even smaller than the Canon Rebel XT / XTi , however the D40 is more ergonomics ) . I believe that choosing a camera that fits comfortably with your hands is important . Therefore , I recommend people to test the camera before buying ( even if you want to buy online , please do go to a physical store and test the camera first whenever possible ) . The D40 has only 3 ( horizontal ) autofocus point ( 5 for D50 and 11 for D80 ) . If you know " The Rule of Thirds " , the additional AF points above and below the center focus point ( available in D50 and D80 ) are handy to help create the horizontal third line . However , the 3 horizontal AF point in D40 is still helpful to create the vertical third line . Also one can focus with the middle AF point and after the focus is lock then move the frame upwards / downwards to create the horizontal third line . Just make sure the exposure level is still accurate when you move the frame after you lock the focus . About the 18-55mm II AF-S kit lens : A good lens producing sharp photos ( though not a very fast lens ) . Also decent for close-up / macro photography . Lens uses internal focus technology and focusing operation is silent . A very decent kit lens . Lens compatibility : Notice that with D40 , autofocus function will not work for non AF-S / AF-I lens . If you already have non AF-S / AF-I Nikon lenses and want a backup or replacement camera , you will be better off buying D50 , D70s or D80 . If you buy the D40 , it will be convenient to stick with AF-S and AF-I type lenses . I 'm not sure why Nikon choose this route for the D40 ( whether to enable smaller size camera or from now on Nikon will only make AF-S lens compatible camera ) . There are a lot of good Nikon AF-S lenses ( price range added : low , medium , high ) that are fully compatible with the D40 such as : - Nikon 18-55mm f / 3.5-5.6G ED AF-S DX ( L ) - Nikon 18-55mm f / 3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX ( L ) - Nikon 18-70mm f / 3.5-4.5G ED IF AF-S DX ( L ) - Nikon 18-135mm f / 3.5-5.6G ED-IF AF-S DX ( L ) - Nikon 18-200mm f / 3.5-5.6 G ED-IF AF-S DX VR ( M ) - Nikon 55-200mm f4-5.6G ED AF-S DX ( L ) - Nikon 55-200mm f4-5.6G ED AF-S DX VR ( L ) - Nikon 70-300mm f / 4.5-5.6G ED-IF AF-S VR ( M ) - Nikon 12-24mm f / 4G ED IF AF-S DX ( M ) - Nikon 17-35mm f / 2.8D ED-IF AF-S ( H ) - Nikon 17-55mm f / 2.8G ED-IF AF-S DX ( H ) - Nikon 28-70mm f / 2.8D ED-IF AF-S ( H ) - Nikon 70-200mm f / 2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR ( H ) - Nikon 105mm f / 2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR Micro ( M ) - And several other expensive prime tele / zoom lens like 200-400mm , 300m , 400mm , 500mm , 600mm . High priced lens ( $ 1000 + ) are usually pro level lens which usually have better construction , faster ( f-stop ) , and produce better quality picture . However , often times , lower price lens will serve your needs just fine . I think it is important to know what you want to use the camera for before deciding which camera and lens to buy . Image quality of the D40 is very good which is # 1 factor that I look for in a digital camera . Here are the pros and cons of the D40 in my opinion : Pros : 1 . Nice out of the camera result picture quality2 . Affordable price3 . Compact size and light weight4 . Large and bright 2.5 inch LCD5 . 2.5 frames per second6 . B / W , Sepia , several more in-camera editing features . 7 . Instant power on , fast autofocus and no shutter lag8 . Noise is acceptable at high ISO settings . Auto ISO settings available . 9 . Great 18-55mm II AF-S kit lens . 10 . Great battery life ( 400 + on a single charge . 1000 + if flash is not used ) . 11 . Auto ( flash off ) mode available12 . 1/500 flash syncCons : 1 . No direct button to change QUAL , WB and ISO settings2 . Grip comfortably but might be a bit too small for some people3 . No top LCD and no front command dial4 . Autofocus will not work with non AF-S or non AF-I lenses ( such as the 70-300m G and 50mm f / 1.8D lens ) 5 . No AF / MF switch ( have to use the switch on the lens ) 6 . Only 3 autofocus point7 . 6 Megapixel ( More Megapixel needed to print larger than 12 X 18 at 300 dpi ) 8 . No night landscape mode in pre-programmed settings9 . No in camera image stabilization ( like Sony and Pentax ) but Nikon has lenses with it ( VR ) . 10 . No depth-of-field preview buttonIn conclusion , the D40 is perfect for those who want high quality pictures , more control ( than a point and shoot camera ) , and have a DSLR experience ( instant power on and no shutter lag ) , without having to carry a bulky camera . And unless you are shooting sports / actions professionaly ( which faster focusing processor , faster frames per second and larger memory buffer might be needed ) , the D40 is pretty much all you will need . Happy Photographing !  
2	  Exactly as advertised . Works perfectly with my Mac Mini ! Great construction and solid fit .  
1	  I bought two of these routers brand new , and a family member bought one as well . ALL 3 of them are defective . If a computer on the network reboots , the routers compeltely shut down . Also many services , like email , would not work through the router . It makes little sense . But these routers are junk , they simply won't work , and I reccomend everyone AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS . You might as well go buy a brick , it will work just as well on your network . ( NOT AT ALL ! )  
2	  This is simply a great card . Time has proved it by the fact that two product cycles have gone by and it still beats Nvidia 's offering . Simply put , this DX9 card is way way faster than any Geforce 4 card , allowing high resolutions with the best image quality . Plus the 9700 is the first and standard DX9 card , while Geforce 4 is Dx8 generation and dog slow for dx9 . Now Nvidia is trying to come out with Geforce FX , and this card is as fast as the fastest one of those , while not being noisy or bulky . The " midrange " nvidia offering is dog slow , half again slower than Radeon 9500 even ( with advanced features enabled ) . Their image quality is worse also . By the way , if the card isn't working for you then something is wrong with your system . ATI can't help it if you install it incorrectly or have other hardware incompatibility / instability . I bet those people have [ inferior ] power supplies or didn't connect the power supply to the card correctly . Now there is also the 9800 Pro which is even faster than this .  
2	  BE WARNED - that not all of these players come with the DVI cable . I purchased my through Amazon . com last week and mine did NOT come with a cable . I purchased the $ 100 Monster Cable . The picture quality of the player is impressive , especially in 720p mode . Quite a bit more information is transferred to the television in that mode than in 420p and there is noticeably more film footage displayed . Overall , the player is probably worth the investment if you have a DVI capable television . Just remember , this player may cost you $ 229 plus $ 100 if you are one of the unlucky ones ( like myself ) that does not receive the cable in the box . Amazon and Samsung really need to rectify that inconsistency considering how expensive that cable is .  
2	  I 'm not an audiophile , and rarely play CDs , and MP3s using my computer . But , I do listen to a lot of programs over the internet , and these speakers are great for that . Spoken words are very clear , back ground noises are discernible , but not distracting , and subtle modulations in tone give new color to speech . What music I have listened to sounds good , but I generally use my stereo system for that . I don't have much room for computer speakers either , and these are a perfect fit . Delivers sound that I 'd expect from a much larger , more expensive speaker .  
2	  This power strip is perfect for your workbench . I have multiple battery chargers plugged into mine for my cordless tools .  
2	  Ok , I purchased 2 HDMI cables , and had them shipped to my home , for less then $ 7 - TOTAL ! The deal with 1.3 hdmi cables , is that they are industries standards for 1080p . You will get the best out of you blu ray using this HDMI cable . The $ 120 cable you find from Monster is 1.4 , it is laced to support internet and networking , and is also supposed to be that base for 3D , when it comes out this fall . But this is all " supposed to be . " There is nothing in your home today that you will need 1.4 for , so save yourself the time and money a buy this one for a penny . Hey .. here 's a penny for your thoughts .. how stupid do you feel for buying a Monster cable for $ 100 ? You don't have to answer that .  
1	  Cheap and great in the beginning . Worked like a charm . Never had to change the station despite driving through 8 different states . However , after the first 6 months , it became very picky and had to be constantly wiggled to get the reception . Now , less than a year after purchasing it , it no longer works . Every time you 'd hit a bump in the road it 'd get knocked out of transmission because it had become unbearably picky . Required constant wiggling and adjusting during the last 6 months of it 's approximately one year ( but actually a little less ) lifespan . Not recommended for long-term use .  
2	  Film I received was not near the expiration date like others have said theirs was . I received the film at the end of 02/12 and it says to develop it by 01/14 , so that 's a fair bit of time . However , it was not Fujifilm Super HQ as was advertised , it was Fujifilm Fujicolor . I 'm no photographer but I assume Super HQ is better than Fujicolor and I wanted what I thought was better film for my the cameras I was wanting to test out ( that are older than I am ) . Two stars off for not selling what they advertised , but one star back on because not only do I not care that much ( not a professional - or even good - photographer ) but it also arrived two days before the first estimated arrival date .  
1	  Device only displays when connected to USB or AC power . Picture quality is horrible , appears to have high density red / purple filter - makes color photos appear as washed out negatives . B & W look a little better but not acceptable . I bought one for my wife and foolishly bought another for my Mom before first one arrived . Based decision on 4 + stars on Amazon site . If negative stars were an option , I 'd give it a -5 stars .

1	  Seriously , don't buy this thing . I 've had 3 . I bought two for a multi-display set up and they both died within a year . Samsung replaced one and it died 6 months later . Update : I 'm now on my 4th 305T . Samsung has been great about replacing them but they still break down after 4-6 months . Once the warranty is up I 'm going to be looking for a new monitor set up .  
1	  This was a total scam . Arrived with absolutely no way to hook it up to a computer . No cord , nothing . They did take it back and give me my money back , though .  
2	  Easy to install ; easy to use ; recordings are just as good as originals ; record DVD to DVD , VHS to DVD , DVD to VHS  
1	  Almost feel like made for children 's hands . I have reg sized women 's hands and would get cramps after using these . Have another 2 button Logitech mouse ( w / out the cute zebra stripes ) and love it so I thought I was safe in ordering these . Cannot keep . description should say they are minis . Roller is also very gravelly feeling & does not move smoothly . Returning the 2 I bought with a sad heart bc the zebra design is so darn cute . RATS ! Back to my old boring mouse ..  
2	  really good machine .. voice messages was so good I didn't take my eyes of the road .. recalcilating was excelent .. never got lost  
2	  The latest isn't necessarily the best . I chose the Palm IIx , rather than the Palm V , because of its flexibility , upgrade ability and larger memory . I 'm glad I did . It substitutes for all sorts of bulkier electronics and on-paper tasks . It travels everywhere with me and keeps me current . Highly recommended !
